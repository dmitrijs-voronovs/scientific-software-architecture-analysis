When we have an external state + matching scheme, the boundary condition values are not exactly the external state and are modified by the matching scheme. I see your point. For e.g. gradient boundary conditions it feels like the ""boundary condition value"" being the gradient at the boundary has about as much meaning as the boundary condition value for an open boundary condition being the external state and then we do some matching to get the internal solution to approximate it.

My intuition from seeing results from papers (and from previous LES+IBM at my previous group) is that partial step cells would be almost as accurate as shaved cells (at least for oceanic cases with mild bathymetry slopes) but significantly simpler to implement. Since we already have the full-cell grid-fitted IBM it might be better to just focus on that for now and later modify it to make it partial-step when everything is working well (I think we'd just need to modify the calculation of vertical areas and volumes, no?). Also, when running ocean LES the aspect ratios are generally isotropic (Δz/Δx~1) but the bathymetry slopes are very small, which means that for some cases even full-step grid-fitted IBM might be enough.

Modifiability,"> I wasn't specific about time because I wasn't sure. I often find myself spending way longer on PRs than I initially anticipate so I'm generally not very good at assessing these things lol. ok ok! Here's a rule of thumb: a bugfix or refactor is the least committment, because you can get away with no new tests or docs. A new _feature_ takes more time because of documentation. One should expect to spend most of their time on docs and tests. If you're spending a lot of time implementing a feature, then either the feature is very complicated / hard, or your workflow can use some improvement. Among new features, different types of features require different amount of effort. This case is one of the easier cases --- it's extending functionality without changing existing functionality, also its fairly niche (at this point) so simple documentation will suffice. The work required to test the feature also has already been partially completed (the script you posted). Other features, like adding new _physics_ will take much longer, because often you'll have to run a full validation case + analysis to assess whether things work as expected. So even if the source code change is small to implement new physics, the validation will take a while and dominate the development effort. If a new feature also requires changing existing functionality / refactoring, that's going to take the most amount of time, because you will probably also have to change existing tests.

Modifiability,"> I'd love to hear feedback about this design.; ; Maybe I'm personally quite picky about specifying outputs and output file names, so I might always end up with verbose boilerplate for output writing (and I'm personally fine with that). But I'd support reducing boilerplate and maybe just a bit of flexibility would work even for picky people! I remember having this conversation in #1171 actually!. One-line flexible output writing would be especially great for examples, new user friendliness, and quick iteration. Some thoughts:; 1. I think the name `output!` is a bit vague in what it does. Does it just output the current state of the simulation? Would `add_output_writers!` be clearer and align more closely with existing Oceananigans nomenclature? For the same reason, I'd suggest keeping `add_callback!` over renaming to `callback!`.; 2. I frequently output both JLD2 and NetCDF versions of the exact same data. So ideally subsequent calls to `add_output_writers!` with `JLD2Format()` and `NetCDFFormat()` would add both.; 3. Would definitely support extending this to NetCDF as well!. > First, we need to default `with_halos=true` for JLD2OutputWriter. The time has come because `FieldTimeSeries` is mature. We do, in fact, want halos. Sounds good! Will be nice for derivatives to work by default.

Is the ""so much boilerplate"" just the extra one line `overwrite_existing = true` for each output writer?

Modifiability,"> I'm assuming this is a relatively simple issue to resolve?. Unfortunately not due to our current algorithm that we inherited from MITgcm, but which we hope to change pretty soon. Right now Oceananigans splits up the pressure into the hydrostatic pressure anomaly and the non-hydrostatic pressure (see https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/numerical_implementation/pressure_decomposition/). MITgcm did this to facilitate easy switching between a hydrostatic mode and a non-hydrostatic mode: to turn a non-hydrostatic model into a hydrostatic one, just don't compute the non-hydrostatic pressure and recompute w from the continuity equation. But we feel we can use multiple dispatch to implement a hydrostatic model in Julia. This algorithm also requires extra memory (2 pressure fields instead of just 1). So we're hoping to change the algorithm to only use 1 pressure field and get rid of this pressure decomposition. The algorithm also makes it difficult to implement tilted gravity because the hydrostatic pressure anomaly is computed as. ```; pHY′ = ∫ buoyancy_perturbation dz from z=0 down to z=-Lz; ```. where `buoyancy_perturbation = g * (αT - βS)` if you're using a linear equation of state. So now if gravity is tilted it's not just a vertical integral. I'm actually not sure how to modify the vertical integral if gravity is tilted... Seemed easier to move away from this vertical integral by not decomposing pressure then we should be able to easily add in support for tilted gravity via a `bg⃗` term in the momentum equation where `g⃗ = g⃗(x, y, z)` can be whatever the user wants.

As far as I can tell when people say they use ""Gent-McWilliams"" they are referring to a constant skew diffusivity (typically 0.3 m^2 / s).

We've mostly been running oceanic mixed layer simulations with a focus on vertical mixing so no need for a ton of horizontal resolution, but we do have horizontal mixing problems in mind at which point we'll need to start running on multiple GPUs with MPI. This is something we're starting to get serious about as we do need it ourselves. Not sure how coarse you can go but if you can go down to ~10⁸ grid points then maybe Oceananigans can be useful.

Hopefully this is not confusing or surprising... :-/ An alternative is perhaps to specifically delineate between them; ie change the keyword argument in the `Model` constructor to `solution_boundary_conditions`. However, something to consider is that the `tendency` and `pressure` fields of `ModelBoundaryConditions` should be uniquely determined by `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. Another factor to consider is that the pattern that keyword arguments correspond to fields is not a guaranteed julia pattern, it is simply an organizational principle that we feel is helpful.

Modifiability,"> This is looking pretty good! My only comment is that it's not intuitive for a given user to figure out how to opt for a hydrostatic pressure separation. A flag called `separate_hydrostatic_pressure` that takes `true`/`false` would be much more intuitive, although we'd need a little more code. Should we prioritize user-friendliness here?. This is more flexible, because sometimes users want to have access to the pressure field prior to model construction. If we use a flag, then we either can't support that or have to put some annoying logic in the constructor. Since I feel it'll be rare that people want to change this kwarg, I think the trade-offs work out that its better to have a simpler constructor even if those rare users that want to separate hydrostatic pressure have to build `CenterField`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3574#issuecomment-2088676711:355,flexible,flexible,355,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3574#issuecomment-2088676711,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Also is it ok if I convert to discussion? If it remains an issue we might lose track of it when the issue is closed. But this might be useful to people if its more visible. > Why you need to define f², wouldn't work simply using ∂zᶠᶜᶠ and squaring the operation?. Because we need to interpolate `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` using `ℑxzᶜᵃᶜ`. Note that Oceananigans operators (derivatives, interpolation, differences) are _composable_. The function `f²` is used in this composition --- it squares a _function_, rather than a _field_. So `ℑxzᶜᵃᶜ(i, j, k, grid, f², ∂zᶠᶜᶠ, U.u)` represents a stencil that interpolates `∂zᶠᶜᶠ(i, j, k, grid, u)^2` from `Face` to `Center` in both x and z. > For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then set! the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Yes, your question makes a lot of sense! The reason we can't do that is because _type_ of any of the properties of `model` cannot change. This means we need to know the type of `model.closure` _before_ we build it. Another way to say this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model.

Talked briefly about this with @zhenwu0728 earlier and was suggesting something along those lines for the physics too. I could imagine additional applications for configs like these and am willing to help with e.g. exploring the parameter space a bit if needed. Maybe the simplest, yet rather tunable, approach I could think of would be something like:. - at the top: warming (e.g. via relaxation to SST0) + wind stress to mechanically generate turbulence; - below a certain depth z1: cooling (e.g. via relaxation to T1<SST0) to restore to positive stratification. I feel that this simple approach should lead to a statistically steady stratification within an appropriate ranges of [SST0 T1 z1] and piston velocities. . With this basic config in place, which maybe is not far from your `examples/ocean_wind_mixing_and_convection.jl`, my guess is that adding a diel or seasonal mixed layer deepening is straightforward -- e.g. via a time variation in SST0.

Modifiability,"> then we'd have to rewrite loads of stuff to make it so the user can specify whatever they want for the external state. I think see your point (I'm not sure I grasp the totality of it). Is your point that we are able to _re-use_ more existing code if we allow `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` and `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` as `condition`? I didn't understand this previously so thank you for clarifying. To re-use that code with a new `condition`, we can use a nesting technique:. ```julia; function getbc(open_bc::OpenBoundaryCondition, ...); state_value = getbc(open_bc.condition.external_state, ...); # other stuff related to matching; end; ```. This means that we don't have to rewrite anything, we just add new functionality for open boundary conditions on top. You could make the point that we have less _new_ code to write though, if we implement a design that allows conditions to be the same. And for users, this could be clearer, so I see the advantage of that. On the flip side, the advantage of making a new `OpenCondition` is that `getbc` retains its meaning as ""the function that returns the boundary condition value"".

Modifiability,"@francispoulin thanks for starting this discussion!. Broadly speaking I think we would like to implement an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian vertical coordinate in the long run. As far as I understand, implementing an ALE scheme would require more changes than just a new `AbstractGrid`. We need to modify the time-stepping to include a regridding / interpolation stage, and I believe we also need to change the equations being solved (the tendency kernels). . My preliminary thought on software design is that this might be a new model property, something like `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Then one needs to interpret the z-coordinate in the chosen `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.grid` in light of the choice of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Other design ideas are certainly welcome!. Something less clear is what happens if we design a terrain following coordinate. Perhaps you are write @francispoulin that terrain following coordinates can be implemented purely by introducing a new type of grid (because the grid is not moving... ?) I think terrain-following, curvilinear grid would require three-dimensionally curvilinear operators, correct? So we would have to update the implementation of the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` operators as well.

When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!; I know this parameterization is very simple, but implementing it on a FORTRAN-based GCM from scratch would take waaaay more time, at least for me. Can you help me to see if I understood everything correctly? Please, sorry if I am asking too-trivial questions. Why you need to define `f²`, wouldn't work simply using `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` and squaring the operation?. I understand that you create a fake model and don't run it, simply use it to update the auxiliary field. I don't understand why you could not do the same for the main model. For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then `set!` the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Does that makes sense? I understand the in the background this might not work the way it is now. Something like this:. ```; model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). Ri = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Center, Center, Center}(Riᶜᶜᶜ, grid, computed_dependencies=(model.velocities, model.tracers.b))). ν = ν₀ + ν₁ / (1 + c * Ri^n); κᵇ = κ₀ + κ₁ / (1 + c * Ri^(n+1)). closure = ScalarDiffusivity(VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization(); ν, κ=(; b=κᵇ)). set!(model, closure = closure, auxiliary_fields = (; Ri)); ```. Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary.

Modifiability,"@peterahrens thanks for that tip!. @vchuravy, by closure-specific temporary variables (or fields), I am referring to domain-size quantities that can be re-used in computing the contribution of an LES closure to the 'source terms' for momentum and tracers. In other words, [this line, which computes the source term for `u`](https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a544300cabe6f8d872b7f9658284cad34c8619ad/src/time_steppers.jl#L223) could become something like. ```julia; kernel_temporaries!(subgrid_closure, ..., i, j, k); Gu[i, j, k] = ... + subgrid_closure.u(subgrid_closure_temporaries, ..., i, j, k); ```. ... I think. In physical terms, the intermediate variable is an 'eddy viscosity' that acts on all momentum terms. But I guess when I say the computation 'will benefit' from variables to store intermediate results, what I really mean is that I'm expecting the calculation of this temporary variable to be fairly involved (potentially >20 derivatives of velocity and tracer fields in x, y, z, plus scalar operations to combine the fields, and a 'clipping' function to make sure the viscosity is not negative --- see [the formula for the eddy viscosity predictor](https://dedales.readthedocs.io/en/latest/closures/anisotropic_minimum_dissipation.html#the-eddy-viscosity-predictor)).

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri discussed the pros and cons of implementing this ""single process version"" of `MultiRegion`. ### Cons. The main con is the difficulty in maintaining code for `MultiRegionGrid` and `MultiRegionObject`, plus `apply_regionally!`. The difficulties we face here are identical to the issues that have plagued our maintenance of `CubedSphereGrid`: the need to redispatch and `apply_regionally!` a huge number of methods on `MultiRegionGrid` creates extensive cross dependencies between ""local"" implementations and their multi-region versions. This is unbelievably annoying to maintain when refactoring or adding features to existing local implementations. We can mitigate the above issue with (i) clever and careful code design and (ii) potentially a bit of metaprogramming, similar to how `@kernel` and `adapt(to, obj)` achieve CPU/GPU polymorphism. ### Pros. We identified 3 main pros:. 1. We can run problems distributed across many GPUs, or cubed sphere problems on GPU or CPU, on a single process without an MPI dependency. This is a huge win for user experience, interactivity, and ease-of-use (users don't need to invoke `mpiexec`). 2. Related to 1, we can debug complex multiregion applications (like the cubed sphere) without MPI. This is important, given the complexity of the cubed sphere (and extensions / generalizations of the quasi-unstructured cubed sphere algorithm). 3. CUDA provides functionality that works on multi-GPU nodes: CUDA FFT, matrix algebra, etc. Being able to launch these utilities from a single Julia process may greatly simplify the implementation of GPU-distributed elliptic solvers.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426:600,refactor,refactoring,600,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426,3,"['adapt', 'polymorphi', 'refactor']","['adapt', 'polymorphism', 'refactoring']"
Modifiability,"A ""dynamic function invocation"" means that the compiler thinks a function is being called whose scope can change ""dynamically"" (I think). This is the error one gets when a function depends on a global variable that is not `const` (for example). In this case, the error tells us that the types of the objects involved in calling `getindex` defined on `BinaryOperation`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/c3b688f9ef125faeac3aa9d7fd57f0dd2d392380/src/AbstractOperations/binary_operations.jl#L34. are not correctly inferred. The way getindex comes into play is in the kernel function `_compute!` that evaluates the `AbstractOperation`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/c3b688f9ef125faeac3aa9d7fd57f0dd2d392380/src/Fields/computed_field.jl#L84-L87. calling `getindex(operand, i, j, k)` (or equivalently `operand[i, j, k]`) triggers recursive `getindex` calls that traverse the `AbstractOperation` tree. It seems that when the tree is too large, this traversal cannot be entirely compiled. Perhaps there are tricks we might use to help the compiler parse this kind of operation, like putting some type annotations / hints into `getindex(b::BinaryOperation, ...)`. Not sure. Another possibility is to figure out how to simplify the object `BinaryOperation`, `MultiaryOperation`, so that the compiler is less stressed trying to compile them... ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738838140:201,variab,variable,201,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738838140,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"A ""schedule"" is a function or callable object with a method. ```julia; schedule(model); ```. that returns true or false based on a criterion. `true` means ""do something"". The cleanest way to get this feature is to refactor the output writers to have a more generic interface for splitting. If we have a property called `file_splitting` that _is_ a schedule, then we can write. ```julia; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs; file_splitting = TimeInterval(30days), ...); ```. Then the decision about whether to start a new file will change from. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L275. to. ```julia; writer.file_splitting(model) && start_next_file(model, writer) ; ```. Next, you will have to add a new schedule in `Utils/schedules.jl` that can split based on filesize:. ```julia; mutable struct FileSizeLargerThan <: AbstractSchedule; max_filesize :: Float64; path :: String; end. (fslt::FileSizeLargerThan)(model) = filesize(fslt.path) >= fslt.max_filesize; ```. Finally, you need to add a user interface for initializing and modifying the schedules to smooth out the user experience (for example, we don't want users to have to specify the file path more than once, and the file path that is checked by the schedule has to be updated). This will have to take two parts. In `Utils/schedules.jl`, a constructor:. ```julia; FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize) = FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize, """"); ```. Then in output writers, an interface to be used in both the model constructor and `write_output!`:. ```julia; update_schedule!(schedule, path) = nothing; update_schedule!(schedule::FileSizeLargerThan, path) = schedule.path = path; ```. This function `update_schedule!(writer.schedule, path)` then replaces this line. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L276. and also needs to be added in the output writer constructor ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2967#issuecomment-2000029793:214,refactor,refactor,214,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2967#issuecomment-2000029793,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Useful tips in this regard are; - Try to use higher-order schemes as you need fewer grid points to achieve the same resolution; - Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor the memory usage of the GPU; - Manually define scratch space to be reused in diagnostics, to avoid creating one scratch space for each separate diagnostic you have.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575:281,variab,variables,281,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

My last attempt at improving the NetCDF solved many of the issues with the package https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl/pull/61 but was not merged because of conflicts with other bugfix PRs. However, might be source of inspiration if someone wants to do a rewrite. . Regarding write performance, I would be very interested to see examples where NetCDF.jl performs worse than e.g. python-netcdf4, since most of the time should be spent in the same NetCDF C library. I have been using the package extensively and did not experience it to be slower than comparable packages. . I you are worried about the robustness of NetCDF.jl, you should not even look at ZarrNative.jl, since it is still very young and rather a prototype. . I would be very happy to discuss the issues further, maybe in a call?

Modifiability,"Hi @c42f thank you for chiming in! Will definitely ping you as we work on logging. I think we probably should have tackled logging much earlier. We still use `@printf` and vanilla `@info` for logging, which has been quite counter-productive haha. Definitely hoping we can reach a useful logger that can; * help developers by providing info and debug messages. Also nice in test logs.; * help users understand what the model is doing and provide a better and more responsive user experience by logging what the model is doing. This is where `@setup` and `@diagnostic` logging messages might be really nice. Although `@setup` and `@diagnostic` might be bad names as they don't imply logging? Not sure of the best solution but maybe your kwarg suggestion would help here, e.g. `@info source=""diagnostic"" msg`?. @arcavaliere seems to be developing a pretty general-purpose `ModelLogger` which hopefully we can adapt for all these uses! @arcavaliere I'm more than happy to help if you need anything. MicroLogging.jl looks pretty neat! I like that it puts the log level, file name, and line number on the right as putting them on the left causes messages not to align and makes logs harder to read.

Modifiability,"Hmmm - I am skeptical about that from a computer point of view? In an implicit algorithm and/or radiative transfer alg the next step often depends on the result of the previous steps. . As every CCE graduate student learns, computers take many tens of cycles to evaluate an operation like a an add or multiply. The operation is sequential and carried out in a multi-stage pipeline in the heart of a CPU (or GPU). So unless the compiler has something else for the processor to do, the processor will have to wait for one step to make it through the pipeline before the next step? . I think the normal way to do this is to have some inner horiz blocking that is flexible (and can be 1,1) and then iterate over levels with some intermediate stores? The horiz block can be some fraction of inner cache or GPU local proc shared mem. The math doesn't quite look at this way because it assumes that a+b and/or a*b etc.. happen ""instantaneously"". It does not take into account that the awnser from a*b might take; 5-10 clock cycles to pass through the CPU floating point unit. . I think that is fairly generally true?

Modifiability,"Hmmm, do we know why we can't adapt the full `Field` to work inside GPU kernels? I think you said you've tried it but ran into some issues a while back?. The definition is; ```julia; struct Field{X, Y, Z, A, G, B} <: AbstractField{X, Y, Z, A, G}; data :: A; grid :: G; boundary_conditions :: B; ```; where the `grid` has been adapted, `data` is usually an offset array which has also been adapted, and I thought individual boundary conditions have been adapted as well so feels like it should be easy to adapt the full `Field`. Note: `boundary_conditions` is a named tuple of `FieldBoundaryConditions` so maybe we just need to adapt `FieldBoundaryConditions`, `CoordinateBoundaryConditions`? Hmmm but they're really named tuples so maybe they're already adapted. If we can't adapt `Field` then yeah the adapt rules you've suggested sound pretty good and would simplify the time stepping a lot. The kernels already deal with data tuples so not much would even have to change I think.

Modifiability,"I draft a repo on this matter [here](https://github.com/iuryt/Bioceananigans.jl).; I tried to summarize my ideas in the README:. > Most of the interelationships between biogeochemical tracers could be implemented using the **forcing functions** (see [Convecting Plankton](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/generated/convecting_plankton/) example from Oceananigans documentation), but commonly the light or light-limiting growth of the phytoplankton are **averaged over the mixed layer** in order to parameterized the effects of the mixing in the upper boundary layer. In other words, the mixing timescale is usually longer than photosynthesis, but shorter than cell-division time, which makes phytoplankton **see the average light or grow at the average light-limiting growth rate** while on the mixed layer. Other example of processes that are not easily implemented on Oceananigans include the **shading of phytoplankton** to deeper layers and the **sinking velocity**. The latter is currently being implemented on Oceananigans by this [Pull Request](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389) with a new forcing called `AdvectiveForcing`.; > ; > For now, this repository basically gives a set of modules that can be used to estimate the mixed-layer depth, estimate the phytoplankton shading and calculate the light-limiting growth, which is defined by the user as a function, and then the light (or the light-limiting growth) can be averaged over the mixed layer. So basically the repository can simply give all auxiliary functions that are needed for the biogeochemical models, but not the interelationship functions, which can be defined as forcing functions and added to a list of examples on the documentation.

Modifiability,"I started tackling this issue in ClimaAtmos last week. I wrote a module, `OutputPathGenerator`, in a separate utilities package ([documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaUtilities.jl/dev/outputpathgenerator/)). This module defines an object, `OutputPathGenerator` that can be extended with different `OutputPathGeneratorStyle`s. ; The `OutputPathGenerator` is used in a `generate_output_path` function that takes the base output dir and the style.; The simplest of such styles is ""overwrite"". . The style that is currently being used in Atmos is `ActiveLinkStyle`. Citing from the docs:; > This style provides a more convenient and non-destructive approach. It manages a sequence of subfolders within the base directory specified by `output_path`. It also creates a symbolic link named `output_active` that points to the current active subfolder. This allows you to easily access the latest simulation results with a predictable path. > Example:; > Let's assume your output_path is set to data.; > If data doesn't exist, the module creates it and returns data/output_active. This link points to the newly created subfolder data/output_0000.; > If data exists and contains an output_active link pointing to data/output_0005, the module creates a new subfolder data/output_0006 and updates output_active to point to it.; > If data exists with or without an output_active link, the module checks for existing subfolders named data/output_XXXX (with XXXX a number). If none are found, it creates data/output_0000 and a link data/output_active pointing to it. Atmos uses `OutputPathGenerator` internally. My vision is that end users would be providing the base path and possibly choosing a `Style` if they don't want the default behavior (which is the ActiveLinkStyle). `Styles` are Julia objects and new ones can be defined in scripts by implementing a method for the function `generate_output_path`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662:280,extend,extended,280,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662,1,['extend'],['extended']

Without it you would have to explicitly write `u .+ avgx(avgy(v))` so if you forget it then it might make finding the bug a bit harder. With it, you can just write `u .+ v` with the averaging happening behind the scenes, so you might apply it by mistake without realizing it. Another potentially difficult bug to find.

Modifiability,"I think what we want in terms of API is the ability to specify boundary conditions on the surface of an immersed boundary. One design would be to introduce a type called `ImmersedBoundary` that collects information about the location of the boundary and the boundary conditions for each field prescribed on it. This could be relatively simple to implement in the code, though it doesn't exactly conform to our current code design in which boundary conditions are embedded in `Field` objects. Another possibility that may better conform to our current boundary conditions / field design would be to embed `boundaries` in `grid` objects. With this design, `ImmersedBoundary` collects only information about its geometry and parameters related to its numerical implementation (eg regularization functions, interpolation methods, etc). We can then infer from `grid` the information needed to define boundary conditions for fields in both (`x` ,`y`, `z`), as well as on any `ImmersedBoundary`s. Grid constructors would then be something like. ```julia; grid = RegularCartesianGrid(; immersed_boundaries = ImmersedBoundary(geometry = # a function of (x, y, z, t); transfer_function = # parameters ; ); topology = # etc; ); ```; ; As for verification, I think we should use a quantitative test that verifies that boundary conditions are satisfied on the immersed boundary.

I think it makes sense `model` is a field of `Simulation`. Its simple to envision `Simulation` parameters that are identical, with a different underlying `model` (eg, changing the number of passive tracers)`. The way I envision a logical course for the development of complex software in general is that we start with the fundamental building blocks and make them as easy to use in their low-level form as possible. When we've decided we can proceed no farther, we add another layer of abstraction that fuses these underlying building blocks into a higher-order coherent object. And so on.

Modifiability,"I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example. I Think this works quite well since a lot of BGC models write the sinking terms with the other forcing terms, but its a little cumbersome to write e.g. `sinking = div_Uc(i, j, k, grid, bgc.adv_scheme, bgc.u⃗ᵖ, fields.P)`, and model makers will need to do the setup stuff I've done to make the advective velocity fields.

Modifiability,"Interesting! Good find. This not the only thing to worry about regarding the entrainment diffusivity. It's effect also seems to depend on vertical resolution, and it only seems useful at low resolutions. In general, I recommend switching to CATKEVerticalDiffusivity, where we have put a lot of effort into solving those problems. I'm going to suggest a different solution that setting some maximum capping diffusivity. I think setting a maximum diffusivity could work, but that there are better solutions that more directly address the underlying issue. I think the issue here is that ""entrainment"" should not occur across low stratification regions. Thus this model for ""entrainment"" assumes the stratification is ""strong"". More generally, we are dividing the boundary layer into a convecting region and an entraining region. We identify the convecting region by `N² < 0`. However, in reality the convecting region should extend further down into regions of stable, but still weak stratification below the unstable region. The ""entraining"" layer is more properly where stratification significantly increases over the weakly stratified lower part of the convecting region. (This analysis is based on LES.) `RiBasedVerticalDiffusivity`'s formulation --- apart from being overly simple --- simply cannot cope with the complexity of real boundary layer structure because it is not truly non-local. Really addressing this issue (eg implementing a more physically accurate model of boundary layer structure) might require using a vertical integral instead of a 3D kernel. (We decided that because CATKE seems like a decent parameterization, it's not worth it to pursue those accuracy improvements). One way to fix the issue but retaining a 3D kernel is to change the way we estimate ""convecting"" and ""entraining"" regions. Those criteria are. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/94e99e1d5fb3d121a6d801a931987bb6ff59f20e/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/ri_based_vertical_d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718:923,extend,extend,923,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718,1,['extend'],['extend']

E.g.,. ```Julia; function compute_this_and_that(model::ShallowWaterModel{1}); a = 1 # simple calculation for single-layer models; return a; end. function compute_this_and_that(model::ShallowWaterModel); number_of_layers = model.number_of_layers; a = sum(rand(number_of_layers)) # more complicated stuff only needed for multi-layer models; return a; end; ```.

Modifiability,"Just a quick thought: mathematically it sometimes makes sense to use boundary conditions to reduce the size of the function space a variable can live in, i.e. considering a certain field to be in the space of functions that have zero value (or zero normal derivative) at a boundary. Physically, though, I'm not sure this is so useful, since many systems have non-trivial boundary conditions, including nonlinear conditions and conditions involving multiple fields. Then the notion of a certain BC even ""belonging"" to a certain field is a little less clear... you may just have a set of fields that need to collectively satisfy a set of conditions on the boundary.

Modifiability,"Just as an update --- we actually currently cannot do this verification experiment because of a problem with LES models (a theoretical problem, not an implementation problem) with specified buoyancy flux boundary conditions and zero stress boundary conditions. In short, we observe grid-scale oscillations in the near-surface buoyancy gradient when buoyancy fluxes are specified. The primary issue is associated with a too-small near-surface LES diffusivity. . I want to emphasize that this is not a numerical issue with boundary condition specification, or a bug in the LES implementation --- this is a fundamental, theoretical problem with LES formulation. Others have observed this issue before with a variety of LES formulations, so this issue is not particular to AMD, either. I'm working on a fix because this is an important, canonical problem. The easiest way to fix the problem is to allow the LES model constant (which we should view as a free parameter) to vary in space and in particular to increase near the wall. This is simple, yet completely empirical solution. . The level of empiricism / near-wall enhancement of the model constant needed for a smooth solution is mitigated somewhat if we can specify the gradient of buoyancy / temperature on the boundary. This second component of the fix can be done by introducing a wall model on top of the interior LES formulation that applies *on* boundaries. The wall model introduces a second free parameter in addition to the interior LES free parameter. Adjusting the wall model's free parameter allows us to ""effectively"" increase the near-wall value of the AMD diffusivity. An even better, more complete fix would also modify the interior LES model near the wall.

I think we've also discussed making this default, since its simple... As for the distinction between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models I agree that with currently supported configurations, `NonhydrostaticRigidLid` is better than `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I'm only hesitant about this change because I wonder if we may want to combine these two models in the future. The motivation to develop `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` separately is largely practical and caves to short term timeline pressures (it's easier to break things when nobody's using it, and we throw a warning right in the constructor so people know its experimental). In the long run it might make sense to have just a single interface to all incompressible models and support all combinations of hydrostatic, non-hydrostatic, free surface / rigid lid, etc through a single interface, similar to what MITgcm offers. The interfaces / model specific code is expensive to maintain, which motivates having just one interface. If this is our goal, it'd be premature to change the name of `IncompressibleModel`. If people feel they'd like to commit to maintaining two interfaces / model constructors / time-stepping code then I think changing the name to be clearer but less general is an option to consider.

Here's a couple of comments, might have more later. > The current implementation I have going projects the velocity into tangential and normal directions (with respect to the immersed surface) before interpolating over the boundary. Since the boundary can be pretty variable in made more sense for us to take this approach. So the user would specify what they want the two tangential and 1 normal direction to be instead of (u,v,w) specifically. Right, this is what I mean by having an ""abstraction for vectors"" --- awesome! If the momentum equation is treated in vector form then the three components are coupled. User specification is then on the vector momentum equation; users will specify `VelocityBoundaryConditions` (rather than boundary conditions for each component, and `VectorForcing`, rather than forcing on each component. It may also make sense to coalesce the kernels that compute tendencies for each velocity component (but I'm less sure about that).

Modifiability,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there.

Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged.

Modifiability,"Perhaps worth stating here that I think RK3 is vastly superior to AB2 not only because of the faster time-to-solution but also because it is ""self-starting"" (does not depend on tendencies from previous time-steps), checkpointing is cheaper and simplified, and the chance of bugs (which cost us nearly 6 months during parameterization development in the past) wherein ""restarted"" simulations can fail when the prior tendencies have NaN _even_ if we attempt to start with an Euler time-step.

Modifiability,"Probably not the best use of time to try to get `reverse` to work. But if someone is interested in looking further, we can see that `reverse` starts by building a new object with `copymutable`:. https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/d7dc9a8cc8f2aebf04d5cecc8625be250169644b/base/arraymath.jl#L59-L60. `copymutable` works correctly because it relies on 1) `similar` and 2) `copyto!`, both of which we define for `Field`. So that's nice, showing the power of extending those functions. The error that @siddharthabishnu finds occurs because we haven't defined `view` for `CartesianIndices`.

Modifiability,"So in summary, a future effort should take these steps:. 1. Write a function like `substepped_tracers(bgc::AbstractBiogeochemistry)` that can be extended by a hypothetical substepping BGC implementation.; 2. Prototype this concept by implementing a new (hopefully simple, one tracer) BGC model, and prototype the time-stepping algorithm that substeps the tracer forward during `update_biogeocemical_state!`. This should be easy to merge since it only requires defining the one new function `substepped_tracers` for skipping the tracer update. Furthermore, the prototype will demonstrate that the substepping is useful for a stiff problem, and will also develop a substepping scheme. Next, we can consider building an interface for doing the substepping itself, much like we have an interface for doing ordinary time-stepping.

Modifiability,"Some pretty promising Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks!. Couple of takeaways (all assuming a model with 128^3 grid points and QAB2 time stepping):; 1. **Low overhead**: You can advect up to ~100,000 particles on the CPU and up to ~10,000,000 particles on a (Titan V) GPU before the model slows down by more than 30%.; 2. **Great on GPUs**: Seems that the GPU is great for advecting millions of particles. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this.

Modifiability,"Sorry about the GPU errors, they're much scarier than they look! Looks like a pretty involved setup so I'll let @glwagner comment on the setup. In this case it looks like Julia is complaining about an `unsupported dynamic function invocation (call to overdub)` in `Fxn_scale` at line 93. ```julia; @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. which itself is calling some kind of spline. ```julia; spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, df.scale, k=1) ; ```. Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660:974,variab,variable,974,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660,1,['variab'],['variable']

The GPU shared memory is basically a programmable cache while the cache of CPU can't be (easily) controlled. In both cases there is cache so, if you compute multiple partial derivatives of a given (set of) field(s) (d/dx,d/dy, d2/dx2,...) once a block has been fetched in the cache then the memory operations are cheap. Cache is also useful for performing tiny transpositions enabling fast access and vectorized (SIMD) CPU or GPU ops in both X,Y or Z directions. .

Modifiability,"Thank you for the written explanation! Here are my comments:. > to split the bgc tendencies from the rest I needed a way to turn them off in the normal tendency computation, I did this by passing a keyword all the way through to biogeochemical_transitions - when I did it this way the intention was to touch as little of the existing code as possible, but it might not be the cleanest/most maintainable. I don't think we need to change anything in the existing kernels code. Instead, we can design an interface that allows biogeochemical models (like the models implemented in OceanBioME) to ""opt-in"" to a substepping scheme. In this design, there's no need to change the existing ""slow"" kernels I don't think. However, we could consider changing the name of them. For example, all that's needed is for the _implementation_ to know when to return a slow source term vs fast source term. > this is where I had to make some more changes to the existing code (and probably the messiest part of what I did), because the code often expects the tendencies to live at timestepper.G / $G^-$, so I made functions that dispatched on the timestepper and usually returned that, but for the new timestepepr returned timestepper.physics.G etc. I'm not sure that new tendencies are needed for substepping.

Modifiability,"Thank you for your feedback @maleadt! What is CUDAnative compilation? If you mean the precompilation phase when CUDAnative is first loaded, then it's not that as I start timing after all packages are loaded. I thought 6-7 minutes was normal/expected as @vchuravy et al. reported similar GPU compilation times for their shallow water model: https://github.com/JuliaLabs/ShallowWaterBench. I haven't done any rigorous benchmarking yet but out of those 6 minutes, ~1.5 minutes are spent on compiling code that creates CuFFT plans (the first plan takes 1.5 minutes then the others take <1 second).

The `zF` suggests the result will be at faces and `stretch` suggests that this is a stretching of some kind. Or maybe `z_Faces_stretched`?. I am sorry if I mispoke. I did not mean to say that users do not care about what kind of stretched grid we use. This is clearly not the case. What I wanted to say is that a beginning user probably would be more concerned about having a stretched grid and probably not so much of the details. Some users would of course care a great deal about the kind of grid, and we definitely want to help both kinds of users. I agree with @glwagner 's suggestion of us supply a few basic examples for people to use, as a starting point. Users should certainly be able to take these examples, build on them, and build whatever kind of stretched grid they want. This is currently available and this should always be the case. When defining our examples we should not only define the region (or regions where we want it stretched, as it shouldn't only have to be one spot), but also the degree to which it decays. I don't necessarily have the language to describe this accurately now, but when putting together a sample function/array, I think a lot of this will beome clearer (to me at least).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145:201,variab,variable,201,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Thanks for looking through the time stepping code, this is great feedback!. I agree it would be nice to dispatch on the array type (or even the architecture, another reason to use types instead of symbols). No reason why `xC, xF, yC, ...` have no assigned type in `RegularCartesianGrid`, just oversight on my part. There will probably be a major refactor of the code's design soon-ish to get all this little stuff right. I remember fields initially had the array type be a parameter, e.g. `CellField{T}` then `data::T` but I hit some performance issues with that I think. I may have just been encountering the [Avoid fields with abstract containers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/index.html#Avoid-fields-with-abstract-containers-1) Julia performance tip, but I think making the parameter an `AbstractArray` as you're suggesting shouldn't sacrifice performance.

Interesting point about setting the vertical index to be the fastest running index to help speed up vertical integrals. We only have one vertical integral in the time stepping core so not sure if it'll make a big difference on the ocean side but something to think about! Might be relevant to #21.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the questions @simone-silvestri . I'll answer them here as it's probably easier for the discussion. **Q1**: You can certainly solve the equations in the non-conservative form and the method should work. But it does't have any advantages compared to other methods: i.e. doesn't help with conserving anything and does not easily extend to other geometries. **Q2**: The pressure term in the momentum equation is ` 1/\rho_0 \nabla p`. In the case of a rigid lid we have that `p` is the surface pressure. I thought that redefining pressure with ` p/\rho_p -> p` might be easier, to get rid of the constant, but it's easy enough to include the coefficent. We should continue to do whatever Oceananigans is currently doing, and I thought it was absorving the constant density, but I could be wrong. **Q3**: In the shallow water model with a free-surface the pressure is always hydrostatic, `p = p_0 + g \rho_0 (h - z)`, where `h` is the total depth. The case of a rigid lid is a bit different since we just have the surface pressure `p`. You are correct that the free-surface shallow water model is very similar to the 3D compressible Euler equations. The free-surface SW is a compressible model, which is why we don't have to solve any elliptic problem, and instead we simply integrate the three prognostic equations. . The rigid-lid SW model (which we don't have yet) is different of course. I am sure we can use the existing solves to determine the surface pressure as the hydrostatic model currently does. Here are some thoughts to consider:. 1. Introducing topography is pretty easy but when we do so, we should probably introduce a free-surface. Following the convention of the hydrostatic model seems like the way to proceed. Agreed?; 2. Visosity is not difficult to include but there's a question of which form of viscosity to include. The standard harmonic or biharmonic diffiusivities would be good choices, where they act on the velocities not the transport velocities.

Modifiability,"The advection-like Coriolis scheme was a non-sequitur because `f` is a very regular field, so upwinding it was just decreasing performance without a significative increase in quality of the simulation. On the other hand, upwinding `u` is very much discouraged because the energy builds up rapidly (by upwinding the velocity the divergence of the reconstructed tangential velocity is not a direct interpolation of the divergence of the original velocity, which is a necessary condition to maintain the algorithm stable). The only thing I can think to increase the order of velocity interpolation in the Coriolis force is to use a centered high-order scheme to interpolate velocity, but that would not help with the noise since a centered scheme is dispersive in nature. . I converted this PR to implement a `WetPointCoriolisScheme` (described in [Numerical boundary layers and spurious residual flows](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC091iC09p10621)). ; This is just a simple addition to an enstrophy conserving scheme where edge (""dry"") points are neglected in the interpolation of the velocity in the tangential direction.

Modifiability,"The convention we use for the other variables stored on faces is that our ""interior"" data spans from `i=1` to `i=N`. Thus we call the `i=N+1` a ""halo point"" for fields on faces, even though it really is not (its on the boundary, see #455). . In addition, we use a convention that face indices are ""left"" of cell indices. Thus `iFace=1` corresponds to the ""left"" boundary of the domain. `iCell=N` is the rightmost cell in the domain; and `iFace=N+1` corresponds to the rightmost boundary. Why do you want ""direct"" access to the surface at `k=Nz`? Can you explain why you want this? This is confusing to me and I don't see why we would want to have an odd and surprising convention for the vertical coordinate. The fact is simply that the face at `i=N` is a very concrete and real place. It lies in the interior of the domain, to the left of the cell point `i=N`. This is a fact of our grid and must be internalized by anyone who wants to work with the discrete data and index fields directly by raw index.

Modifiability,"Thinking about this more, I think it would make sense to make an even more radical change. I think we should add `diagnostics`, `output_writers`, and `clock` to `Simulation`. . The `time_step!` function then performs a single time-step, whereas to run a simulation one should write `run!(simulation)`, which handles diagnostics, output writing, adaptive time-stepping, and logging in an integrated way. This orthogonalizes the design a bit: `diagnostics` and `output_writers` are not really aspects of a ""model"", if we use a narrow interpretation of a model as a discrete representation of a physical system. A single physical system might conceivably be associated with a wide range of disparate diagnostics and output, depending on what kind of science is being done. I think scripts become clearer. The user writes. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). simulation = Simulation(model; simulation_parameters...). simulation.diagnostics[:diag] = # something. run!(simulation); ```. As an example to illustrate why `Simulation` is orthogonal to `Model`, here's a possible clear and coherent usage of this separation:. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). set!(model; first_interesting_initial_condition...). first_simulation = Simulation(model, first_simulation_parameters...); first_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_first_simulation; run!(first_simulation). set!(model; second_interesting_initial_condition...) # same physical model, but different starting initial condition... no new memory allocated, no recompilation --- fast. second_simulation = Simulation(model, second_simulation_parameters...); second_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_second_simulation; run!(second_simulation); ```.

Modifiability,"This kind of feature can't be implemented directly in `Forcing`, because all explicit tendency terms are evaluated in the same kernel. So we have to evaluate `forcing` in every cell that requires a tendency. It is possible to expose a feature that allows kernels to be launched over some subset of cells. Then users could implement this kind of optimization in their script by using an array to represent the forcing, and then by precomputing the forcing into that array using a kernel that only evaluates some subset of all the cells in a callback.

Modifiability,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`.

Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node.

Are they intended to be included in CI, or are they more in the style of “benchmarks” that are run relatively infrequently?. @edoddridge A twist on option 1 is to design a forcing that exactly cancels the terms associated with nonlinear and linear terms in a given equation for some simple initial condition consisting of sines and cosines. For example, pick an initial condition, calculate all terms in a given equation, and then write a forcing that exactly cancels those terms. Then check that the initial condition doesn’t change after a few time-steps. This method allows a test at low resolution with low computational burden and allows each nonlinear and linear term in each equation to be assessed separately. .

Modifiability,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately.

Modifiability,"Yes, that is pretty much what I had in mind but for a different physical problem. . There are a variety of ways one can do this. Below are a few that come to mind. 1. Power method: worked well for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and should work well for other problems. Two nice features are that it's pretty simple, and it's already coded up for one example so should be easy to adapt. One not so nice feature is that it only tells us the most unstable mode (spatial structure, growth rates and phase speed) but it doesn't tell us about any other unstable modes. 2. Arnoldi Method: A quick google search came across this [library](https://haampie.github.io/ArnoldiMethod.jl/stable/). I have not tried it but could try adapting it to the above mentioned KH problem. . 3. Standard eigenvals: If we assume periodicity in two directions it boils down to a 1D eigenvalue problem that should be easy to solve using eigenvals. There should be a direct solver that forms a full matrix and gives you all the eigenfunctions but the indirect uses Arnoldi and gives you some. . As for where they appera I don't kown but at some point, after I get a ShallowWaterModel off the ground, I will play around with different solvers and see what looks promising.

Modifiability,"Yesterday, @ali-ramadhan and I discussed a new idea for improving the abstraction of equations. The idea is to abstract a `RightHandSide` consisting of a tuple of `Flux`es and `VolumeTerm`s or `SourceTerm`s. Each `Flux` or `VolumeTerm` type would define a `getindex` method, and carry around the references needed to execute that `getindex` method on CPU or GPU. This would greatly simplify the time-stepping routines, which currently involve long function signatures. There'd be no need for 'unpacking', because each term in the equation would perform unpacking upon instantiation. It would also probably be easier for users to extend / add terms to an equation. As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```. We'd have functions that look something like. ```julia; function x_flux_divergence(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); incoming_flux = add_fluxes(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); outgoing_flux = add_fluxes(i+1, j, k, grid, fluxes...); return (incoming_flux - outgoing_flux) * grid.Ax / grid.V; end; ```. ... for example. Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope. A downside of this approach is that we can't use shared memory stencils on the GPU. Shared memory stencils on the GPU require _functions_ for all terms that avoid carrying around internal references to data (since we need to be able to pass them referen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/259#issuecomment-600078394:629,extend,extend,629,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/259#issuecomment-600078394,1,['extend'],['extend']

Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```.

There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to your setup?

We use the term ""node"" because this can be used for cells _or_ cell interfaces. `external_node` is `false` for locations that ""touch"" wet cells.; - `peripheral_node` identifies whether a location is either _on or external_ to the `Bounded` domain. So this intersects with `external_node` in the exterior, but additionally contains locations that touch wet cells.; - `immersed_peripheral_node` identifies locations that are on or external to the immersed domain, but _not_ external to the underlying grid domain (we need this so that we don't apply immersed boundary conditions at all peripheral nodes).; - `immersed_cell` is now the name of the function `is_immersed` --- immersed boundary implementations define this to obtain correct logic for boundary conditions.

Modifiability,"consider the tilted bottom boundary layer example: https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/literated/tilted_bottom_boundary_layer/. In this problem, the buoyancy is decomposed ($b=\bar{b} + b^{\prime}$) into a background component $\bar{b} = N^{2} \hat{z}$ (where $\hat{z}$ is positive in the direction opposite the gravitational vector) and the remaining perturbation. The current example script applies no boundary conditions to the perturbation buoyancy, which I believe defaults to a no-normal-flux condition at the top and bottom boundary. Because no boundary conditions are applied to the background field, there is an implied diffusive flux $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (-\kappa \nabla \bar{b}) = ±\kappa N^{2} \cos{\theta}$ across these boundaries. This means that the boundary condition on the total buoyancy is a non-zero flux across the seafloor, which does not make much sense for this problem. The normal way of implementing this problem is to apply a gradient boundary condition, $\frac{\partial b^{\prime}}{\partial z} = -N^{2}\cos{\theta}$, at the bottom, to impose the no-flux condition. (In my MITgcm configurations, I verified that implementing the boundary condition this way recovered the classical analytical solutions of [Garrett et al. 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.fl.25.010193.001451).

Modifiability,"e code/documentation and examples of Oceananigans. When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!; I know this parameterization is very simple, but implementing it on a FORTRAN-based GCM from scratch would take waaaay more time, at least for me. Can you help me to see if I understood everything correctly? Please, sorry if I am asking too-trivial questions. Why you need to define `f²`, wouldn't work simply using `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` and squaring the operation?. I understand that you create a fake model and don't run it, simply use it to update the auxiliary field. I don't understand why you could not do the same for the main model. For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then `set!` the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Does that makes sense? I understand the in the background this might not work the way it is now. Something like this:. ```; model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). Ri = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Center, Center, Center}(Riᶜᶜᶜ, grid, computed_dependencies=(model.velocities, model.tracers.b))). ν = ν₀ + ν₁ / (1 + c * Ri^n); κᵇ = κ₀ + κ₁ / (1 + c * Ri^(n+1)). closure = ScalarDiffusivity(VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization(); ν, κ=(; b=κᵇ)). set!(model, closure = closure, auxiliary_fields = (; Ri)); ```. Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. Including using any model in general that could come in a form of a function. For instance, a ML model could be simply used as a turbulence closure. Again, thanks for all attention you are giving to me. As a new user, it makes me learn more and more and maybe sometime I can also retribute by contributing to the model development.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066110688:1817,parameteriz,parameterizations,1817,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066110688,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterizations']
Modifiability,"e easier for users to extend / add terms to an equation. As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```. We'd have functions that look something like. ```julia; function x_flux_divergence(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); incoming_flux = add_fluxes(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); outgoing_flux = add_fluxes(i+1, j, k, grid, fluxes...); return (incoming_flux - outgoing_flux) * grid.Ax / grid.V; end; ```. ... for example. Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope. A downside of this approach is that we can't use shared memory stencils on the GPU. Shared memory stencils on the GPU require _functions_ for all terms that avoid carrying around internal references to data (since we need to be able to pass them references to shared memory blocks, rather than references to global memory. This is a fair rewrite of the code internals. For example, each term in the `u_velocity_tendency`:. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/8e3c27504be68ca06bacc7502cd6095ae390f8c6/src/TimeSteppers/velocity_and_tracer_tendencies.jl#L24. would get it's own type.

Modifiability,"e-dimensional. I'm not sure I understand the point about newbie mistakes though. > I also think a user can easily infer that z in the signature can be ignored if they just defined a grid with a Flat z topology, so I think the added user-friendliness is minor. It's true that in our examples, `set!` is typically invoked close to the grid definition. But such proximity is not guaranteed. In complicated applications (say for example a realistic simulation on the globe), a grid may be constructed ""for"" the user. One case that's come up recently is coupled ocean, sea-ice simulations. For a realistic case covering the globe, the user script may well not include the creation of the grid (which would happen within a helper function like `build_global_ocean_sea_ice_simulation`). Even if the grid construction is immediately readable, I think it's still weird to read. ```julia; initial_ice_thickness(x, y, z) = 1 # meter; ```. as determining sea ice thickness --- its nonsensical for the ice thickness to depend on `z`. Ice thickness _cannot_ depend on `z`. The z topology of a slab ice model cannot be anything but `Flat`; it doesn't make sense to have a z-coordinate. That's also true for the `ShallowWaterModel`. Also there function signatures depend on `z` despite that no shallow water field can possibly depend on the third coordinate. > (Maybe even negative since the signatures now can change based on topology(grid)?). I think it's correct to observe that this change does not prioritize _writing_ scripts --- it prioritizes the experience of _reading_ scripts. I think the scripts read better with this change. The purpose of ""function notation"" is to indicate the variables on which the function depends (usually including just dependent coordinates, like `x`, `y`, or `z`). In almost all contexts, we should not include irrelevant variables in a function signature.

You can always try with higher order (maybe 7th?) but the higher the order the lower the stability (i.e. at a certain order your implicit dissipation will be so low that you will start to generate grid-scale noise). . The KE dissipation is there with `closure=nothing` and a WENO scheme, it is just not strictly physical: it's (roughly) akin to a 4th to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. You can compare this to using `UpwindBiased(order = 5)` which would give you everywhere a dissipation that converges to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. In general:. $$\partial_x {uu}^{Upwind_N} \sim \partial_x {uu}^{Centered_{N+1}} + \partial_x {K_{numerical}} \partial_x^{N} u$$. where $K_{numerical} \sim \Delta x u$ and $N$ is the order. The nice thing about using WENO instead of a simple Upwind discretization is that the order of the hyperviscosity adapts to the smoothness of the field. Therefore, where the field is noisier (like in regions of higher gradients) the dissipation is more aggressive. . This procedure not only ensures a smooth field but can be thought of as mimicking the subgrid-scale dissipation (which also increases with the gradient of resolved scale variables. As such people have referred to using particularly diffusive advective schemes (such as WENO) as _Implicit_ LES. I like the idea of implicit LES because it allows you to ""fill in"" for the subgrid-scale dissipation without committing to any sophisticated formulation derived in a particularly idealized situation (take the example of Leith derived in homogeneous 2D turbulence and the geostrophic eddies in the ocean), and guarantees (or at least helps) stability. For this reason, it's pretty handy when you have different unresolved processes at different scales that may be characterized by different dissipation characteristi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433:1426,adapt,adapts,1426,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433,1,['adapt'],['adapts']
Modifiability,"hat sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time. I'm not sure. > Also wouldn't that also affect simulations with `buoyancy=nothing` if the pre-output time-step were to blame?. I think so, but I also don't think that you can guarantee this problem won't ever occur. The presence of the buoyancy does somehow impact the divergence that accumulates during a time-step / the pressure correction that has to be applied. So it's possible that the buoyancy configuration affects these results.

Modifiability,"he source code. As for the source code and the topic of this issue, I think it will be generally impossible to include the diffusivity fields in the model fields. First of all, closures and diffusivity fields can be user defined. We want people to be free to do creative things in closure design without having to worry about whether trying to merge the diffusivity fields into `model_fields` will cause their model to fail to compile, preventing them from doing work. However, it might be possible to ""whitelist"" some fields when the situation calls for it, like the eddy diffusivities in LES closures. For that we need to introduce a new function, something like `nonhydrostatic_fields` (mirroring the `hydrostatic_fields` we have now for the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`) which, unlike `fields`, is more low-level and not user facing. Then this function can be designed to take `closure` as an argument to support the inclusion of diffusivity fields where appropriate, something like. ```julia; @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(closure, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields) # fallback. @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(::SmagorinskyLilly, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields, (; νₑ=diffusivity_fields.νₑ)) # desired behavior; ```. then we can use that in the tendency kernel functions. I think this would probably succeed because we can simply omit the closures with too-complex diffusivity fields. It might require a bit more work for closure tuples though. It's an interesting idea for a contribution. But note that the current ways to solve this problem (creating a new field for the forcing, and then utilizing callbacks to compute the needed field during time stepping) are fairly straightforward and also generalize to much more complex situations that I'm not sure it makes sense to go down the rabbit hole of extending `model_fields` to cover more exotic situations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262:2450,extend,extending,2450,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262,1,['extend'],['extending']

Modifiability,"iguration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise we cannot launch `mpiexec` with 4 tasks (1 for each GPU). It's helpful to have the maximum number of CPUs for precompilation. Otherwise precompilation is very slow. I also set. ```; export JULIA_NUM_PRECOMPILE_TASKS=64; ```.

Modifiability,"in general. We currently handle this only during time-stepping --- there is no guarantee, for example, that the diffusivities or ghost cell values are consistent with the velocity field if the velocity field is set by the function `set!` (in fact, the diffusivities are *always* inconsistent with the current velocity field due to the fact that they are calculated *prior* to taking a time-step). If we want to guarantee such a consistency, we can develop the concept of a model ""state"" and apply it to both ocean and atmospheric models (eg a function `update_state!(model)`, or something similar). What does the jargon ""sounding"" mean?. Merger means we need to think carefully about how to reduce boilerplate to minimize (within reason) the cost of maintaining two parallel models as we develop their shared subcomponents. I wonder if splitting off the output writers and diagnostics into a `Simulation` type that wraps `AbstractModel` may help. In this paradigm, a ""Model"" is reduced to numerics + physics specification. This would be easy to implement (while I think an `Equation` abstraction would be relatively difficult due to myriad difficult design problems, including the abstraction of tuples of terms with heterogeneous function signatures, numerical aspects of the equation, implicit vs explicit treatment of terms, etc).; The `Simulation` type can then be used to ""run"" simulations over multiple time steps, eg. ```julia; simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.0, end_time=8day, output=output_writers, diagnostics=diagnostics); run!(simulation); ```. and is tasked with managing things like output writing, diagnostics calculation, adaptive time-stepping, and progress logging. Each `Model` then simply needs to define a function that performs a single time-step to interface with `Simulation`. This is discussed further in #447. Such a orthogonalization of the code means we can develop the `Simulation` abstraction without having to worry about updating each `AbstractModel` individually.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580279671:1960,adapt,adaptive,1960,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580279671,1,['adapt'],['adaptive']

Modifiability,"losures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method. This is notoriously tricky, but we've made a lot of progress on this for the purposes of the ClimateMachine and it might be interesting to translate what we've learned into Oceananigans. There's also some minor package stuff that I want to work on, such as refactoring the output writer (#963), improving logging / feedback while oceananigans builds a model or runs a simulation (#1013), getting arrays with named axes to work (#457), and figuring out what's going wrong with models that have `Flat` dimensions (#1024). A more fun project is to come up with cool plotting recipes in 1D, 2D, and 3D (!) We'd like to show people how to use Makie (for example) to create really cool visualizations / animations of turbulence. The examples do some animation, but more complicated stuff (such as 3D contourf plots, or volume rendering) might require dedicated scripts. @navidcy and I have also discussed projects to implement 1) a shallow water model using Oceananigans functionality and 2) a quasi-geostrophic model in Oceananigans (which would use the tridiagonal solver I mentioned earlier).

You can always try with higher order (maybe 7th?) but the higher the order the lower the stability (i.e. at a certain order your implicit dissipation will be so low that you will start to generate grid-scale noise). . The KE dissipation is there with `closure=nothing` and a WENO scheme, it is just not strictly physical: it's (roughly) akin to a 4th to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. You can compare this to using `UpwindBiased(order = 5)` which would give you everywhere a dissipation that converges to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. In general:. $$\partial_x {uu}^{Upwind_N} \sim \partial_x {uu}^{Centered_{N+1}} + \partial_x {K_{numerical}} \partial_x^{N} u$$. where $K_{numerical} \sim \Delta x u$ and $N$ is the order. The nice thing about using WENO instead of a simple Upwind discretization is that the order of the hyperviscosity adapts to the smoothness of the field. Therefore, where the field is noisier (like in regions of higher gradients) the dissipation is more aggressive. . This procedure not only ensures a smooth field but can be thought of as mimicking the subgrid-scale dissipation (which also increases with the gradient of resolved scale variables. As such people have referred to using particularly diffusive advective schemes (such as WENO) as _Implicit_ LES. I like the idea of implicit LES because it allows you to ""fill in"" for the subgrid-scale dissipation without committing to any sophisticated formulation derived in a particularly idealized situation (take the example of Leith derived in homogeneous 2D turbulence and the geostrophic eddies in the ocean), and guarantees (or at least helps) stability. For this reason, it's pretty handy when you have different unresolved processes at different scales that may be characterized by different dissipation characteristics.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433:1749,variab,variables,1749,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433,1,['variab'],['variables']

If the `import` statement is in the module file, then I have to scroll through a screenful of import statements in another file in search of the relevant line. > What is the problem that this change would solve? If one is reading code in a file, and an unfamiliar function appears, one presumably looks to the top-level to see where it is imported. If one is reading a module, why is it crucial to know where in the code the package is used?. It solves two problems: messy module files, and makes it easier to understand where import statements are used. Maybe we do things differently, but I always scroll to the top of the current file to look for import statements. I've never thought to look the module top-level file. Additionally, a list of import statements at the top of the file tell me what to expect in this file. I always skim the import statements before reading a file, although this may be Pythonic behavior haha. > This new convention could create issues in which functionality from a package imported in one file is used elsewhere, making it hard to trace exactly where an unfamiliar function first arrived in the namespace. Or, if two packages conflict with one another. In julia, resolving method conflicts when two packages export the same name can be tricky and the resolution depends on the order in which packages are imported. We can break with convention when needed, but presumably this is the rare exception rather than rule. > I think having more submodules (#495, #456) is really the right solution to this problem; in that case each module is short so the issue of tracing import statements to usage within a huge module is alleviated.

Modifiability,"o the 3D compressible Euler equations. The free-surface SW is a compressible model, which is why we don't have to solve any elliptic problem, and instead we simply integrate the three prognostic equations. . The rigid-lid SW model (which we don't have yet) is different of course. I am sure we can use the existing solves to determine the surface pressure as the hydrostatic model currently does. Here are some thoughts to consider:. 1. Introducing topography is pretty easy but when we do so, we should probably introduce a free-surface. Following the convention of the hydrostatic model seems like the way to proceed. Agreed?; 2. Visosity is not difficult to include but there's a question of which form of viscosity to include. The standard harmonic or biharmonic diffiusivities would be good choices, where they act on the velocities not the transport velocities. If we had a `VectorInvariant` form then I think we could use the current libraries. For the conservative forms, I think we have to adapt them, which will take more effort I suspect.; 3. Note: these forms of viscosity are not strictly positive preserving and they can increase kinetic energy. I know of a form of the harmonic case that is positive preserving and we could include that. But does anyone case about those levels of details? If yes I can include the form in the writeup and even a short derivation of how to get it from the 3D equations.; 4. @glwagner pointed out that `ShallowWaterModel` is very separate from everything else in Oceananigans and that is a bit of a pain to maintain. One advantage of a `VectorInvariant` form is that it could rely heavily on `HydrostaticModel`, that way they grow together. It might even ben an embarassingly simply application.; 5. I would like there to be a switch from free-surface to rigid-lid. In the latter we have to solve an elliptic problem, and again probably easier with a `VectorInvariant` form but probably not difficult with a conservative form either.

Modifiability,"propriately under the hood. For constant `ValueBoundaryCondition` (eg no-slip) or constant `FluxBoundaryCondition`, this is simple --- just copy the boundary condition into every direction. For `FluxBoundaryCondition` we orient the flux along the inward normal (eg positive for `west, south, bottom` and negative for `east, north, top`. This breaks existing convention for fluxes... but we really don't have a choice. We may want to change the convention for the _other_ boundaries eventually. `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` is perhaps the most important case since we'll use this to implement drag boundary conditions. For this I believe we can use the existing infrastructure for `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` (eg we have a way to properly interpolate fields in a manner consistent with the application of drag boundary conditions, etc). It's functionality will have to be extended to accept functions of `i, j, k` (the way it works now is that the ""third"" index (normal to the boundary) is stored inside the object; for immersed boundary conditions we don't need that). `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` won't be very convenient for most people for immersed boundary conditions, but we can treat it the same way we treat constant `Value` or `Flux`. I wasn't planning to implement support for `Gradient` just yet, though this can be done too. Finally, one remaining task is to define or generalize the existing `conditional_flux` so that it adds fluxes only on _immersed_ boundaries. It looks like right now it's too eager and will add fluxes on non-immersed boundaries. Associated with this development I'd like to refactor our naming scheme for the boolean tools we have. Right now these are `solid_node` and `solid_interface`. I'd like to change `solid_node` to `external_node` (ie external to the active domain) and perhaps something like `external_or_boundary_node` for `solid_interface` to represent _both_ nodes that are completely external, or which lie _on_ the boundary.

One could then expand on this design by setting up the `diagnostics` field to accept a list of callable objects or functions. Or even better, a list of objects that look something like. ```julia; struct PrintableDiagnostic{D}; diagnostic :: D; format :: String; name :: String; units :: String; end. function pretty_diagnostic(pd::PrintableDiagnostic, model); return @sprintf(""%s: $(pd.format) %s"", pd.name, pd.diagnostic(model), pd.units); end; ```. with this design, the user can pass a list of `PrintableDiagnostics` to `ProgressPrinter`, which are then evaluated and the results turned into a string via the function `pretty_diagnostic`. As for option 1 of using a logging package, perhaps it could be nice to use some logging functionality that's configurable with global variables (?) rather than manually creating a `ProgressPrinter` that does ""brute force"" printing as I have described above. However I think that it would require some customization of existing logging packages, since the typical `info` or `debug` settings are not sufficient for the purposes of logging simulation output (right?) Instead, we would need more options, and it'd be nice to obtain the ability to also print the output of diagnostics / monitoring functions, as we do in the example script. And I think doing it this way might involve adding some lines to our time stepping loop. Perhaps @ali-ramadhan has more to say. Another thing we have talked about is somehow having the ability to live-update messages in the terminal (rather than printing a stream of message). This would be nice because it could dramatically reduce the text-noise that a stream of messages invokes, allowing the user to much more easily read and interpret the output of a simulation progress (in addition to ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/71#issuecomment-540828221:3265,config,configurable,3265,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/71#issuecomment-540828221,2,"['config', 'variab']","['configurable', 'variables']"

We think this might be simpler (in terms of the code) than passing `immersed_bc` into ` ∂ⱼ_τ₁ⱼ` (where we would throw it away unless we are on `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`.). Another advantage is that we can then isolate the code that calculates flux divergences for `Value` and `Gradient` (eg for no-slip boundary conditions), which could get a little complicated. I'm also trying to figure out if that would cover this case. I think we can use `ContinuousBoundaryCondition` for this kind of drag boundary condition. So in the user script we'd write something like. ```julia; u_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * u * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2); v_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * v * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2); w_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * w * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2). u_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(u_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)); v_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(v_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)); w_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(w_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)). u_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=u_immersed_bc); v_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=v_immersed_bc); w_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=w_immersed_bc); ```. and then under the hood, if we implement fluxes across immersed boundaries correctly, we'll get the right thing? Note the above code assumes that fluxes are along the ""inward facing normal"" --- one of the complications of the user API for this... The corresponding code for no-slip would be. ```julia; u_immersed_bc = ValueBoundaryCondition(0); v_immersed_bc = ValueBoundaryCondition(0); w_immersed_bc = ValueBoundaryCondition(0); ```.

Modifiability,"sonally quite picky about specifying outputs and output file names, so I might always end up with verbose boilerplate for output writing (and I'm personally fine with that). But I'd support reducing boilerplate and maybe just a bit of flexibility would work even for picky people! I remember having this conversation in #1171 actually!. One-line flexible output writing would be especially great for examples, new user friendliness, and quick iteration. Some thoughts:; 1. I think the name `output!` is a bit vague in what it does. Does it just output the current state of the simulation? Would `add_output_writers!` be clearer and align more closely with existing Oceananigans nomenclature? For the same reason, I'd suggest keeping `add_callback!` over renaming to `callback!`.; 2. I frequently output both JLD2 and NetCDF versions of the exact same data. So ideally subsequent calls to `add_output_writers!` with `JLD2Format()` and `NetCDFFormat()` would add both.; 3. Would definitely support extending this to NetCDF as well!. > First, we need to default `with_halos=true` for JLD2OutputWriter. The time has come because `FieldTimeSeries` is mature. We do, in fact, want halos. Sounds good! Will be nice for derivatives to work by default. Although `FieldTimeSeries` could do with a bit more maturing, e.g. issues #3144 and #3750. > The other conundrum is `overwrite_existing` which is discussed on #3543. In short I am wondering whether the best course of action is simply to make default `overwrite_existing=true` and solve so much boilerplate. Is the ""so much boilerplate"" just the extra one line `overwrite_existing = true` for each output writer? Maybe I'm too conservative here but I think the default should be `overwrite_existing = false` just because the cost of overwriting and losing data can be very high. But I really like the suggestions in #3543 of having the option to save output in unique directories be easily specifiable.

Modifiability,"step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact.; > ; > Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time. I'm not sure. > Also wouldn't that also affect simulations with `buoyancy=nothing` if the pre-output time-step were to blame?.

Modifiability,"t place to start to justify changing the `Open` classification. > For example, in a nested case, this would prevent higher resolution eddies from exiting the domain without un-physically modifying the upstream solution. I apologize if this is just a problem with communication style, but I don't think this statement can possibly be correct. The above example seems to demonstrate, for example, that the cylinder wake can be represented well by _either_ making the domain large enough (with sponge layers), _or_ by using a better numerical method with a smaller domain. Basically this allows us to exclude statements like ""we can't model X flow"". The question is not whether or not we can represent the physics of a flow. The question is rather about representing the flow in a domain that is as small as possible / with optimal computational expense. We're pursuing performance optimization. Our language has to take the form ""this scheme allows us to reduce the sponge layer thickness by XX%"", or ""this scheme reduces the width of the near-boundary region where the interior physics are modified"". The statement ""this scheme does not unphysically modify the solution"" makes no sense to me. The presence of the open boundary is unphysical by definition... I personally don't need much convincing that a matching scheme of some kind is needed. I'm just confused about how all of the different pieces that seem to enter into nesting interact with one another --- sponge layers, matching scheme, and also the particular physics of the flow in question (idealized in and outflows vs true nesting). With so many degrees of freedom and complexity I think a systematic approach is absolutely essential. I really hope that the outcome of this work are a set of solid recommendations for nesting (better yet, a recipe that does not have to be changed --- a recommended matching scheme, or a combination of matching scheme and sponge layer) which is supported by unequivocal and rationally presented evidence.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291:2271,layers,layers,2271,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291,1,['layers'],['layers']

Modifiability,"this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model. Here's a simple example:. ```julia; julia> mutable struct Test{T}; a :: T; end. julia> t = Test(1.0); Test{Float64}(1.0). julia> t.a = 2.0; 2.0. julia> t.a = ""hi""; ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type Float64; Closest candidates are:; convert(::Type{T}, ::T) where T<:Number at number.jl:6; convert(::Type{T}, ::Number) where T<:Number at number.jl:7; convert(::Type{T}, ::Base.TwicePrecision) where T<:Number at twiceprecision.jl:250; ...; Stacktrace:; [1] setproperty!(x::Test{Float64}, f::Symbol, v::String); @ Base ./Base.jl:34; [2] top-level scope; @ REPL[6]:1; ```. Here, `t` is `Test{Float64}`. We can change `a` as long as the new value can be converted to `Float64` via `convert(Float64, new_value)`. Otherwise we can't and we just have to write `s = Test(""hi"")` instead. Another possible solution is to build a ""dummy"" closure with the correct type, and then replace it with the ""real"" closure after constructing model by writing `model.closure = real_closure`. It could be fun to try that and see if the code is simpler. I suspect it might not be but it's worth a shot (you might learn something). . > Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. I guess that's sort of what we're doing here.

Modifiability,"thub.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738870593. There may be other problems that we haven't uncovered. An important additional case that doesn't work right now is operations that have embedded `AveragedField`. I think this is some kind of type inference issue. For `Field` on the GPU we ""throw away"" the wrapper and expose the underlying `OffsetArray` to GPU kernels. So compilation of functions of `Field` is ""no more difficult"" than compilation of functions with `OffsetArray`. This idealization is successful because indexing into the underlying `field.data` is identical indexing into the field itself, and because we don't require field locations _inside_ the kernel (we build expression trees for AbstractOperations on the CPU, prior to launching the kernel). But this idealization doesn't hold for `AveragedField` or any `ReducedField`. In particular, abstract operations index into these objects at all `i, j, k`. However, they don't vary on one or more of these directions; the indexing operation needs to be ""collapsed"" so that reduced indices are translated correctly. Thus when we adapt `AveragedField` for the GPU, we hold onto the wrapper:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/98cd4f7a56aa581defc721a01d6e1ab89b534d26/src/Fields/averaged_field.jl#L94-L96. Peeking at the broadcasting code used by julia Base gives a hint. Broadcasting has to solve the same problem: we have to be able to make computations between arrays of size (Nx, Ny, 1) and (Nx, Ny, Nz), for example. In this case, the indices of the first array are ""extruded"" into the third dimension. There are [some shenanigans in `Base.Broadcast`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/e467661f080a1b14ca1a9cf6681a8c713a3ae20c/base/broadcast.jl#L572-L630) that look like they are solving some type instability problem (which would doom GPU compilation for us if it were occurring).

Modifiability,"underlying issue. I think the issue here is that ""entrainment"" should not occur across low stratification regions. Thus this model for ""entrainment"" assumes the stratification is ""strong"". More generally, we are dividing the boundary layer into a convecting region and an entraining region. We identify the convecting region by `N² < 0`. However, in reality the convecting region should extend further down into regions of stable, but still weak stratification below the unstable region. The ""entraining"" layer is more properly where stratification significantly increases over the weakly stratified lower part of the convecting region. (This analysis is based on LES.) `RiBasedVerticalDiffusivity`'s formulation --- apart from being overly simple --- simply cannot cope with the complexity of real boundary layer structure because it is not truly non-local. Really addressing this issue (eg implementing a more physically accurate model of boundary layer structure) might require using a vertical integral instead of a 3D kernel. (We decided that because CATKE seems like a decent parameterization, it's not worth it to pursue those accuracy improvements). One way to fix the issue but retaining a 3D kernel is to change the way we estimate ""convecting"" and ""entraining"" regions. Those criteria are. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/94e99e1d5fb3d121a6d801a931987bb6ff59f20e/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/ri_based_vertical_diffusivity.jl#L247-L248. If we introduce a new parameter, say `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency`, then we can modify this criteria to read. ```julia; convecting = N² < 0 # applies regardless of Qᵇ . N²_entrainment = minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency; entraining = (N²_above < 0) & (N² > N²_entrainment) (Qᵇ > 0); ```. Now the user can determine `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency` to stabilize their model. Probably some default like `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency = 1e-7` would work for Earth-like situations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718:1618,parameteriz,parameterization,1618,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterization']

A two-dimensional turbulent case would be sufficient. > To resolve this PR I could tidy up a simple matching scheme where we compute the mean outflow on the boundary and do a 1D advection for the boundary point, or relax to the external state if there is inflow.

I apologize if this is just a problem with communication style, but I don't think this statement can possibly be correct. The above example seems to demonstrate, for example, that the cylinder wake can be represented well by _either_ making the domain large enough (with sponge layers), _or_ by using a better numerical method with a smaller domain. Basically this allows us to exclude statements like ""we can't model X flow"". The question is not whether or not we can represent the physics of a flow. The question is rather about representing the flow in a domain that is as small as possible / with optimal computational expense. We're pursuing performance optimization. Our language has to take the form ""this scheme allows us to reduce the sponge layer thickness by XX%"", or ""this scheme reduces the width of the near-boundary region where the interior physics are modified"". The statement ""this scheme does not unphysically modify the solution"" makes no sense to me. The presence of the open boundary is unphysical by definition...

Performance," ; > > ; > > But for one layer, WENO vector invariant plus WENO for mass flux may be sufficient, and we don't need any other dissipation (which is nice, less work for us).; > ; > I agree. If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there may not be a need for using explicit dissipation right now, so we might as well do the easy thing and avoid it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226:1624,perform,perform,1624,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226,1,['perform'],['perform']

Should we implement a test to see if our rotation implementations are actually doing what they're supposed to?. For API this is what I suggest:. Three ""modes"":. 1. A ""primitive"" mode whereby fx, fy, fz are all explicitly provided.; 2. A ""general rotation"" mode whereby `rotation_axis` and `rotation_rate` are provided. `fx`, `fy`, and `fz` are then calculated as a convenience.; 3. A ""tangent plane"" mode whereby `latitude` and `rotation_rate` are provided. This mode calculates `rotation_axis` based on `latitude` (and assuming that `y` is north-south). The code might look something like. ```julia; zero_if_nothing(f) = f; zero_if_nothing(::Nothing) = 0. function ConstantBackgroundRotation(FT=Float64; fx=nothing, fy=nothing, fz=nothing, rotation_rate=Ω_Earth, rotation_axis=nothing, latitude=nothing). if latitude !=nothing; isnothing(rotation_axis) && throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify latitude and rotation axis."")); all(isnothing.((fx, fy, fz)) || throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify latitude and (fx, fy, fz)."")); # calculate rotation axis; end. if rotation_axis != nothing; all(isnothing.((fx, fy, fz)) || throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify rotation_axis and (fx, fy, fz)."")); # calculate fx, fy, fz; end. fx, fy, fz = zero_if_nothing.((fx, fy, fz)) # set default fx, fy, fz. return ConstantBackgroundRotation(FT(fx), FT(fy), FT(fz)); end; ```. There's also the possibility of a somewhat minor optimization by keeping the possibility that `fx, fy, fz` might be `nothing`, and eliding the associated Coriolis operations in kernel functions for that case. This requires the struct to accomodate different types for each of them.

Performance,"; > > ; > > ; > > But for one layer, WENO vector invariant plus WENO for mass flux may be sufficient, and we don't need any other dissipation (which is nice, less work for us).; > ; > I agree. If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there may not be a need for using explicit dissipation right now, so we might as well do the easy thing and avoid",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226:1057,perform,perform,1057,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"> @matinraayai is working on making PencilArrays performant. This PR is exploratory and is a fallback that might not be merged if we find an efficient way to do GPU transposes with PencilArrays (requires reducing memory allocations and improving the efficiency of permute operations) and implement r2r Fourier transforms in PencilFFTs. For the moment those two elements are part of this PR.; > ; > This PR follows the (simple) configuration of the 2decomp library https://github.com/2decomp-fft/2decomp-fft, the difference between PencilFFT/PencilArray and this PR (a part bounded domain ffts) is that here (at the moment) we impose the stricter limitation that `Ny` has to be divisible by `Rx` and `Ry` while `Nz` has to be divisible by `Ry`, where `Rx` and `Ry` are the number of ranks (divisions) in the x and y direction. Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either. Something we do not previously support (but which is implemented in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538) was an algorithm that could support any topology with vertically-stretched grids. What is the relationship between this PR and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538, and does this PR support vertically stretched grids?. One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension. Since we almost always would like to use vertically stretched grids (and for various reasons, we may want to also compute the hydrostatic pressure with a vertical integral), ocean LES are typically distributed in x and y.

A lower order, faster WENO scheme may be a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. If that's true, we could use it as the default scheme for models.

Performance,"> I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2*2*5*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who _do_ use codes that rely _heavily_ on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?"" (like I did when I saw the examples). I don't disagree with anything here. I just think users should be able to run using whatever resolution they want and know that the code has been tested and works with weird inefficient resolutions. To encourage users maybe we can print a ""performance warning"" if the grid resolution is not the product of a small number of prime divisors?. > I certainly prefer that.

Performance,"> I think we should distinguish between output we need when we run the model, and output we may eventually provide to the broader community. Ideally, formats for both would be the same, but this may not be the best solution. E.g., netCDF has obvious disadvantages but is still widely used. That does not mean it should be the output format we use by default (although we may want to provide model statistics in netCDF in the end, if a few years from now this is still what everyone uses). So: separate the discussion of what is best for us now from what we should provide (e.g., in any CMIPx archive down the line). Zarr and HDF both seem worth discussing.; > ; > Also important to keep in mind in this discussion: Our workflow will be different from most standard models, which write out instantaneous output that then is post-processed to get statistics etc. We will have to accumulate statistics on the fly, and we can (and should) forgo most instantaneous output, at least for the atmosphere. The model will learn from the accumulated statistics. Otherwise, with instantaneous output, the data volume, especially with embedded LES, will create an I/O and data transfer bottleneck that will limit us, and, e.g., will limit our ability to use distributed computing platforms. I agree. Ideally we'd support different formats (e.g. NetCDF, JLD2, HDF, Zarr, etc.) and have the option to use the best format for your application. We can already switch between output writers and choose which field(s)/diagnostics to output but we only do binary, NetCDF, and JLD for now.

My two cents worth. I think there may be a bug in the setup that produces 100x slowdown. (@tomchor if you supply the whole script, we can investigate.) We've run many successful problems with trig functions. Some recent work by @simone-silvestri suggests we can get 2x speed up for _some_ problems by precomputing grid metrics for the `RegularLatitudeLongitudeGrid` rather than computing them on the fly:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/da9c53ddd9e28d123b40726cfac2fad835284879/src/Operators/spacings_and_areas_and_volumes.jl#L178-L179. But I don't think we've definitely shown that we _always_ will get 2x speed up. Thus we are going to retain the option to compute metrics on the fly in #2025 so we can continue to investigate it. 2x is a long way from 100x though. If used in a boundary conditions, its basically irrelevant whether one uses a trig function or not. Even a forcing function is only evaluated once per grid point compared to 15x (or more?) for a `BackgroundField` velocity component with high-order advection.

Are you producing a lot of 3D time averages (which can't be constructed in post-processing?) We've attempted to design the code so that reductions can be performed with minimal memory allocation. 3D diagnostics can simply be calculated from snapshots of the model state, so there's no need to allocate memory (assuming that static memory greatly exceeds GPU memory, this would be preferred). Are we missing a feature to help reduce memory requirements of diagnostics perhaps?. That's interesting. I'm actually also performing a significant amount of 3D averages, as you picked up on. The reason for that is because I want them at a higher frequency than the 3D snapshots that I'm outputting. I'd need a lot of disk-space to output the 3D fields at such high frequencies, so it's a storage limitation issue.

So the very first thing is that if `eltype` of the array and type of second argument aren't the same then it's converted (the `%2 ...` line); Using `fill!(var, zero(eltype(var)))` then can skip this conversion (it's compiled away) but the result is the same. You can make and educated guess of the type of the zero, but honestly, I wouldn't even bother.

If there's a bug somewhere else, we need a test in that packge (presumably that has been added). . This test also seems a little complicated. Why not just write a simple function that does a broadcast, and then try to autodiff that? Why do we need initial conditions, models, etc?.

When we do that the parallelism issues are identical to the issues with our current CG solver, it's just that tweaking the solver method might allow us to do fewer iterations.

There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2\*2\*5\*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who *do* use codes that rely *heavily* on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?""

The solution you're proposing is simply returning to what we were doing before, right?. Note one immediate advantage: the `nodes` function now works with *any* field (and the implementation is actually less code than before). We lose this feature and must return to dispatching on lots of different cases (as you say, unions), if we fuse the three directions into one type. . However, this becomes even more critical when we think about abstracting operators. When performing an `x` derivative, for example, we know that the field changes location from `{Cell, Y, Z}` to `{Face, Y, Z}`. If the directions were fused, we would have to code each 3D case manually, rather than the 1 (or 2) cases we need with this design. When writing an abstracted interpolation function from an arbitrary location `X1, Y1, Z1` to `X2, Y2, Z2`, it greatly simplifies the task if the directions are ""unfused"".

This means that we don't have to rewrite anything, we just add new functionality for open boundary conditions on top. You could make the point that we have less _new_ code to write though, if we implement a design that allows conditions to be the same. And for users, this could be clearer, so I see the advantage of that. On the flip side, the advantage of making a new `OpenCondition` is that `getbc` retains its meaning as ""the function that returns the boundary condition value"". When we have an external state + matching scheme, the boundary condition values are not exactly the external state and are modified by the matching scheme.

Performance,"@francispoulin ! No worries about the question. I like questions. To answer your latest question --- our nonhydrostatic pressure solver is based on FFTs for regular grids and is therefore quite fast. In simple benchmarks long ago we found that other parts of the algorithm dominated the cost of a time-step. Because of that we aren't sure that having a hydrostatic-only solver would help. Of course, the story is different if we need to stretch the grid in horizontal directions. That said, it would still be interesting to be able to solve hydrostatic-only problems. This would complicate the algorithm a bit because you have to distinguish the barotropic mode, and perform a 2D pressure solve. We already have a function to integrate the buoyancy field to obtain the hydrostatic pressure. For ""things I want worked on"" my wish list falls into three categories: new physics features, new numerics / algorithms, and more boring software / UI work. Here's a couple... 1. Finishing the vertically-stretched grid implementation (numerics). We started work on this but its incomplete. This is a tricky and arduous task but would be quite nice to have... 2. Vertically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics).

Performance,"@tomchor just wanted to echo @ali-ramadhan's thank you for finding that bug!. Right now Oceananigans shines for medium-size LES problems around 256^3, perhaps up to 384^3. For that application I think you may find it is as fast or faster than other codes. On that note, it'd be great to compare performance with other codes for this problem size. . For utterly massive problems like the one reported in the Sullivan paper you've posted, Oceananigans is probably not the right tool right now. We haven't experimented with multi-node parallelism yet, but as @ali-ramadhan suggests, its possible we will start working on either multi-CPU parallelism or multi-GPU parallelism soon. For reproducing the Sullivan paper, you may want multi-CPU parallelism simply because of the sheer number of nodes you'll need. It's worth noting that our AMD turbulence closure *may* be less resolution-dependent than the TKE-based closure used by NCAR LES / Sullivan (and yourself?) and thus it may be possible to run at lower resolution (potentially saving factors of 10-100 in resolution.

Performance,"According to @maleadt on the Julia slack's GPU channel and in regards to the shallow water model profiles:. > Don't focus on time spent in API calls to much. since GPU execution is asynchronous, you'll have to synchronize at some point, and that API call will then 'soak up' time until the stream has finished executing. and here that's literally the synchronize function, which is implemented using cuStreamQuery: https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/blob/2b3ec03ff9774b65541fc88dd6b0f1f7aea5d9e0/lib/cudadrv/stream.jl#L115-L144. >use a timeline profiler (i.e. NSNight Systems) to profile your app, or nvpp if you really want to use the old profiler toolchain. plain nvprof results are too simple once your application hits some level of complexity. >now, it is possible that our CPU-side implementation of synchronize does too many API calls and could be optimized a little, but in the end the call serves to wait until the GPU has finished so it probably doesn't matter much. if it does, e.g. because you want to perform other useful work on another CPU task concurrently, you could try to profile that in isolation and file an issue. Essentially, Tim explains that `cuStreamQuery` takes up more time as the grid size increases because it's called in the synchronize function. The synchronize function as shown in the link above tends to be called more and soaks up more waiting time the bigger the problem hence why it scales positively to grid size. ; Taking a closer look at the shallow water gpu profiling results above, it seems that `cuStreamQuery` takes up a lot of time in the finer resolution runs because it is called many times and not because each call takes a lot of time. For example, in the 16k case, `cuSteamQuery` is called three order of magnitudes more times than `cuLaunchKernel` while both calls are measured in microseconds. ; I'm not sure if `cuStreamQuery` being called 400,000 times is an error with our code, an error with CUDA.jl, not an error at all, or an error with my ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654:856,optimiz,optimized,856,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"After discussing with @ali-ramadhan, it seems more clear that a simple solution is just to use a default halo size of 3. For most models that use the highest order advection scheme we offer this has no effect. For models that use a lower-order advection scheme but don't change the halo size, the memory foot print of the model is ever-so-slightly larger than it needs to be. But this slightly-larger footprint probably isn't noticeable for most problems. So in summary, minimal halo sizes are a minor optimization that has little effect on most problems.

Performance,"Are you proposing a third interface that takes a 3-argument function of `x, L, N`? I think that's fine as a proposal, I just want to be clear about what is being suggested, exactly. What I didn't understand is how one can specify the cell interface locations (call it the ""`z_faces` interface"" --- the one we currently have) without knowing the number of grid points:. > I agree that to define the grid with z_faces we need to know the number of grid points, but that can be done internally. I agree there are other possible interfaces that _do not_ require passing the number of grid points as a parameter; or rather simplify this process by performing calculations under the hood. It could be nice to design types such as `LinearStretching` or `ChebyshevStretching` that provide users with out-of-the-box stretched grids to be used with interface 2 proposed above (call this the ""coordinate map interface""). We can incorporate dispatch on such types (versus on plain functions) in the grid constructor. An example of this being used is. ```julia; grid = VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid(size = (Nx, Ny, Nz), ; x = (0, 2π),; y = (0, 2π),; z = (-1, 1),; z_stretching = ChebyshevStretching()); ```. or, when a parameter is involves such as for hyperbolic stretching, something like. ```julia; grid = VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid(size = (Nx, Ny, Nz), ; x = (0, 2π),; y = (0, 2π),; z = (-1, 1),; z_stretching = HyperbolicStretching(stretching_parameter=1.3)); ```.

Performance,"As discussed via zoom with @kburns, passing a key to computations to be stored and used to determine whether a computation needs to be performed is a simple method that may work for us. A simple option for a key is the current model time, which works for all the time stepping methods we employ and has the additional advantage of interpretability. One complication is that we allow users to specify memory space for `ComputedField`s and `AveragedField`s. As a result, two `ComputedField`s that share memory space may have incorrect `data` if the memory is overwritten. This is, in fact, a problem even in the current code and not dependent on the optimizations discussed in this issue. Since we think it is important to give users the option of avoiding unnecessary memory allocation by managing the allocation of scratch space for computations, we cannot prevent incorrect output resulting from overwriting of scratch space during operations with embedded averaged fields and computed fields. We simply have to document this potential ""gotcha"". We can make avoiding repeated operations a bit safer by requiring users to enable it when a `ComputedField` or `AveragedField` is constructed by a keyword argument, something like `recompute_safely`: . ```julia; U = AveragedField(model.velocities.u, dims=(1, 2), data=scratch, recompute_safely=false); ```. When `recompute_safely` is disabled, the model time at computation will be cached. The cache can either be inside `AveragedField`, or in a global cache.

Performance,"Currently in my workflow, I define an environment variable that contains an string like `$init_$end.nc`, where `init` is the initial time and `end` is the `stop_time` of the simulation.

Useful tips in this regard are; - Try to use higher-order schemes as you need fewer grid points to achieve the same resolution; - Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor the memory usage of the GPU; - Manually define scratch space to be reused in diagnostics, to avoid creating one scratch space for each separate diagnostic you have.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575:385,optimiz,optimize,385,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']

In practice this is really just a performance optimization rather than a physical model (the horizontal drag has no effect on the solution), but it's probably important that we can support it. This low-level, but fully general interface allow advanced users to specify any kind of immersed flux / boundary condition they need to. The next challenge is to design a convenient API that interprets user-input and builds `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` appropriately under the hood. For constant `ValueBoundaryCondition` (eg no-slip) or constant `FluxBoundaryCondition`, this is simple --- just copy the boundary condition into every direction. For `FluxBoundaryCondition` we orient the flux along the inward normal (eg positive for `west, south, bottom` and negative for `east, north, top`. This breaks existing convention for fluxes... but we really don't have a choice. We may want to change the convention for the _other_ boundaries eventually. `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` is perhaps the most important case since we'll use this to implement drag boundary conditions. For this I believe we can use the existing infrastructure for `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` (eg we have a way to properly interpolate fields in a manner consistent with the application of drag boundary conditions, etc). It's functionality will have to be extended to accept functions of `i, j, k` (the way it works now is that the ""third"" index (normal to the boundary) is stored inside the object; for immersed boundary conditions we don'",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100563991:532,perform,performance,532,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100563991,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'performance']"
Performance,"Hey @beta-effect!. Yes as of PR #282 (included in master, but not in v0.8.0), boundary conditions must be specified at `Model` creation time. This is part of an ongoing attempt at making the types we use in Oceananigans more concrete. If we use structs whose types are set once the struct is created (concrete types), then the compile can more easily optimize things as it knows the data type won't change. The default boundary conditions are given by `ModelBoundaryConditions()` where; ```julia; function ModelBoundaryConditions(;; u = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; v = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; w = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; T = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; S = DoublyPeriodicBCs(); ); return ModelBoundaryConditions(u, v, w, T, S); end; ```; so I think what you want instead is something like; ```julia; T_bc = FieldBoundaryConditions(; x = CoordinateBoundaryConditions(; BoundaryCondition(Periodic, nothing),; BoundaryCondition(Periodic, nothing)),; y = CoordinateBoundaryConditions(; BoundaryCondition(Periodic, nothing),; BoundaryCondition(Periodic, nothing)),; z = CoordinateBoundaryConditions(; BoundaryCondition(Flux, 0),; BoundaryCondition(Flux, bottom_flux))). bcs = ModelBoundaryConditions(; u = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; v = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; w = DoublyPeriodicBCs(),; T = T_bc,; S = DoublyPeriodicBCs()); ```. We still need to figure the API a little because this gets a little annoying: you need to compute `bottom_flux` before constructing the `Model` but it's nice to use `xC, yC, zC` to compute `bottom_flux` but we get them from `model.grid`... The easiest thing to do right now might be to just create the model again but with the new `bcs`:; ```julia; # Set up the model and use an artificially high viscosity ν and diffusivity κ.; model = Model(N=(Nx, Ny, Nz), L=(Lx, Ly, Lz), arch=GPU(),; ν=1e-4, κ=1e-4). # Get location of the cell centers in x, y, z and reshape them to easily; # broadcast over them when calculating hot_bubble_perturbation.; xC, yC, zC = model.grid.xC, model.grid.yC, model.grid.zC",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/314#issuecomment-515189875:351,optimiz,optimize,351,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/314#issuecomment-515189875,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']
Performance,"Hey thanks for doing all this! Things look a lot neater. Just have a few comments/thoughts that I'll pepper throughout but should be good to merge!. > A `Model` constructor is now provided in which all important information can be input via keyword arguments. This is great for understanding what the model does, I agree. Would still be nice to keep the ""legacy constructor"" around for when you just want to create a simple `Model` for playing around with or for testing. And it makes for very nice and simple example code. > I also reduced the computational burden of a few of the tests, and changed to factor of 2 resolutions since this makes sense for FFTs (though relatively unimportant for testing, I think should encourage users to use powers of 2 and make a habit of using them ourselves). I would argue against this. While we should try to use powers of 2 for performance, I think that overly restricts the model resolutions we can be running at. There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. Either way, we should always be testing a wide range of grid sizes (and weird grid sizes like `109x77x13`) because the code should work for all of them. If computational cost becomes an issue we should look into paying for extra CI resources rather than reduce testing. > A few more notes:. Might be good to create some new issues based on those just to keep track of what needs to be done. > The examples are outdated.

Performance,"Hi, PencilArrays / PencilFFTs author here. I'd be happy to help solving this issue, and I'd also welcome any ideas that would help improve the PencilArrays interface and docs. I am not familiar with how you define your domain partition. However, from the point of view of PencilFFTs, there is one restriction, which is that the first dimension (`x`) must *not* be decomposed in physical space. This is because FFTs are first performed along this dimension (along which data is contiguous, as usual for Julia arrays). Also, to avoid potential issues, your eigenvalues should be `PencilArray` wrappers. For now, PencilArrays allows broadcasting together `PencilArray`s and regular `Array`s, but I'm thinking this is not a good idea since the behaviour is non-intuitive and can lead to precisely this kind of issue. So I'm thinking about changing the current behaviour in the future -- and improving documentation on this. Finally, when you write:. ```julia; xc = b = solver.storage[2]; ```. you probably mean `xc = solver.storage[3]` (or, equivalently, `last(solver.storage)`, as in [this example](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilFFTs.jl/dev/generated/in-place/#Applying-plans)). `storage[2]` holds an intermediate state that has no ""physical"" meaning, since it has been overwritten by the end of a transform.

Performance,"Hmmm - I am skeptical about that from a computer point of view? In an implicit algorithm and/or radiative transfer alg the next step often depends on the result of the previous steps. . As every CCE graduate student learns, computers take many tens of cycles to evaluate an operation like a an add or multiply. The operation is sequential and carried out in a multi-stage pipeline in the heart of a CPU (or GPU). So unless the compiler has something else for the processor to do, the processor will have to wait for one step to make it through the pipeline before the next step? . I think the normal way to do this is to have some inner horiz blocking that is flexible (and can be 1,1) and then iterate over levels with some intermediate stores? The horiz block can be some fraction of inner cache or GPU local proc shared mem. The math doesn't quite look at this way because it assumes that a+b and/or a*b etc.. happen ""instantaneously"". It does not take into account that the awnser from a*b might take; 5-10 clock cycles to pass through the CPU floating point unit. . I think that is fairly generally true?

I think that once this problem is solved the code may become faster because of the disambiguation this PR lends to the innermost kernels. This problem becomes catastrophic for the closures, which make heavy use of the abstraction. So solving this problem is imperative. We can restore the performance of the default closure by simply pasting the old operators into `constant_diffusivity_closures.jl`. However, I believe the issue with type inference is solvable. .

Since the pressure solver used is experimental (from [this branch](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/glw-xk/divergence-free-immersed-velocity-field)), as a way to assess where the crashing comes from, I suggested using another method to see if the crash would also happen, which would validate or not the experimental pressure solver. @Yixiao-Zhang, optimizing GPU preconditioners is a quite difficult task as demonstrated by the preconditioners slowing down the simulation, and probably not a good use of time of trying to figure out a way to speed up these solvers that we are not sure we want to use. ; Since this simple attempt to have a simulation that runs (with another _correct_ solver) up to the crashing point does not work, I would suggest to just trying to use a (slightly non-correct) FFT pressure solver to see if the simulation still crashes.; If not, then we can assume the crashing occurs due to the PCG solver and try to catch the bug. ; This will probably be a better way to ""optimize"" the solver since we know that the PCG preconditioned with FFT is faster than these other methods.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749:640,optimiz,optimizing,640,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749,2,['optimiz'],"['optimize', 'optimizing']"

I also suggest plotting the divergence to get a handle on how the solver is working. A well-converged solution seems to have isotropically-distributed divergence errors. With looser tolerances, the divergence may be concentrated around the bathymetry (and of course with the naive FFT solver it has a thin layer adjacent to the bathymetry). I also think it would be nice if setting `maxiter=0` had a similar effect as simply using the FFT-based preconditioner.

On the possibility of a NetCDF checkpointer: the first checkpointer design that utilized `restore_from_checkpoint` attempted to serialize as much of a model's data structures as possible. This requirement prevented us from using NetCDF and motivated using JLD2 (there are a few other data formats that can serialize, but JLD2 is fast, simple, and HDF5 compatible, which means it can be loaded from python with `h5py`). However, we now support a simpler paradigm whereby the original run script needs to be modified with `run!(simulation, pickup=true)` in order to ""pick up"" a simulation from a checkpoint. With this simpler design we require only all the prognostic fields and tendencies (for AB2) in the checkpointer file and we could in principle support NetCDF.

This is the basic way to implement a quadratic drag from the interface in this PR. In this case what happens under the hood is that we create 4 `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` for the relevant faces of boundary-adjacent cells (the other 2 faces are normal to the given velocity component, so receive a no-penetration boundary condition). So there could be a type instability compiling all of those (which have been notoriously fickle to compile in the past). We clearly need to hard code quadratic drag though, because for stretched grids and partial cells (and other types of immersed boundaries in the future) we have to do precompute the logarithm of the grid metrics (to use in a Monin-Obukhov-type model) in each direction independently, as well as the logarithm of the roughness. It's too much for this PR though, so I think we should just document how to specify no-slip on immersed boundaries (which appears to be performant), and add a few tests.

If each field now carries around its own boundary conditions and horizontally periodic and channel BCs are treated a grid topology then we can get rid of `HorizontallyPeriodicBCs`, `HorizontallyPeriodicSolutionBCs`, `ChannelBCs`, and `ChannelSolutionBCs` (+ same for triply periodic and boxes) which would greatly simplify model setup and eliminate most overlap between boundary conditions and grid topology. > A `Flat` topology will enable us to set halo sizes to 0 for `Flat` directions, and elide the unnecessary interpolation and differentiation operations in `Flat` directions that currently plagues two and one-dimensional models.

I did that because otherwise it was hard to make the model performant and simulations were taking way too long.

This is common practice for dynamic models since their cost is significantly higher than that of constant Smag or even AMD. With that practice, the dynamic model is taking about 3 times longer to run than the constant Smagorinsky. It does take significantly longer to compile (I haven't timed it). I believe there might be some optimizations still on the table though.; - I also found that the precise value of the Smag coefficient calculated via the dynamic procedure is dependent on the advection scheme, with WENO generally leading to smaller values.

Performance,"Some pretty promising Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks!. Couple of takeaways (all assuming a model with 128^3 grid points and QAB2 time stepping):; 1. **Low overhead**: You can advect up to ~100,000 particles on the CPU and up to ~10,000,000 particles on a (Titan V) GPU before the model slows down by more than 30%.; 2. **Great on GPUs**: Seems that the GPU is great for advecting millions of particles. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this. I'll start refactoring this PR using @glwagner's and @zhenwu0728's feedback, but I think it would be really great if we can keep this performance. # Benchmarks. ```; Oceananigans v0.44.1; Julia Version 1.5.2; Commit 539f3ce943 (2020-09-23 23:17 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-9.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); GPU: TITAN V; ```. ```; Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ N_particles │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 0 │ 361.749 ms │ 364.041 ms │ 364.293 ms │ 368.854 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ 1 │ 375.030 ms │ 376.591 ms │ 377.959 ms │ 385.248 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10 │ 377.251 ms │ 380.792 ms │ 387.560 ms │ 443.325 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100 │ 378.867 ms │ 381.194 ms │ 381.328 ms │ 383.461 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 1000 │ 378.076 ms │ 384.114 ms │ 383.611 ms │ 388.507 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975:919,perform,performance,919,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975,1,['perform'],['performance']

The first case (`N=100`) doesn't look great but it shows that the MPData schemes do not differ very much whether we have 2 or 5 iteractions, and they are somewhere between 1st and 3rd order upwinding. The second case (`N=200`) looks better and I can't really see any difference between 2 and 5 iterations. The third case (`N=400`) has all the schemes performing well, even first order upwinding. Again we can't differentiate between the two MPData schemes and it's even hard to differentiate between 3rd and 5th order upwinding.

If it was up to me I would prefer an extended documentation of GPUifyLoops ;) I only understand how it works by reading what you do with it. . The GPU shared memory is basically a programmable cache while the cache of CPU can't be (easily) controlled. In both cases there is cache so, if you compute multiple partial derivatives of a given (set of) field(s) (d/dx,d/dy, d2/dx2,...) once a block has been fetched in the cache then the memory operations are cheap. Cache is also useful for performing tiny transpositions enabling fast access and vectorized (SIMD) CPU or GPU ops in both X,Y or Z directions. .

Performance,"Thank you for your feedback @maleadt! What is CUDAnative compilation? If you mean the precompilation phase when CUDAnative is first loaded, then it's not that as I start timing after all packages are loaded. I thought 6-7 minutes was normal/expected as @vchuravy et al. reported similar GPU compilation times for their shallow water model: https://github.com/JuliaLabs/ShallowWaterBench. I haven't done any rigorous benchmarking yet but out of those 6 minutes, ~1.5 minutes are spent on compiling code that creates CuFFT plans (the first plan takes 1.5 minutes then the others take <1 second). From watching the log I'm guessing the other 4.5 minutes are evenly split between setting up the model (creating CuArrays, initializing them, etc.) and the first time step (where the kernels are getting compiled presumably). I don't think we have that many kernels (just 5 bigger ones) but one of them; https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2b64d584c79ece0429f2421335ddb6bc0c6c6663/src/time_steppers.jl#L213; has several layers of inlining (it's inlining the majority of the functions in [operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl](https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl)) after which it probably balloons up to be a pretty big kernel. They also have tons of arguments crammed in as the structs I was passing weren't `isbitstype` (working on this #59). I should come back and update this issue once we do some proper benchmarking (note to self: nvprof seems like it's being deprecated in favor of Nsight).

Performance,"Thanks @maleadt, that's very helpful!. In this PR, we haven't directly changed any kernel function signatures. However, this PR does pass more complicated objects into kernels (a wrapper around an `OffsetArray` called a ""`Field`"", rather than simply the `OffsetArray`). The primary changes in this PR are thus 1. _not_ to extract the underlying `OffsetArray` from a `Field`, and 2. writing an `adapt_structure` method for `Field`s. I suppose the translation that's performed by `adapt_structure` increases the number or arguments to the function `ptxcall_calculate_Gu__66`?. The changes made in this PR are not strictly necessary --- they are a convenience. If manually unwrapping `Field`s (the method we previously used) is necessitated by CUDA limitations, I think we can live with that.

Performance,Thanks for running these tests. It would be nice to see how MPData performs in a 2D flow. . It's interesting that tweaking the number of iterations doesn't seem to make much difference. I'm a bit skeptical about this scheme though; it seems pretty diffusive and doesn't even beat third-order upwind which is way simpler. I might have introduced a bug although I went through the code again and it looks correct to me. Another possibility is that the high diffusivity is the trade-off for keeping the scheme positivity-preserving?; Godunov's theorem sets some tough standards -- it's not possible to obtain monotonic advection with a linear scheme beyond first order.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3434#issuecomment-1954700946:67,perform,performs,67,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3434#issuecomment-1954700946,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"That's right. Purely for simplicity we launch all the tendency kernels from 1:N, though for Face-fields in Bounded directions, we only require 2:N. In fact using tendencies only from 2:N could allow an optimization where we don't need to ""enforce"" no-penetration boundary conditions. It'd be hard to achieve this optimization though because users can write things like `parent(u) .= 1` so I'm not sure we can get away with this being guaranteed correct. This has never been a problem because we simply overwrite the boundary velocity and therefore simply discard the tendency at index 1. > The problem is if we try to integrate something like a radiation condition. Can you point me to where in the code this goes down?. > On bounded topology I don't think we ever want to integrate the tendency right? But it might be more complicated to do that. I think that's right that we don't need the tendency. This has been part of the algorithm since time immemorial and back in the mists of time it was indeed more complicated than worthwhile. The complication is that KernelAbstractions assumes indices start at 1... However, we now have a way of offsetting indices in kernels via our `KernelParameters`. So it's not very hard to do this anymore. I can give it a start. If we make this change, we also want to take a step back and look at all the kernels we are launching currently to make sure everything makes sense. For example, here is a question: while we don't want to integrate the velocity tendencies on boundaries, what do we do about diagnostics? Do we want to compute vorticity on the boundary, for example, if we are computing a vorticity diagnostic?

Performance,"The advection-like Coriolis scheme was a non-sequitur because `f` is a very regular field, so upwinding it was just decreasing performance without a significative increase in quality of the simulation. On the other hand, upwinding `u` is very much discouraged because the energy builds up rapidly (by upwinding the velocity the divergence of the reconstructed tangential velocity is not a direct interpolation of the divergence of the original velocity, which is a necessary condition to maintain the algorithm stable). The only thing I can think to increase the order of velocity interpolation in the Coriolis force is to use a centered high-order scheme to interpolate velocity, but that would not help with the noise since a centered scheme is dispersive in nature. . I converted this PR to implement a `WetPointCoriolisScheme` (described in [Numerical boundary layers and spurious residual flows](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC091iC09p10621)). ; This is just a simple addition to an enstrophy conserving scheme where edge (""dry"") points are neglected in the interpolation of the velocity in the tangential direction.

Performance,"The issue is a little tricky. Typically we expect abstract operations to be computed during time-stepping. In that case, the halos should be correctly filled. However, @navidcy expects that abstract operations should be correct at any time and does not expect to have to call fill halo regions. Thus for `compute!` to be more generally useful to users I think we do want this behavior. The problem is that fill halo regions can be expensive eg for distributed models. Therefore to both serve expected user behavior and provide a performant interface we perhaps have to add a flag to `compute!` like `fill_halo_regions=false` so that computation for output does not trigger extra calls to fill halo regions. Note @navidcy you can also use the simpler and more transparent . ```julia; parent(model.velocities.u) .= 1; ```. or just `fill!(model.velocities.u, 1)`. I think your result would be correct then.

Performance,"The problem is not with the reduction but with derivatives that act on reduced fields.; The reductions are not an issue, because by performing a reduction we know what operation leads us to a reduced field, so we can perform the reduction accordingly (for example we exclude immersed cells from reductions). . When performing a derivative we use all three indices regardless of the field being reduced or not. ; In this case we get a funky result where we are trying to evaluate a derivative at `k == 1` for a reduced field that does not necessarily live at `k == 1`. In other words, the assumption that the field lives at `k == 1` is wrong for a reduced field; the right solution, on the other hand, is not so clear cut:. If we assume that reduced fields ""lives"" nowhere in the reduced direction, then we can remove the k index and just perform an ""immersed-boundary-unaware"" derivative. On the other hand, if the reduced field lives on the whole reduced column (like for example an integral) then we need to be aware of the ""immersed column"", because if the whole column is immersed then the derivative should return a zero.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3588#issuecomment-2097124708:132,perform,performing,132,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3588#issuecomment-2097124708,4,['perform'],"['perform', 'performing']"

Performance,"Thinking about this more, I think it would make sense to make an even more radical change. I think we should add `diagnostics`, `output_writers`, and `clock` to `Simulation`. . The `time_step!` function then performs a single time-step, whereas to run a simulation one should write `run!(simulation)`, which handles diagnostics, output writing, adaptive time-stepping, and logging in an integrated way. This orthogonalizes the design a bit: `diagnostics` and `output_writers` are not really aspects of a ""model"", if we use a narrow interpretation of a model as a discrete representation of a physical system. A single physical system might conceivably be associated with a wide range of disparate diagnostics and output, depending on what kind of science is being done. I think scripts become clearer. The user writes. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). simulation = Simulation(model; simulation_parameters...). simulation.diagnostics[:diag] = # something. run!(simulation); ```. As an example to illustrate why `Simulation` is orthogonal to `Model`, here's a possible clear and coherent usage of this separation:. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). set!(model; first_interesting_initial_condition...). first_simulation = Simulation(model, first_simulation_parameters...); first_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_first_simulation; run!(first_simulation). set!(model; second_interesting_initial_condition...) # same physical model, but different starting initial condition... no new memory allocated, no recompilation --- fast. second_simulation = Simulation(model, second_simulation_parameters...); second_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_second_simulation; run!(second_simulation); ```.

Then users could implement this kind of optimization in their script by using an array to represent the forcing, and then by precomputing the forcing into that array using a kernel that only evaluates some subset of all the cells in a callback.

Performance,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`.

Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node.

Performance,"We should close this, but I'd like to leave an explanatory note in case others want to weigh in. This issue is really about ""vision"" than something missing with output writers. This issue really proposes that we think about JLD2 output differently (perhaps, in a way that's similar to how NetCDF views output). In that mode output would be somewhat independent of Oceananigans; if we output ""sliced"" data, then we could also output a ""sliced grid"" that represents the portion of the grid on which the data lives. One might then be able to load data and a grid ""simply"" (ie as `Array`s) and make sense of it without `using Oceananigans`. But since this issue was opened we have implemented `Field.indices` to move towards more full support for ""windowed"" or ""sliced"" fields (not _only_ when writing output), which sends us in a slightly different direction. Now a single output writer can be used to output fields that are differently sliced or windowed. We also support loading sliced fields with `FieldTimeSeries` (which is then able to correctly locate sliced fields on a grid), and doing further computations with those fields (we even envision supporting computations between fields that are sliced differently by computing index ""intersections""). Since we do save index information now when we slice a field, it is actually possible to manually slice a grid after data has been outputted. So savvy users can achieve this functionality with themselves if they (for some reason) are allergic to `FieldTimeSeries`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1194#issuecomment-1115175994:539,load,load,539,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1194#issuecomment-1115175994,2,['load'],"['load', 'loading']"

Performance,"Well, there was a major bug associated with the fact that we were trying to avoid precomputed the diffusivities. Basically, diffusivities cannot be computed on the fly due to the ""predictor-corrector"" algorithm we use for implicit time stepping. Opting to precompute diffusivities solves this problem, at the cost of three additional 3D model fields when using `TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivity`. I think this is not a huge price to pay considering that models with 3 velocities and n tracers have (3 + n) * 3 fields already; thus in the simplest case (one buoyancy tracer and one TKE tracer) we incur ~20% (3/15) additional memory allocation from diffusivity precomputation.

Performance,"Yesterday, @ali-ramadhan and I discussed a new idea for improving the abstraction of equations. The idea is to abstract a `RightHandSide` consisting of a tuple of `Flux`es and `VolumeTerm`s or `SourceTerm`s. Each `Flux` or `VolumeTerm` type would define a `getindex` method, and carry around the references needed to execute that `getindex` method on CPU or GPU. This would greatly simplify the time-stepping routines, which currently involve long function signatures. There'd be no need for 'unpacking', because each term in the equation would perform unpacking upon instantiation. It would also probably be easier for users to extend / add terms to an equation. As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```. We'd have functions that look something like. ```julia; function x_flux_divergence(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); incoming_flux = add_fluxes(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); outgoing_flux = add_fluxes(i+1, j, k, grid, fluxes...); return (incoming_flux - outgoing_flux) * grid.Ax / grid.V; end; ```. ... for example. Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope.

As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`.

Performance,"ed to-do some rewriting of that to unpack like `getbc(bc::BoundaryCondition, ...) = getbc(bc.condition, ...)` and then modify all of the existing `getbc` methods. We can also either i) materialize whatever the user provides into a full boundary condition or ii) build `BoundaryCondition` on the fly inside the kernel (it would get compiled away probably anyways). We don't need to modify the existing `getbc` methods. > For e.g. gradient boundary conditions it feels like the ""boundary condition value"" being the gradient at the boundary has about as much meaning as the boundary condition value for an open boundary condition being the external state and then we do some matching to get the internal solution to approximate it. I agree, I think it's acceptable if the `condition` corresponds to the prescribed external state only, and the halo regions are determined by a calculation that additionally involves a scheme + the internal state. The main difference is where the matching calculation is performed --- either in `getbc`, or in `fill_halo_regions`. I don't think either choice is ""harder"" than the other. The difference and points to consider regard code clarity. That said, I see the advantages of generalizing `Open` rather than adding a new classification. Where does that put us? It looks like this PR has more code than we need (19 files changed?), if all we need to do is generalize `Open`. To generalize `Open`, we should only need to change a few files. Should we close this PR and start over? . I'd suggest starting from the very simple place of showing that one can provide a non-trivial external state, with no ""matching scheme"" (or whatever we want to call it), using a sponge layer. I think having that example will be very useful for demonstrating the advantage of different schemes.

This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU. The basic principle here is that _there is a trade-off_ between precomputing a potentially expensive operation, and performing it on-the-fly. For constants, precomputation is harmless. For arrays, on-the-fly computation has significant benefits, both for code readability and also possibly for performance (in memory-bound computations).

Performance,"in general. We currently handle this only during time-stepping --- there is no guarantee, for example, that the diffusivities or ghost cell values are consistent with the velocity field if the velocity field is set by the function `set!` (in fact, the diffusivities are *always* inconsistent with the current velocity field due to the fact that they are calculated *prior* to taking a time-step). If we want to guarantee such a consistency, we can develop the concept of a model ""state"" and apply it to both ocean and atmospheric models (eg a function `update_state!(model)`, or something similar). What does the jargon ""sounding"" mean?. Merger means we need to think carefully about how to reduce boilerplate to minimize (within reason) the cost of maintaining two parallel models as we develop their shared subcomponents. I wonder if splitting off the output writers and diagnostics into a `Simulation` type that wraps `AbstractModel` may help. In this paradigm, a ""Model"" is reduced to numerics + physics specification. This would be easy to implement (while I think an `Equation` abstraction would be relatively difficult due to myriad difficult design problems, including the abstraction of tuples of terms with heterogeneous function signatures, numerical aspects of the equation, implicit vs explicit treatment of terms, etc).; The `Simulation` type can then be used to ""run"" simulations over multiple time steps, eg. ```julia; simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.0, end_time=8day, output=output_writers, diagnostics=diagnostics); run!(simulation); ```. and is tasked with managing things like output writing, diagnostics calculation, adaptive time-stepping, and progress logging. Each `Model` then simply needs to define a function that performs a single time-step to interface with `Simulation`. This is discussed further in #447.

Performance,"o @maleadt on the Julia slack's GPU channel and in regards to the shallow water model profiles:. > Don't focus on time spent in API calls to much. since GPU execution is asynchronous, you'll have to synchronize at some point, and that API call will then 'soak up' time until the stream has finished executing. and here that's literally the synchronize function, which is implemented using cuStreamQuery: https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/blob/2b3ec03ff9774b65541fc88dd6b0f1f7aea5d9e0/lib/cudadrv/stream.jl#L115-L144. >use a timeline profiler (i.e. NSNight Systems) to profile your app, or nvpp if you really want to use the old profiler toolchain. plain nvprof results are too simple once your application hits some level of complexity. >now, it is possible that our CPU-side implementation of synchronize does too many API calls and could be optimized a little, but in the end the call serves to wait until the GPU has finished so it probably doesn't matter much. if it does, e.g. because you want to perform other useful work on another CPU task concurrently, you could try to profile that in isolation and file an issue. Essentially, Tim explains that `cuStreamQuery` takes up more time as the grid size increases because it's called in the synchronize function. The synchronize function as shown in the link above tends to be called more and soaks up more waiting time the bigger the problem hence why it scales positively to grid size. ; Taking a closer look at the shallow water gpu profiling results above, it seems that `cuStreamQuery` takes up a lot of time in the finer resolution runs because it is called many times and not because each call takes a lot of time. For example, in the 16k case, `cuSteamQuery` is called three order of magnitudes more times than `cuLaunchKernel` while both calls are measured in microseconds. ; I'm not sure if `cuStreamQuery` being called 400,000 times is an error with our code, an error with CUDA.jl, not an error at all, or an error with my profiling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654:1015,perform,perform,1015,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654,2,"['concurren', 'perform']","['concurrently', 'perform']"

Returns an object P which; represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains all of the information needed to compute fft(A, dims) quickly. To apply P to an array A, use P * A; in general, the syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices. (A plan can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the A for which; the plan was created.) You can also apply a plan with a preallocated output array Â by calling mul!(Â, plan, A). (For mul!, however, the input array A must be a complex floating-point; array like the output Â.) You can compute the inverse-transform plan by inv(P) and apply the inverse plan with P \ Â (the inverse plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls to inv or; \), and apply the inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array A with ldiv!(A, P, Â).

Performance,"red buoyancy frequency) should be calculated using the local thermal expansion coefficient and haline contraction coefficient (the analytical derivatives of the equation of state with respect to temperature and salinity at constant depth) --- This is (apparently) a more accurate approximation to the buoyancy gradient than calculating the buoyancy gradient with finite differences of buoyancy at different vertical levels. But this means that all equations of state should define functions that return these coefficients. In addition, we will supply a function to calculated the buoyancy frequency squared (I'm currently calling it `N2`). 3. For Boussinesq equations of state, we do not require the non-static components of pressure as input; instead we use the geopotential depth (corresponding to the use of hydrostatic pressure, `ρ₀ g depth`, to calculate compressive / thermobaric effects on density). At the moment we thus only require `-z` as an input --- though we may need to generalize the buoyancy implementation in the future if for some reason calculating the 'geopoential depth' requires more information (like free surface elevation). Luckily, this is a small change that just requires changing the function arguments to `buoyancy_perturbation`; etc. 4. The name `buoyancy_perturbation` is ok. It is actually potentially confusing, since ""buoyancy"" in ordinary usage is *already* associated explicitly with density anomalies --- rather than static, typically constant or z-dependent components of the density profile. So I think calling this function simply `buoyancy` might be better. On the other hand, we probably want to use `model.buoyancy` to refer to the model field that holds buoyancy-related parameters. Because of that we may want to stick with `buoyancy_perturbation`. Any ideas / alternative suggestions? An alternative is to perform a translation in the kernel functions; aka use `buoyancy_params` in the function signature of kernel(s) that call the function `buoyancy`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/412#issuecomment-532995557:2152,perform,perform,2152,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/412#issuecomment-532995557,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"rtically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method.

Performance,"s (like the models implemented in OceanBioME) to ""opt-in"" to a substepping scheme. In this design, there's no need to change the existing ""slow"" kernels I don't think. However, we could consider changing the name of them. For example, all that's needed is for the _implementation_ to know when to return a slow source term vs fast source term. > this is where I had to make some more changes to the existing code (and probably the messiest part of what I did), because the code often expects the tendencies to live at timestepper.G / $G^-$, so I made functions that dispatched on the timestepper and usually returned that, but for the new timestepepr returned timestepper.physics.G etc. I'm not sure that new tendencies are needed for substepping. The substepping scheme for CATKE manages to avoid allocating any additional tendencies by preserving the ""slow"" source term:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivities/time_step_catke_equation.jl#L167-L171.

Ok, no rush!. Trig functions aren't generically slower on GPUs than CPUs. On CPUs I think our code is fairly non-optimal right now, so various sources of overhead (eg non-optimal threading) can ""hide"" slow operations on the CPU. On the GPU we are more efficient, so overall speed might depend more sensitively on user code when it's injected. (I'd also argue that the beginning of this section is a bit misleading in how it claims we ""try to optimize"" internal source code. In fact, we have performed almost no performance optimization, and this is an important topic for future work.). I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU. The basic principle here is that _there is a trade-off_ between precomputing a potentially expensive operation, and performing it on-the-fly. For constants, precomputation is harmless. For arrays, on-the-fly computation has significant benefits, both for code readability and also possibly for performance",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151:1281,perform,performed,1281,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'performance', 'performed']"

Safety," ; > > ; > > But for one layer, WENO vector invariant plus WENO for mass flux may be sufficient, and we don't need any other dissipation (which is nice, less work for us).; > ; > I agree. If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there may not be a need for using explicit dissipation right now, so we might as well do the easy thing and avoid it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226:2104,avoid,avoid,2104,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226,1,['avoid'],['avoid']
Safety," It's only an opinion piece, so obviously not the objective truth, but I quite agree with it. This passage stuck with me:. > Sometimes the quest for better simulations subordinates even simple physics. About 20 years ago I pointed out that most models of that era neglected to turn dissipated kinetic energy back into heat. For most atmospheric phenomena, this is indeed a small term in the thermodynamic energy budget (though technically required to close any net energy budget), but in strong windstorms like hurricanes, it becomes important. Moreover, no substantial computational benefit accrues from neglecting it. A few weeks later, a researcher came to me to report that he had added this term to his model and found that it made simulated hurricanes too intense, so he took it out again. [...] For this researcher, getting the “right answer” was the goal, even if it is obtained for the wrong reasons. Still today, the conversion of dissipated kinetic energy back into heat remains an optional switch (whose default position is “off”) in a state‐of‐the‐art hurricane prediction model. I'm definitely not accusing anyone of doing this here! But I just wanted to explain a bit where I'm coming from. That said, I agree with @glwagner that maybe we should focus on the more pressing issues at hand:. - 1 - Should Oceananigans keep adding the molecular viscosity as a background to the eddy viscosity? My vote is yes since it's more inline with the physics, which are additive, and we don't gain significant computational efficiency from neglecting it. But that's just my vote. (I also like calling it `ν_total`, as it is unambiguous.); - 2 - What should we do about the numerical implementation docs being out of sync with both the physics docs and the code? I'm happy to change the docs myself, but I think we haven't converged on how to do that yet. I'm okay with nuking one of the docs sections.

Safety,". But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction. But as noted in this PR, this is not enough to fix issues with the immersed boundary MWE... but whether or not that is because of problems with the setup itself, I'm not sure... - All of that said, taking @tomchor suggestion to be more careful in updating the clock for RK3 actually does solve the MWE here. Obviously, this is again addressing the (in principle not entirely solvable) issue of error accumulation in `clock.time`, rather than addressing the other issue with very small time-steps producing an ill-posed pressure correction. I think we should fix RK3 separately, basically because we cannot completely avoid accumulating error in `clock.time`, every little thing we do to make it more accurate is a good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136:2644,avoid,avoid,2644,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"> > Does it have to do with output? Do you know what the time-step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact.; > ; > Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take).

The majority of the new code here deals with the fact that you can't update the boundary condition on wall normal velocities after the pressure correction step and maintain the interior domain to be physical and divergence-free, so we have a new function `_fill_X_open_halo!`, but there is nothing stopping you from also defining new methods for `_fill_west_halo!` which still acts before both the predictor and correct step and is what you would need to write for centre field OBCs. The reason I used `GradientBoundaryCondition(0)` in the validation case is that the literature suggests that it doesn't make much of a difference for the non-wall normal velocity component what boundary condition you use (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1650181006 ""(iii)&plat + Vacp/dn = 0, where V is ‘user-specified’, but cannot be zero, and should be positive if fluid is leaving the domain.

Can you provide a minimum script that reproduces the error? I do think many tracers is an important use case so solving this could warrant reducing the kinds of forcing functions we support --- if that's necessary. I think there also may be solutions that don't change what we support while still solving this problem; eg we provide some features that extend model capabilities specifically for the case of large numbers of tracers. For example, we could avoid passing the tracers explicitly into the kernels. Instead, we can attach references _only_ to the relevant / used fields directly in `Forcing` (we'd have to change the user API to `DiscreteForcing` to support this, but the changes need not be major).

This advection should be less with a smaller spacial step if I remember correctly. Well, I agree that less leakage implies that less tracer is advected across the boundary. But why is less tracer advected across the boundary?. It occurs to me that we are not converging to a particular solution as we refine the grid in this case, because this problem has no viscosity. Perhaps we should do a convergence test for a case with finite viscosity. We do introduce grid-scale gradients in the predictor velocity field via masking, so it does seem possible to me that the leakage / pressure gradient error might scale with resolution. It'd be nice to have a solid mathematical explanation for this behavior. Another question might be whether the leakage / error depends on the extent of the masked region (holding resolution constant).

In this case, the only time we risk overwriting files is when we _re-run_ a simulation from the beginning. Assume for the following discussion that the ""overwriting issue"" is solved for checkpointing:. In my experience, I typically set up a script with `overwrite_existing=true` from the very beginning. This is because when we first write a script, we are prototyping. I have never then gone back and changed `overwrite_existing=false` because of some concern about overwriting data. It's inconvenient, in fact, to set `overwrite_existing=false`. My thought is that it makes more sense to ask people to intentionally request `overwrite_existing=false` in the _rare_ case that this is desired. The key insight is that we spend the vast majority of time prototyping. I would even argue from an economic standpoint that the productivity saved from this setting outweights any rare instances of lost data, if they actually would ever occur due to changing the default.

Do you guys have any idea why that could influence the `fill_halo_bottom`?. If there's a function that can return two possible types (which is inferred to a type `Union` I think) then this might propagate downstream in the compiled code (ie two possible scenarios must be maintained; one when the returned value is `Float64`, and another with different intrinsics for when the returned value is `Int`). I think in principle this can greatly complicate the kernel function for filling the boundary condition. Broadly speaking, for functions that must be inlined into complicated kernels, it's safest to use functions that can only return one type. But I don't have a good answer for why we get the specific error `an illegal memory access was encountered`. This could be a bug in `CUDA.jl`. However, we are using an old version of `CUDA.jl` so there's not much point in raising an issue. The behavior very well may be different in the latest version...

My two cents worth. I think there may be a bug in the setup that produces 100x slowdown. (@tomchor if you supply the whole script, we can investigate.) We've run many successful problems with trig functions. Some recent work by @simone-silvestri suggests we can get 2x speed up for _some_ problems by precomputing grid metrics for the `RegularLatitudeLongitudeGrid` rather than computing them on the fly:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/da9c53ddd9e28d123b40726cfac2fad835284879/src/Operators/spacings_and_areas_and_volumes.jl#L178-L179. But I don't think we've definitely shown that we _always_ will get 2x speed up. Thus we are going to retain the option to compute metrics on the fly in #2025 so we can continue to investigate it. 2x is a long way from 100x though. If used in a boundary conditions, its basically irrelevant whether one uses a trig function or not. Even a forcing function is only evaluated once per grid point compared to 15x (or more?) for a `BackgroundField` velocity component with high-order advection. Some of these thoughts might be distilled into useful advice in this section of the docs.

As far as I can tell when people say they use ""Gent-McWilliams"" they are referring to a constant skew diffusivity (typically 0.3 m^2 / s).

If anything it would have to be `GentMcWilliamsRedi` since we include the symmetric component as well as the skew component.

Safety,"@francispoulin you are correct that a source charge is added to the Poisson RHS to facilitate a solve using eigenfunctions for the homogeneous Neumann problem. The way the source charge is added is very subtle: the source is added by setting the predictor velocity boundary values (typically this means zeroing them out, when the boundary is impermeable):. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/4011a3431144c3a58671e5d827ab39da8fe6e948/src/Models/IncompressibleModels/pressure_correction.jl#L12. This algorithm is very subtle because one can implement it by simply _not updating the predictor velocities_ on boundaries. Changing the wall-normal values of the predictor velocity field modifies the predictor velocity divergence that contributes to the RHS of the pressure Poisson equation. The reason this is an effective source term is because the predictor velocities _do not_ satisfy the same boundary conditions as the physical velocity field (in particular, the predictor velocities have non-zero wall normal components when there is a pressure gradient on the boundary). Thus zeroing out the wall-normal predictor velocities changes the Poisson equation RHS. With some head scratching, it turns out that the modification is precisely what is needed to describe pressure gradients on the boundary. We need to write this up somewhere, not least because there's no clear reference for this algorithm in the literature. We also would like to generalize the algorithm to work for time-varying wall-normal velocities (a separate issue but worth noting here that the current algorithm does not work for this case).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1170#issuecomment-735421171:246,predict,predictor,246,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1170#issuecomment-735421171,7,['predict'],['predictor']

Should we stop aligning time-steps until we are sure that we can do it safely?. @glwagner Sorry I thought I explained the issue in #1280 but looks like I didn't. The problem has to do with checkpointing and pickup when output writers are using `TimeInterval` schedules. Output writer schedules are not checkpointed so when you pickup a simulations that includes output writers with `TimeInterval` schedules, the `model.clock` is restored but the `schedule.previous_actuation_time` is 0 for all `TimeInterval` schedules. So `aligned_time_step` thinks it needs to take a negative time step as it needs to write output at t = `schedule.time_interval`. The permanent fix is to checkpoint and pickup schedules (properly fixing #1280) which would prevent `aligned_time_step` from returning negative time steps. I see this as more of a checkpointing issue than a time step alignment issue.

Safety,"As discussed via zoom with @kburns, passing a key to computations to be stored and used to determine whether a computation needs to be performed is a simple method that may work for us. A simple option for a key is the current model time, which works for all the time stepping methods we employ and has the additional advantage of interpretability. One complication is that we allow users to specify memory space for `ComputedField`s and `AveragedField`s. As a result, two `ComputedField`s that share memory space may have incorrect `data` if the memory is overwritten. This is, in fact, a problem even in the current code and not dependent on the optimizations discussed in this issue. Since we think it is important to give users the option of avoiding unnecessary memory allocation by managing the allocation of scratch space for computations, we cannot prevent incorrect output resulting from overwriting of scratch space during operations with embedded averaged fields and computed fields. We simply have to document this potential ""gotcha"". We can make avoiding repeated operations a bit safer by requiring users to enable it when a `ComputedField` or `AveragedField` is constructed by a keyword argument, something like `recompute_safely`: . ```julia; U = AveragedField(model.velocities.u, dims=(1, 2), data=scratch, recompute_safely=false); ```. When `recompute_safely` is disabled, the model time at computation will be cached. The cache can either be inside `AveragedField`, or in a global cache.

Safety,"Hi both, Thanks for the quick replies on this. I agree that it seems like it is likely coming from the background gradient and lack of periodicity when applied to the hydrostatic presssure. As far as I can tell there aren't any problems for passive scalars which supports that interpretation. As an aside, I think that there are also boundary artifacts in the internal_wave.jl example (although you need to run the simulation longer and you can't see them with the default contouring of the plots). . A solution that should work is to implicitly cancel the hydrostatic pressure gradient associated with the background field with the buoyancy term. This is what we do in Diablo (although we don't decompose the pressure into hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic components). Implementing this is simple since you just don't include the background gradient when calculating the hydrostatic pressure. The only trouble that I see is figuring out when to do this. In other contexts you want to keep this term. E.g. in the geostrophic adjustment problem, the hydrostatic pressure gradient is needed to drive the flow. Maybe it would be safe to exclude the background buoyancy field in the calculation of the hydrostatic pressure anytime when the topology is periodic in the vertical direction?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3364#issuecomment-1783557267:1124,safe,safe,1124,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3364#issuecomment-1783557267,1,['safe'],['safe']
Safety,"Hi, PencilArrays / PencilFFTs author here. I'd be happy to help solving this issue, and I'd also welcome any ideas that would help improve the PencilArrays interface and docs. I am not familiar with how you define your domain partition. However, from the point of view of PencilFFTs, there is one restriction, which is that the first dimension (`x`) must *not* be decomposed in physical space. This is because FFTs are first performed along this dimension (along which data is contiguous, as usual for Julia arrays). Also, to avoid potential issues, your eigenvalues should be `PencilArray` wrappers. For now, PencilArrays allows broadcasting together `PencilArray`s and regular `Array`s, but I'm thinking this is not a good idea since the behaviour is non-intuitive and can lead to precisely this kind of issue. So I'm thinking about changing the current behaviour in the future -- and improving documentation on this. Finally, when you write:. ```julia; xc = b = solver.storage[2]; ```. you probably mean `xc = solver.storage[3]` (or, equivalently, `last(solver.storage)`, as in [this example](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilFFTs.jl/dev/generated/in-place/#Applying-plans)). `storage[2]` holds an intermediate state that has no ""physical"" meaning, since it has been overwritten by the end of a transform.

One simple possibility that might involve minimal code modifications is to add an order of approximation annotation to `RegularCartesianGrid`. We can then define ""nth-order"" interpolation and differencing operators with special notation (something like `δⁿxᶠᵃᵃ`) that types can opt into, such as `IsotropicDiffusivity` or the pressure term for `ShallowWaterModel`. The primary application for incompressible models is diffusion operators, I think. I'm not sure about high-order interpolation for other physics, such as Coriolis forces, etc. Using `grid` might avoid the complexity associated with specifying an ""order of approximation"" for each aspect of the physics separately. I guess we already separate out advection (we could in principle come up with default advection schemes associated with grid's order of approximation...)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-741499554:1085,avoid,avoid,1085,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-741499554,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"I think the problem comes from the fact that you build the advection scheme _outside_ the model with `WENO(grid)` but the grid changes inside the model and this change is not recorded in the advection scheme. . What do you think about just spitting out an error then? In that way the user is forced to rebuild the grid and any error which derives from inconsistencies between model grid and preliminary grid is solved. . We can always regularize the advection scheme _inside_ the model (as I am already planning to do, and will do in #2642) and that will clear the error with advection. . The downside of inflating the grid inside the model is that we always have to make sure that _anything_ that we build outside the model is regularized when inflating the halos (functions, auxiliary fields, viscosity functions, etc). This might be a little bit unsustainable. . For this reason, I am in favour of just spitting out an error, which might be a little bit inconvenient for the user (not extremely though) but is much safer. .

Safety,"It's because on an immersed boundary grid, reduced operations are wrapped in `ConditionalOperation` in order to mask the reduction --- and `ConditionalOperation` had a bug; namely it was missing a definition of `compute_at!` (which all the other abstract operations have, eg `BinaryOperation`). For `compute!` on a reduction to be correct, we first have to compute all of the fields that are involved in the reduction. To make this work, we call `compute_at!` on `reduction.operand`. This in turn has to trigger the computation of _any_ fields that are in the expression tree associated with `reduction.operand`. Thus all `AbstractOperations` with field operands must define `compute_at!`. The difference between `compute_at!` and `compute!` is that `compute_at!` has a ""time"" associated with it.

Here's a few thoughts:. - Reading about [Kahan summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm) makes it clear that we simply cannot avoid errors if we would like to add a small floating point number (the time step) to a very large number (the model time). . - I think the issue with the time-step is whether or not we can compute the RHS of the pressure Poisson equation accurately --- which is `div(u') / Δt`, where `u' = u + Δt * Gu` is the predictor velocity and `div` is the divergence. This is interesting, because I could not figure out why we would ever find large `div(u')` with small `Δt` even in this MWE. But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think.

This might be convenient if you've carefully designed your vertical coordinate to get the spacings ""right"" at the bottom of the domain, but care a lot less about what happens higher up. Then if you get more computational power, you can increase Nz (decreasing the dependence of the stuff lower down on your ""sponge region"").

I think this is not a huge price to pay considering that models with 3 velocities and n tracers have (3 + n) * 3 fields already; thus in the simplest case (one buoyancy tracer and one TKE tracer) we incur ~20% (3/15) additional memory allocation from diffusivity precomputation.

In this problem, the buoyancy is decomposed ($b=\bar{b} + b^{\prime}$) into a background component $\bar{b} = N^{2} \hat{z}$ (where $\hat{z}$ is positive in the direction opposite the gravitational vector) and the remaining perturbation. The current example script applies no boundary conditions to the perturbation buoyancy, which I believe defaults to a no-normal-flux condition at the top and bottom boundary. Because no boundary conditions are applied to the background field, there is an implied diffusive flux $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (-\kappa \nabla \bar{b}) = ±\kappa N^{2} \cos{\theta}$ across these boundaries. This means that the boundary condition on the total buoyancy is a non-zero flux across the seafloor, which does not make much sense for this problem. The normal way of implementing this problem is to apply a gradient boundary condition, $\frac{\partial b^{\prime}}{\partial z} = -N^{2}\cos{\theta}$, at the bottom, to impose the no-flux condition. (In my MITgcm configurations, I verified that implementing the boundary condition this way recovered the classical analytical solutions of [Garrett et al. 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.fl.25.010193.001451).

Safety,"e would like to add a small floating point number (the time step) to a very large number (the model time). . - I think the issue with the time-step is whether or not we can compute the RHS of the pressure Poisson equation accurately --- which is `div(u') / Δt`, where `u' = u + Δt * Gu` is the predictor velocity and `div` is the divergence. This is interesting, because I could not figure out why we would ever find large `div(u')` with small `Δt` even in this MWE. But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction.

If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates.

One downside of this method is that it precludes `VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization()`: because we use a predictor-corrector method for implicit time discretization, diffusivities that are treated implicitly _must_ be precomputed. ## Subtleties. There's more. There are subtleties peculiar to using `Ri` in a closure, because `Ri` easily becomes NaN when both the buoyancy gradient and shear are zero. The usual solution to this for ocean modeling is to use the ""hack"" that 0/0 = 0. In other words, NaNs are intercepted and set to 0. There are again a few solutions to this. One is simply to set all `NaN` to zero in side the function that computes `Ri`, eg. ```julia; u, v, w = model.velocities; b = model.tracers.b; Ri_op = @at (Center, Center, Center) ∂z(b) / (∂z(u)^2 + ∂z(v)^2).

I couldn't figure out how to pass in the array to be indexed so that it can fit in the `Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, i, j, k)` signature and be available for the user to fill. Where in the model should we store the forcing array in this case?. Hmmm, actually we could make the function accept the forcing struct, e.g.; ```julia; Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, forcing, i, j, k); ```; but then we'd have to have arrays in the forcing struct, e.g.; ```julia; struct Forcing{Tu,Tv,Tw,TT,TS,TA<:AbstractArray}; u::Tu; v::Tv; w::Tw; T::TT; S::TS; u_arr::TA; v_arr::TA; w_arr::TA; T_arr::TA; S_arr::TA; end; ```; and then the forcing function is just; ```julia; Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, forcing, i, j, k) = forcing.u_arr[i, j, k]; ```. Either we have 5 array types so fields with an actual forcing function get `nothing` for the array or we have 1 array type `TA` and set the arrays for forcings with a function to something like `Array{Float64}(undef, 0)`.

When the PR is polluted with random other stuff that valuable use is lost. Most git projects more diligent about avoiding polluted PRs, which can be useful.

This is where we ended up in MITgcm and is similar to what is in MPIStateArray in the DG work (I am fairly sure!). A distinction to maybe think about is a set of halo() functions that just do the stuff that does not appear in any of the equations. Anything in equations turns out to be stuff that people may want to tinker with in surprisingly interesting ways. For example someone ultimately might want to do a numerical experiment that has flux BC on some set of the one bit of a boundary, something else on another bit etc.... (people do do things like this). For better or worse having bc's better separated from halos may ultimately prove the right thing. For now I wouldn't worry about it though!. Related to 2.

Safety,"step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact.; > ; > Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time.

Safety,"that we need different Coriolis functions for Cartesian and Spherical coordinates. Why do we need different functions or nonhydrostatic (and shallow water I presumme) and hydrostatic?; > ; > I'm also not clear, although I'm assuming that it has to do with `w` being treated differently (since `w` appears in the equations for the horizontal rotation components). @glwagner can you clarify?. Yes, when we make the hydrostatic approximation, we assume that the aspect ratio is thin and H/L is small. The hydrostatic assumption specifically refers to the use of this scaling in the vertical momentum equation (reducing it to a diagnostic equation for hydrostatic pressure). This same scaling applied to the Coriolis force leads to the ""traditional"" approximation such that Coriolis terms involving the _vertical_ velocity are neglected from the horizontal momentum equations (likewise, the terms involving the horizontal momentum are neglected from the vertical momentum balance; neglecting these terms must be made consistently for the system to conserve kinetic energy). This thin-aspect-ratio approximation (probably best to avoid implicating ""tradition"" in model formulation...) also needs to be invoked to justify ""f-plane"" and ""beta-plane"" approximations to the Coriolis term when the numerical model is supposed to approximate oceanic motion away from the poles. (The so-called ""non-traditional"" terms --- the projection of the planetary vorticity into horizontal directions --- have been variously found to have a small effect on turbulent boundary layer motions. This is probably because the effect of Coriolis forces is most pronounced at the largest scales, and the effect of the horizontal Coriolis components on large scale vertical motions is suppressed by the presence of an impenetrable surface at the top and bottom.).

Safety,"ur talk:. ### Option 1. First option is we keep calling the directions `Vertical` and `Horizontal`, since those names are pretty intuitive and play well with already-defined terms like `VerticallyImplicit` (which are also intuitive and widely used in the literature). The downside to this option, if we were to follow (2), appears as an inconsistency whenever we tilt the domain and need to use `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=ĝ)` (`ĝ` being a unit vector). So we could end up with a case where the vertical direction is implicitly defined as being tilted 45 degrees (by means of `Buoyancy`), but for `ScalarDiffusivity` `Vertical` will still mean the `z` direction, which is confusing. Furthermore, the default option for buoyancy would be called `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=Vertical())`, which is not helpful. ### Option 2. Second option is to change the notation to what I proposed here: `XYDirection` etc., which avoids this inconsistency. The downside is that it doesn't play well with terms like `VerticallyImplicit` anymore. Something we either would have to live with, or we'd need to change those terms as well (something like `ZImplicit` isn't wrong, but it's not what people generally call it). ### Option 3. We could also keep the names `Vertical` etc., but change the interface of `Buoyancy` so that it doesn't implicitly define that the vertical direction is. So instead of having the interface be. `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=ĝ)`. it would be something like. `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), direction_antiparallel_to_gravity=ĝ)`. which is equally correct and doesn't assume that ""vertical"" is connected to the direction of gravity. The issue here is that the name `direction_antiparallel_to_gravity` is super long. ### Option 4. @simone-silvestri raised an interesting point that these aren't just ""directions"" they are also different formulations.

Instead, we can design an interface that allows biogeochemical models (like the models implemented in OceanBioME) to ""opt-in"" to a substepping scheme. In this design, there's no need to change the existing ""slow"" kernels I don't think. However, we could consider changing the name of them. For example, all that's needed is for the _implementation_ to know when to return a slow source term vs fast source term. > this is where I had to make some more changes to the existing code (and probably the messiest part of what I did), because the code often expects the tendencies to live at timestepper.G / $G^-$, so I made functions that dispatched on the timestepper and usually returned that, but for the new timestepepr returned timestepper.physics.G etc. I'm not sure that new tendencies are needed for substepping.

PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z).

I see you used `GradientBoundaryCondition(0)` in your validation codes but, for example, for buoyancy that's not gonna cut it and will lead to reflections. The majority of the new code here deals with the fact that you can't update the boundary condition on wall normal velocities after the pressure correction step and maintain the interior domain to be physical and divergence-free, so we have a new function `_fill_X_open_halo!`, but there is nothing stopping you from also defining new methods for `_fill_west_halo!` which still acts before both the predictor and correct step and is what you would need to write for centre field OBCs. The reason I used `GradientBoundaryCondition(0)` in the validation case is that the literature suggests that it doesn't make much of a difference for the non-wall normal velocity component what boundary condition you use (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1650181006 ""(iii)&plat + Vacp/dn = 0, where V is ‘user-specified’, but cannot be zero, and should be positive if fluid is leaving the domain.

I often find myself spending way longer on PRs than I initially anticipate so I'm generally not very good at assessing these things lol. ok ok! Here's a rule of thumb: a bugfix or refactor is the least committment, because you can get away with no new tests or docs. A new _feature_ takes more time because of documentation. One should expect to spend most of their time on docs and tests. If you're spending a lot of time implementing a feature, then either the feature is very complicated / hard, or your workflow can use some improvement. Among new features, different types of features require different amount of effort. This case is one of the easier cases --- it's extending functionality without changing existing functionality, also its fairly niche (at this point) so simple documentation will suffice. The work required to test the feature also has already been partially completed (the script you posted). Other features, like adding new _physics_ will take much longer, because often you'll have to run a full validation case + analysis to assess whether things work as expected. So even if the source code change is small to implement new physics, the validation will take a while and dominate the development effort. If a new feature also requires changing existing functionality / refactoring, that's going to take the most amount of time, because you will probably also have to change existing tests.

Do you guys have any idea why that could influence the `fill_halo_bottom`?. If there's a function that can return two possible types (which is inferred to a type `Union` I think) then this might propagate downstream in the compiled code (ie two possible scenarios must be maintained; one when the returned value is `Float64`, and another with different intrinsics for when the returned value is `Int`). I think in principle this can greatly complicate the kernel function for filling the boundary condition. Broadly speaking, for functions that must be inlined into complicated kernels, it's safest to use functions that can only return one type. But I don't have a good answer for why we get the specific error `an illegal memory access was encountered`. This could be a bug in `CUDA.jl`. However, we are using an old version of `CUDA.jl` so there's not much point in raising an issue. The behavior very well may be different in the latest version...

I propose that in order to move forward, we should generate a few additional validation tests including some with bathymetry.

Maybe a topographic Rossby wave or some such would help build confidence that we are treating non-uniform bathymetry correctly with both of the formulations that we have. Thanks for the explanation. I agree that looking at a topographic Rossby wave is a good test to have. In the case of a small linear slope and small amplitude wave, it should be close to an exact solution so that will be easy. If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography.

Security,"Here's a few idea:. 1. Write more constructors for `BoundaryCondition`. The simplest constructor is what we often use, when the boundary condition is a constant or array. But we should add more constructors that support specifying boundary condition parameters. We should assume that by default the user wants to use `BoundaryFunction`, rather than the current default assumption that the function being specified is low-level. We can have a public constructor for `BoundaryCondition` that takes the argument parameters, which is designed to work with what we currently call ""`BoundaryFunction`"". 2. Add support for a lower-level, non-default boundary condition function signature (the current default) that gives the user access to more of the model state, should they need it. 3. Never ask the user to tell `BoundaryCondition` what field / boundary is being used. Instead, add interpretation to `TracerBoundaryConditions`, `UVelocityBoundaryConditions`, etc that rebuilds the boundary conditions objects as needed. Use defaults in the `BoundaryCondition` constructor as temporary placeholders, and rewrap as needed in `TracerBoundaryConditions`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/769#issuecomment-645519660:723,access,access,723,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/769#issuecomment-645519660,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"Hmm. I think given general `u, v` we need to solve an elliptic equation to find `psi`, eg `lap(psi) = dx v - dy u`. Then the geostrophic buoyancy field is `b = f * dz(psi)`. For some boundary conditions or assumptions of homogeneity, we can possibly simplify this procedure. One could in principle use the conjugate gradient solver to write a fully general utility, though. Hopefully this task will be taken up once the hydrostatic model is operational. Some care must be taken with the geostrophic mode / computation of the geostrophic free surface displacement for the hydrostatic model. Or, given a geostrophic buoyancy field we can integrate in `z` (eg summation of `b * dz`). This would be the intent of `IntegratedField`, but nobody has implemented that yet. Absent those techniques I think the best method for idealized problems is to use a geostrophic streamfunction. This is illustrated by the Eady turbulence example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/0153dec98e58b7819ae8e1d57516fc7994694762/examples/eady_turbulence.jl#L38-L41. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/0153dec98e58b7819ae8e1d57516fc7994694762/examples/eady_turbulence.jl#L151-L152.

Since the pressure solver used is experimental (from [this branch](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/glw-xk/divergence-free-immersed-velocity-field)), as a way to assess where the crashing comes from, I suggested using another method to see if the crash would also happen, which would validate or not the experimental pressure solver. @Yixiao-Zhang, optimizing GPU preconditioners is a quite difficult task as demonstrated by the preconditioners slowing down the simulation, and probably not a good use of time of trying to figure out a way to speed up these solvers that we are not sure we want to use. ; Since this simple attempt to have a simulation that runs (with another _correct_ solver) up to the crashing point does not work, I would suggest to just trying to use a (slightly non-correct) FFT pressure solver to see if the simulation still crashes.; If not, then we can assume the crashing occurs due to the PCG solver and try to catch the bug. ; This will probably be a better way to ""optimize"" the solver since we know that the PCG preconditioned with FFT is faster than these other methods.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749:575,validat,validate,575,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749,1,['validat'],['validate']

Security,"I don't think I understand how this is ill-posed? It is over specified so will not produce physical results but I thought that without a radiating condition this should still not NaN straight away there should just be a lot of reflections from the boundaries?. Here is a simplified version of my code: https://github.com/jagoosw/OpenBoundaries.jl/blob/main/validation/bug_mwe.jl. I am using a matching scheme that advects the perturbation component (defined as the boundary adjacent minus imposed velocity) out of the domain, and relaxes to the imposed velocity at different rates depending on if it is an inflow or outflow (for the v component the timescale is Inf for outflows to allow it to maximally transmit information out). I can run it with no matching scheme but it needs tiny timesteps because the noise at the boundaries becomes massive. When I use the default pressure solver it kind of works. There are some bugs, for example, there is this weird jet generation on the southern inflowing boundary. I think these would be solved with relaxing regions. . https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85e66e2-3da7-402a-b546-57a3860cef9c.

I think there is also an issue with my model that its not respecting when a boundary adjacent cell is immersed so I'll fix that and get back to you.

Security,"I just thought I'd drop by with my point of view as user and (for now) not a developer. Talking with other people who have tried Oceananigans, the most important thing from our point of view may be the MPI parallelism. I know there is some debate to be had in this topic (I've had a couple discussions with @glwagner myself), but for now my understanding is that it's much easier to have access to CPUs then GPUs. Also if I understand correctly that would allow the model to be run on multiple GPUs, which will allow for some really big simulations resolving a huge array of scales. I bet there's new physics to be found there among the nonlinear interactions between all these scales!. From my point of view (now without talking to other users) #1241 seems like a pretty big issue. It's hard to use Oceananigans if you're not sure you're going to be able to calculate the statistics you need to do your science straightforwardly. For what I want right now it seems like I can use `LESbrary.jl`, but that might not always be the case. I'd definitely put that in the list of issues to be resolved asap. From a user perspective I think #890 is also important. I've suffered the consequences of lack of attention to BCs already and it'd be nice to have the model check those for me. I also think #471 would be nice to have. I agree with @navidcy that it's not a deal breaker, but it would save computation and (if I understand correctly) all the hard work for that has been done already, no?.

Security,"I started tackling this issue in ClimaAtmos last week. I wrote a module, `OutputPathGenerator`, in a separate utilities package ([documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaUtilities.jl/dev/outputpathgenerator/)). This module defines an object, `OutputPathGenerator` that can be extended with different `OutputPathGeneratorStyle`s. ; The `OutputPathGenerator` is used in a `generate_output_path` function that takes the base output dir and the style.; The simplest of such styles is ""overwrite"". . The style that is currently being used in Atmos is `ActiveLinkStyle`. Citing from the docs:; > This style provides a more convenient and non-destructive approach. It manages a sequence of subfolders within the base directory specified by `output_path`. It also creates a symbolic link named `output_active` that points to the current active subfolder. This allows you to easily access the latest simulation results with a predictable path. > Example:; > Let's assume your output_path is set to data.; > If data doesn't exist, the module creates it and returns data/output_active. This link points to the newly created subfolder data/output_0000.; > If data exists and contains an output_active link pointing to data/output_0005, the module creates a new subfolder data/output_0006 and updates output_active to point to it.; > If data exists with or without an output_active link, the module checks for existing subfolders named data/output_XXXX (with XXXX a number). If none are found, it creates data/output_0000 and a link data/output_active pointing to it. Atmos uses `OutputPathGenerator` internally. My vision is that end users would be providing the base path and possibly choosing a `Style` if they don't want the default behavior (which is the ActiveLinkStyle). `Styles` are Julia objects and new ones can be defined in scripts by implementing a method for the function `generate_output_path`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662:877,access,access,877,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"I wrote some validation scripts and I think the model is working, but I'd appreciate some feedback. First, this animation shows two 3D decaying turbulence simulations, one with `SmagorinskyLilly` and another with the `ScaleInvSmag`. I'm also plotting the value of the Smagorinsky constant from the dynamic model. For similar conditions (3D homogeneous tubrulence), Lilly assumed a sharp spectral filter in the inertial subrange, matched the SGS dissipation rate to the TKE dissipation rate and obtained the theoretical value of the Smag constant of $c_s$ ≈ 0.165. I think these assumptions should be roughly valid in this validation script, and indeed the value that we obtain for $c_s$ is kinda close:. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f210d18b-82bf-4e9e-bb26-58bbd4251820. Although to be honest I expected the value to be closer. That said, I believe Lilly also assumed a _stationary_ turbulent flow (although I'd have to double check that), which is not the case here and may be affecting the coefficient value. Btw, I had posted a similar video before but I made some modifications to the model since then. I also reproduced the first test simulation in the original Bou-Zeid (2005) paper: namely a channel flow forced by a pressure gradient, with a Monin-Obukhov-compliant bottom drag. I couldn't reproduce the simulation perfectly (for example, they use a pseudo-spectral scheme in the horizontal directions, force their drag with a horizontal average, and modify the `SmagLilly` constant slightly) so the results are a bit different from what's in their paper, but I think that's okay. Let me know if anyone thinks otherwise. Importantly, the `ScaleInvSmag` shows an improvement over the `SmagLilly`, with the later being expectedly overly diffusive and pretty much killing any turbulence at this resolution:. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6440450d-52f4-43ef-9ad5-0f8fcd9993d5.

Security,"Let's review what we want to support here:. 1. `user_output` is an AbstractOperation or a Reduction. Therefore it has no indices, and we can allocate only the data we need for output. Easy and supported prior to this PR.; 2. `user_output` is pre-allocated `Field` with full indices. We compute the output indices given `user_indices` and `with_halo` (this is what we supported previously), and then construct a `view(field, indices...)`. Supported prior to this PR.; 3. `user_output` is a pre-allocated `Field` with _non-default indices_. This case is tricker, because there are several possible scenarios:; - `user_output` is a view over a full field (aka `WindowedField`). In this case, we can in principle re-index at will, since we have access to the full underlying data.; - `user_output` is a ""partial field"" with data that covers only part of the grid. In this case, not all indices are valid. We don't have any infrastructure for constructing views into ""partial fields"" in the code right now. This is probably the source of the error we are seeing. I guess the simplest solution is just to ignore ""output writer indices"" for fields that have non-default indices. And this is the first solution discussed on this PR... but then we can't respect the argument `with_halos`. To respect `with_halos` it looks to me like we need more infrastructure for calculating index intersections. For example, we have to be able to deduce that a field with already-chopped halos should not have their indices ""re-chopped"". `parent_index_range` as written knows nothing about ""partial fields"" with non-standard parent indices.; It's certainly possible to support this and probably just a little careful arithmetic to get it right.

Currently our models are fairly simple, but its challenging to place bounds on potential future complexity. For example, models in the future may require additional fields associated with closures or parameterizations, such as boundary layer depth fields, in-plume tracer concentrations and vertical momentum, precomputed mixing length fields, and perhaps other auxiliary fields associated with various prognostic / diagnostic LES models. We probably can't plan to support setting boundary conditions on every possible field via the model constructor. With our current design we have essentially special-cased turbulent diffusivities because our focus is LES, turbulent diffusivities are relatively common, and it convenient for us.

Security,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations.

Security,"Okay, apologies. I just didn't quite understand what you meant when you said they _seem_ identical. Typically we would just write something like `T1 == T2`, which will return `true` or `false`, or equivalently something like `all(T1 .== T2)`. Another test is to use `isapprox` (also written `≈`) as in `all(T1 .≈ T2)`. Here's a bit more background on the reproducibility tests we currently have:. We have [""regression tests""](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/test/regression_tests) that test to ensure that output from a certain simulation remains identical across PRs, including tests that involve LES closures. These tests involve ~10 time steps. We conclude that results are ""identical"" when every grid point is within `sqrt(eps(T))`, where `T` is the floating point type (eg `Float64` or `Float32`), for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fc84215f76661e9f1cfb103dc18f86442cec9d89/test/regression_tests/hydrostatic_free_turbulence_regression_test.jl#L112. Many of our other tests also implicitly rely on reproducibility. I think, therefore, that we do have reproduciblity in many cases. However, it is quite possible that your case exposes some particular feature that leads to a loss of reprodicibility. I think perhaps the next step in order to make progress is to code up a ""minimal working example"" (often called an MWE), which involves relentlessly simplifying the examle until we isolate the essential complication that leads to a failure of the test. With that knowledge in hand, we can dig deeper to find the underlying cause (and hopefully fix it). Often, the process of simplying a script in order to isolate the MWE also produces some insight about the issue (and potentially about the test).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416:1174,expose,exposes,1174,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416,1,['expose'],['exposes']

PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free.

Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest).

Security,"The convention we use for the other variables stored on faces is that our ""interior"" data spans from `i=1` to `i=N`. Thus we call the `i=N+1` a ""halo point"" for fields on faces, even though it really is not (its on the boundary, see #455). . In addition, we use a convention that face indices are ""left"" of cell indices. Thus `iFace=1` corresponds to the ""left"" boundary of the domain. `iCell=N` is the rightmost cell in the domain; and `iFace=N+1` corresponds to the rightmost boundary. Why do you want ""direct"" access to the surface at `k=Nz`? Can you explain why you want this? This is confusing to me and I don't see why we would want to have an odd and surprising convention for the vertical coordinate. The fact is simply that the face at `i=N` is a very concrete and real place. It lies in the interior of the domain, to the left of the cell point `i=N`. This is a fact of our grid and must be internalized by anyone who wants to work with the discrete data and index fields directly by raw index.

Then users could implement this kind of optimization in their script by using an array to represent the forcing, and then by precomputing the forcing into that array using a kernel that only evaluates some subset of all the cells in a callback.

Security,"Well, there was a major bug associated with the fact that we were trying to avoid precomputed the diffusivities. Basically, diffusivities cannot be computed on the fly due to the ""predictor-corrector"" algorithm we use for implicit time stepping. Opting to precompute diffusivities solves this problem, at the cost of three additional 3D model fields when using `TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivity`. I think this is not a huge price to pay considering that models with 3 velocities and n tracers have (3 + n) * 3 fields already; thus in the simplest case (one buoyancy tracer and one TKE tracer) we incur ~20% (3/15) additional memory allocation from diffusivity precomputation. We can optimize memory allocation further in the future as well, potentially. On the upside, things are looking pretty good now.

Security,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests).

I propose that in order to move forward, we should generate a few additional validation tests including some with bathymetry. Once we have those and have analyzed them to ensure we are satisfied with the dynamics, we should then work on designing a better regression test --- one that won't ""pass"" when it should not.

Maybe a topographic Rossby wave or some such would help build confidence that we are treating non-uniform bathymetry correctly with both of the formulations that we have. Thanks for the explanation. I agree that looking at a topographic Rossby wave is a good test to have. In the case of a small linear slope and small amplitude wave, it should be close to an exact solution so that will be easy. If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography.

Security,"ions on #1241 (and proposed as a solution there). Specifically, abstraction operations that failed to compile due to a recursive call to `identity` now compile, because we use different identity functions. The compiler doesn't complain and compiles these objects. This includes operators like `u - v + w` as demonstrated in my example. This hack doesn't allow us to execute arbitrarily complex abstract operations on the GPU. I don't think we can guarantee execution of arbitrary code in general. In this case, there are other issues that compiler might encounter that are not related to recursive calls to `identity`. We identified two additional issues on https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738870593. There may be other problems that we haven't uncovered. An important additional case that doesn't work right now is operations that have embedded `AveragedField`. I think this is some kind of type inference issue. For `Field` on the GPU we ""throw away"" the wrapper and expose the underlying `OffsetArray` to GPU kernels. So compilation of functions of `Field` is ""no more difficult"" than compilation of functions with `OffsetArray`. This idealization is successful because indexing into the underlying `field.data` is identical indexing into the field itself, and because we don't require field locations _inside_ the kernel (we build expression trees for AbstractOperations on the CPU, prior to launching the kernel). But this idealization doesn't hold for `AveragedField` or any `ReducedField`. In particular, abstract operations index into these objects at all `i, j, k`. However, they don't vary on one or more of these directions; the indexing operation needs to be ""collapsed"" so that reduced indices are translated correctly. Thus when we adapt `AveragedField` for the GPU, we hold onto the wrapper:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/98cd4f7a56aa581defc721a01d6e1ab89b534d26/src/Fields/averaged_field.jl#L94-L96.

Security,"on for our more adventurous users that want to experiment with new viscosities/diffusivities. Is the issue about what we define as ""feasible""? It's simple to add a new struct with a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I agree though that this could result in more boilerplate. So, the difference is really just ""how much code"" one needs to write to get to a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I think I would prefer a simple interface that allows users to dispatch on the type of `closure.ν`, ie something like. ```julia; calculate_diffusivities!(diffusivities, closure::ScalarDiffusivity, args...) =; calculate_diffusivities!(closure.ν, closure.κ, diffusivities, closure, args...) =; ```. Then if users have special viscosities that require computation, they can define a custom `calculate_diffusivities!(ν::MyCustomViscosity, ...)`. Another interface could un-comment these fields:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/1a288c175d07b3d4262e965c7e75376d5541e24d/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/scalar_diffusivity.jl#L117-L121. and then users can define fields with custom `compute!` definitions. If we have an interface like the one above, we may not need a separate struct for `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation` at all. It really boils down to where we put information about the closure, such as free parameters. Right now we have an interface that encourages a new struct that subtypes `AbstractScalarDiffusivity`. An alternative is to do away with ""abstract"" scalar diffusivity, and generalize the concrete `ScalarDiffusivity` to any computed viscosity / diffusivity. This would then cover cases like `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and move the free parameters associated with AMD from the turbulence closure struct into the viscosity struct.

Security,"pproach could completely fail if we had cut cells, which represents another caveat. The problem is that, when the cell facets are no longer oriented along one of x, y, z, we need to define what a flux across the bottom _means_. Is it a flux normal to the boundary, or is it a flux projected along one of the orthogonal directions? I'm not sure interpreting `ImmersedBoundaryCondition(bottom=flux)` as representing _only_ the vertical component of the bottom flux is sensible, especially when we consider the small scale limit or large eddy simulation or direct numerical simulation. We'll have to discuss that. To elaborate on the details, the geological constraint we have from observations is on the heat flux averaged over large patches of the ocean basin:. $$ Q_\text{obs} \approx \frac{1}{A} \int \boldsymbol{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} d A $$. where $A$ is the surface area of the ocean bottom (not the horizontal area). As you have noted, we can reproduce this constraint by applying the flux $Q$ across all upward facing facets. Then the total flux in our model is. $$ Q_\text{model} = \frac{1}{A_h} \int Q_\text{obs} d A_h $$. where $A_h$ is the horizontal area of the ocean basin and $d A_h$ is the horizontal projection of the surface area of the bottom. Clearly we obtain $Q_\text{model} = Q_\text{obs}$ and our goal is achieved. At small scales, this approximate model becomes questionable (but of course, it is also questionable to use a constant heat flux at small scales). Basically, I think that using this convenience actually obscures the true physics. So while it produces the right answer, it leads to confusion about what the observed geological heat flux actually represents, and the detailed physics of heat flux across irregular boundaries... That said, I take the very important point that the convenience greatly simplifies applying this kind of model at large scales. So I am more convinced that we should expose `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` to users --- despite the dangers...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3141#issuecomment-1587736510:2246,expose,expose,2246,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3141#issuecomment-1587736510,1,['expose'],['expose']

Ok, no rush!. Trig functions aren't generically slower on GPUs than CPUs. On CPUs I think our code is fairly non-optimal right now, so various sources of overhead (eg non-optimal threading) can ""hide"" slow operations on the CPU. On the GPU we are more efficient, so overall speed might depend more sensitively on user code when it's injected. (I'd also argue that the beginning of this section is a bit misleading in how it claims we ""try to optimize"" internal source code. In fact, we have performed almost no performance optimization, and this is an important topic for future work.). I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU.

Security,"tself is calling some kind of spline. ```julia; spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, df.scale, k=1) ; ```. Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to your setup? Interpolations.jl might be an option but I'm not sure if it's GPU compatible. Worst case scenario maybe it wouldn't be too hard to code up a simple spline/interpolation scheme?. If you're looking for a 5~10x speedup you could try running multithreaded (run `julia -t n` where `n` is the number of threads to use) until a GPU version i",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660:1343,access,accessed,1343,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660,1,['access'],['accessed']

Security,"ure out a clean way of integrating `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` with the existing time-stepping. Perhaps we just need a `maybe_fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` function that only does something on a connected cubed sphere. 4. We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. 9. Figure out a way to abstract and clean up `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` and `fill_*_halo!`... 10. Merge utils from `src/CubedSpheres/cubed_sphere_utils.jl` and `src/Distributed/distributed_utils.jl` into `Oceananigans.Grids`. 11. Figure out if the tests in `test_cubed_sphere_halo_exchange.jl` can be abstracted and run for all six faces. It's tedious to have to type them out but could be clearer and easier to debug in its current form... 12. Fix tests!. 13. I think cubed sphere performance can be improved, especially for halo filling.

Testability," code feature? Just to be clear, I'm not saying it should be one way or another, but it's good to have explicit justification for source code features (which are expensive to maintain and require resources to test)!; > ; > No problem at all, [heres](https://gist.github.com/jagoosw/213d7f2ce3707768d4ddb07f8827cdd2) an example (not sure where best to put this/if you'd want it in the examples folder). This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model. I also envisage using this to exert drag on the flow at some point.; > ; > ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) [ ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) [ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif); > ; > Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.; > ; > (I fix the tests that's failed until we've",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2724#issuecomment-1239608678:1244,test,test,1244,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2724#issuecomment-1239608678,1,['test'],['test']
Testability," factor of `sqrt(2)` snuck into our constant. As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-signals-in-gridgenerated-isotropic-turbulence/A3D7B0DD621DE46CB6CC543F65A66F93) (this wasn't possible when the closures were written because we didn't support triply periodic domains, but is possible now). This could also be used to validate Anisotropic Minimum Dissipation. Here's a figure with such a comparison from [Rozema et al 2015](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4928700):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127508527-e5f7d150-56c4-4949-ad8e-90d67fdbee64.png). I believe for shear flows it has also been found that the constant needs to be as small as `C=0.1` or smaller? It'd be nice to mention and cite these in the docstring as well, if we can find those references.

Testability," few functions:; - `external_cell` identifies whether a _tracer cell_ (or perhaps the ""reference cell"" --- the one located at center, center, center) is outside the `Bounded` domain (this has no effect in `Periodic` directions); - `external_node` identifies whether a _location_ is external to the `Bounded` domain. We use the term ""node"" because this can be used for cells _or_ cell interfaces. `external_node` is `false` for locations that ""touch"" wet cells.; - `peripheral_node` identifies whether a location is either _on or external_ to the `Bounded` domain. So this intersects with `external_node` in the exterior, but additionally contains locations that touch wet cells.; - `immersed_peripheral_node` identifies locations that are on or external to the immersed domain, but _not_ external to the underlying grid domain (we need this so that we don't apply immersed boundary conditions at all peripheral nodes).; - `immersed_cell` is now the name of the function `is_immersed` --- immersed boundary implementations define this to obtain correct logic for boundary conditions. We then extend `external_cell` to cover both the external cells of the underlying bounded domain and the immersed cells. I think there's still a fair amount of work to do on this interface but hopefully this is a good step forward. Here's a few more thoughts:. * It seems that we should really use `Bounded` topology to be synonymous with ""impenetrable"". This might help us disentangle a few issues (eg satisfying impenetrability, correct divergences, etc.) I think we are discovering that in some cases its better to hard code certain ""assumed boundary conditions"" directly into operators, such as impenetrable conditions (considering complex domains is the key to realize the right abstractions here, since there are many simple solutions for non-complex domains and no obvious way to distinguish their tradeoffs). This means that we need to ""assume"" boundary conditions based on grid topology (information centrali",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100699430:1813,log,logic,1813,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100699430,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"**Final Commit Details**. Remove 4/3 factor, && --> &, ζ=NaN where undefined. 1. Remove 4/3 Factor in Vorticity Computation: The 4/3 factor was initially introduced in the vorticity calculation at the corners because the area used to divide the circulation (in the denominator) was reduced to three-quarters of its original value. However, it turns out that by adopting the Haversine formula for calculating the quadrilateral area on a sphere---which simplifies to a triangle when two points coincide---the 4/3 factor is inherently accounted for. Therefore, the explicit inclusion of this factor is no longer necessary. 2. Replace Short-Circuiting && with Logical &: Changed the short-circuiting && operator to the logical & operator to ensure compatibility with GPU operations. 3. Set Circulation Γ and Vorticity ζ to NaN when Undefined: Updated the code to assign NaN (Not a Number) to circulation Γ and vorticity ζ in cases where they are undefined. @glwagner, @navidcy, could one of you please review this PR once the tests pass, so I can proceed with merging?

(Btw, the example above obviously works fine with `architecture=CPU()`, where I can check that `dwpdz_nested` actually produces the correct result.). I even ran some other tests with even increased complexity. And they all appear to work on GPUs. For example this one:. ```julia; function crazy_calc(); p = ComputedField(sum(model.pressures)); wp = ComputedField(@at (Center, Center, Face) w*p); dwpdz = (1/1024) * ∂z(wp); println(dwpdz); dwpdz = ComputedField(dwpdz); dwpdz2 = ComputedField(dwpdz^2); return ComputedField(dwpdz2+dwpdz); end; ```. I'd appreciate if some of you could try to reproduce this result on other machines. I ran this in one of NCAR's Tesla V100s. If you can reproduce this behavior, then this kinda makes `KernelComputedField`s obsolete, no?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-786777011:7948,test,tests,7948,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-786777011,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"> (this is how PISCES implements a lot of the growth to prevent repetitive calculation of the same values, I don't know if this would be faster in this setting without testing but just as an example). I agree that we need this feature, but from a software design perspective one might argue that such an invasive change to model dynamics belongs in the source code itself, rather than a callback (and this of course how it works for PISCES, or any model other than Oceananigans --- since Oceananigans is the only model where we can envision such a fine-grained callback schema). I think having a callback infrastructure like this effectively allows people who implement advanced / custom applications to keep their code up to date with other changes to Oceananigans. The alternative model for software design, which is simply to create a new version of the source code for your custom application, leads to much more code duplication. So you could say that the callback feature could be important for the community to share advanced custom modifications to Oceananigans, without creating a terrible tangle in `main`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2773#issuecomment-1279336660:168,test,testing,168,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2773#issuecomment-1279336660,1,['test'],['testing']
Testability,"> 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). I quite like the current convention for specifying fluxes since (imho) it's more mathematically intuitive, so my vote goes to maintaining that convention if we can (although I agree that it makes it harder to apply it generally for immersed solids...). One way to do it would be to leave most of the heavy work for the user, which would have to specify fluxes in each of the immersed solid's interfaces separately. The user's script would look like what I did here:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/faed0c4ac85409cb94811b0bdba2bbb7becf330a/sandbox/drag_test.jl#L25-L41. The downside is that this won't work for non-grid-fitted boundaries and requires more user-written code. The upside is that could (I think) re-use much of the inner-workings of the current BC implementation. > We can do 2. without 1. In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs. Not sure I understand this point. Do you mind clarifying @glwagner? By ""overhang"" do you mean that there's no fluid-to-the-bottom-immersed-boundary-to-the-top interface?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975:1053,sandbox,sandbox,1053,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975,1,['sandbox'],['sandbox']

If my understanding is correct, you'd only need to change the definition of the volumes and areas to account for the partial step and it seems to significantly decrease form drag. Oh for sure, and hopefully we will also eventually have shaved cells which will reduce form drag even more. But you could also calculate that by the time we have partial cells working well with the FFT-based nonhydrostatic solver, et cetera, we might also have a more general implementation for boundary fluxes.

Testability,"> > @tomchor since you're the main person using the tilted gravity feature, I'm wondering if you can help provide some insight into this ""stratified fluid at rest"" test. The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason.; > ; > I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that.; > ; > So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though. My best guess is to do something similar to what I did for the rotated Coriolis: solve a system with gravity pointing upwards and then the same system with gravity pointing to the `x` or `y` direction and see if they match after the proper rotation. Can't we just test directly that the output of `x_dot_b` is as expected (as well as the others)? Along with a test that the constructor works without error this seems sufficient. More complicated integration tests, like testing that the discrete system has a balanced state analogous to the continuous one, seem better suited for a validation test, I think.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890058586:164,test,test,164,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890058586,13,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"> > I'm strongly opposed to having multiple small packages.; >; > Why is that, given the benefits?. Mainly I think we can get all the same benefits by maintaining a single unified and tidy repository with sub-modules. I don't see Oceananigans as a complex project yet, we're barely at 2,500 lines of code (minus turbulence closure operators which aren't integrated yet). I can see reasons for having a separate repository for examples and tutorials if there are enough of them, but I don't see e.g. the output writers as being logically separate from the main code. As a stand alone package, OceananigansOutput.jl doesn't do anything useful. Something like TurbulenceClosures.jl could though. Keeping things in tidy submodules within a single repository increases code visibility, which I think is important. When I see a package or framework spread across multiply small packages I find it hard to get an idea about what it can do. Another nice thing is we currently have ""unified versioning"" so when releases occur we know everything works together. We don't have to worry about running with Oceananigans v0.x with OceananigansPlotting v0.y and OceananigansOutput#master to fix some issue. From a development perspective, issues and pull requests are now spread across multiple repositories and we can end up with pull requests that depend on other pull requests in other repositories, e.g. when adding in halo regions the main code got refactored but so did the output writers and plotting code would change as well. We can also end up with multiple test suites that need to pass, plus possibly multiple CI pipelines to manage. So right now it's easy to make atomic changes that touch upon multiple pieces of code (and we'll probably be in this stage where we need to refactor frequently for a while). I also don't have to git clone a bunch of repositories just to work on a simple example.

Can you point to them for us? Have you considered expanding to ""online"" capabilities? What are the pros and cons of that?. The two models we currently have some support for (offline) are `MITgcm` and `oceananigans.jl`. . I have examples for both models in <https://gaelforget.github.io/ClimateModels.jl/dev/examples/> which you can run the JuliaClimate sandbox <https://juliaclimate.github.io/Notebooks/> and generate the kind of model output that `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` or `IndividualDisplacement.jl` can then ingest as input for offline computation. The `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` documentation has corresponding examples on the ecology + bgc side. An online mode with models like `MITgcm` and `oceananigans.jl` would be useful in my view, in the case of both `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` or `IndividualDisplacement.jl`. With this being said, I tend to most like the idea of small'ish modeling components developed outside of monolitic modeling efforts that emphasize code re-usability and integration with multiple models. .

Testability,"> @matinraayai is working on making PencilArrays performant. This PR is exploratory and is a fallback that might not be merged if we find an efficient way to do GPU transposes with PencilArrays (requires reducing memory allocations and improving the efficiency of permute operations) and implement r2r Fourier transforms in PencilFFTs. For the moment those two elements are part of this PR.; > ; > This PR follows the (simple) configuration of the 2decomp library https://github.com/2decomp-fft/2decomp-fft, the difference between PencilFFT/PencilArray and this PR (a part bounded domain ffts) is that here (at the moment) we impose the stricter limitation that `Ny` has to be divisible by `Rx` and `Ry` while `Nz` has to be divisible by `Ry`, where `Rx` and `Ry` are the number of ranks (divisions) in the x and y direction. Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either. Something we do not previously support (but which is implemented in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538) was an algorithm that could support any topology with vertically-stretched grids. What is the relationship between this PR and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538, and does this PR support vertically stretched grids?. One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension. Since we almost always would like to use vertically stretched grids (and for various reasons, we may want to also compute the hydrostatic pressure with a vertical integral), ocean LES are typically distributed in x and y. Therefore, in order to support 2D domain decompositions, we were faced with somehow ch",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3279#issuecomment-1728278859:968,benchmark,benchmarking,968,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3279#issuecomment-1728278859,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

Testability,"> @tomchor since you're the main person using the tilted gravity feature, I'm wondering if you can help provide some insight into this ""stratified fluid at rest"" test. The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason. I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that. So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though. My best guess is to do something similar to what I did for the rotated Coriolis: solve a system with gravity pointing upwards and then the same system with gravity pointing to the `x` or `y` direction and see if they match after the proper rotation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890043769:162,test,test,162,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890043769,8,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model.

Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.

But I'm not 100% sure. For example, it's presumably possible to have a solid interface at (c, c, c) even when the tracer cell is _not_ solid (ie it's a partial cell that's half-filled...).

It's worth considering whether the standard `Info` and `Debug` levels might be enough for some of your uses, but there's also nothing wrong with trying out some custom levels and removing them if they don't end up making sense. For general logging I've often wondered whether it would be helpful to have a `Notice` level with severity between `Info` and `Warn` to allow informational messages to be stratified into two groups, though we would need clear guidelines for how to use it. Likewise, to have a `Debug2` or `VerboseDebug` level for ""really verbose"" debugging messages (possibly compiled out by default, though that would need a minor tweak in Base to make it possible). > but for user-facing info messages maybe we should remove the file name and line number and instead a custom log level like `DIAGNOSTIC` or `MODEL_SETUP` will be useful.

Testability,"> I believe for your implementation, since the tracer values are not corrected for pressure, any leakage will be due to the advection of tracer by momentum that _is_ impacted by the pressure correction. This advection should be less with a smaller spacial step if I remember correctly. Well, I agree that less leakage implies that less tracer is advected across the boundary. But why is less tracer advected across the boundary?. It occurs to me that we are not converging to a particular solution as we refine the grid in this case, because this problem has no viscosity. Perhaps we should do a convergence test for a case with finite viscosity. We do introduce grid-scale gradients in the predictor velocity field via masking, so it does seem possible to me that the leakage / pressure gradient error might scale with resolution. It'd be nice to have a solid mathematical explanation for this behavior. Another question might be whether the leakage / error depends on the extent of the masked region (holding resolution constant). I'm not sure whether its worth looking into all this stuff though --- it might be better simply to work on implementing an accurate pressure solver, since I don't think it would be too difficult.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-867965142:608,test,test,608,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-867965142,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"> I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2*2*5*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who _do_ use codes that rely _heavily_ on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?"" (like I did when I saw the examples). I don't disagree with anything here. I just think users should be able to run using whatever resolution they want and know that the code has been tested and works with weird inefficient resolutions. To encourage users maybe we can print a ""performance warning"" if the grid resolution is not the product of a small number of prime divisors?. > I certainly prefer that.

My intuition from seeing results from papers (and from previous LES+IBM at my previous group) is that partial step cells would be almost as accurate as shaved cells (at least for oceanic cases with mild bathymetry slopes) but significantly simpler to implement. Since we already have the full-cell grid-fitted IBM it might be better to just focus on that for now and later modify it to make it partial-step when everything is working well (I think we'd just need to modify the calculation of vertical areas and volumes, no?). Also, when running ocean LES the aspect ratios are generally isotropic (Δz/Δx~1) but the bathymetry slopes are very small, which means that for some cases even full-step grid-fitted IBM might be enough.

I often find myself spending way longer on PRs than I initially anticipate so I'm generally not very good at assessing these things lol. ok ok! Here's a rule of thumb: a bugfix or refactor is the least committment, because you can get away with no new tests or docs. A new _feature_ takes more time because of documentation. One should expect to spend most of their time on docs and tests. If you're spending a lot of time implementing a feature, then either the feature is very complicated / hard, or your workflow can use some improvement. Among new features, different types of features require different amount of effort. This case is one of the easier cases --- it's extending functionality without changing existing functionality, also its fairly niche (at this point) so simple documentation will suffice. The work required to test the feature also has already been partially completed (the script you posted). Other features, like adding new _physics_ will take much longer, because often you'll have to run a full validation case + analysis to assess whether things work as expected. So even if the source code change is small to implement new physics, the validation will take a while and dominate the development effort.

This differs from `Value` or `Gradient` which communicate the notion of either a solid wall or fixed external state. The alternative propose is to get rid of `Open` entirely, which we could do.

If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those.

There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography.

If we get rid of `Cb` then we may want to introduce an alternative way to eliminate the buoyancy correction entirely (currently achievable with `Cb=0`). A further caveat is that using `1/Pr` only applies if `Pr` is the same for all tracers and if a linear equation of state links tracers to buoyancy. With nonlinear equations of state it's unclear what to use for `Cb`. I believe we also allow a different `Pr` for every tracer.

Si Chen has been testing the code with a buouyant tracer added through forcing like this and he is running a comparison with Jenny Dingwall's simulations with Diablo.

The WENO operators were coded so that we can readily integrate them with the existing operators in `tracer_advection_operators`.

Testability,"> While we should try to use powers of 2 for performance, I think that overly restricts the model resolutions we can be running at. There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2\*2\*5\*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who *do* use codes that rely *heavily* on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?""

This is algorithm that underlies the FFT approach. The FFT just optimizes (and makes it more complicated) by utilizing the fact that the eigenvector/eigenvalue coefficients for the simple, constant spacing Poisson problem, are the cos and sin terms in an FFT. Code appears to work so I am going to try and hack together a ""_plugin_"" for ```solve_poisson_3d_mbc```. . The code won't be super high performance (or work for really big problems) but (fingers crossed) it should give something clean (and short) to get started and help with debugging/optimizing on GPU. Then we can work on various FFT approaches on CPU and GPU (3-d FFT, 2-d + cyclic reduction), Greg's thought on saving for gradients in continuous form. . In principle the eigenvectors and eigenvalues above should correspond with amplitudes that come out of FFTW - except that there are a bunch of 1/2 factors, N versus m numbers, complex versus split cos/sin notation bits that need to be carefully understood etc.... . Just going to learn a little about sparse matrices in Julia - I assume they must exist! Hopefully the car will take a little longer to be finished. .

Testability,"@francispoulin ! No worries about the question. I like questions. To answer your latest question --- our nonhydrostatic pressure solver is based on FFTs for regular grids and is therefore quite fast. In simple benchmarks long ago we found that other parts of the algorithm dominated the cost of a time-step. Because of that we aren't sure that having a hydrostatic-only solver would help. Of course, the story is different if we need to stretch the grid in horizontal directions. That said, it would still be interesting to be able to solve hydrostatic-only problems. This would complicate the algorithm a bit because you have to distinguish the barotropic mode, and perform a 2D pressure solve. We already have a function to integrate the buoyancy field to obtain the hydrostatic pressure. For ""things I want worked on"" my wish list falls into three categories: new physics features, new numerics / algorithms, and more boring software / UI work. Here's a couple... 1. Finishing the vertically-stretched grid implementation (numerics). We started work on this but its incomplete. This is a tricky and arduous task but would be quite nice to have... 2. Vertically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281:210,benchmark,benchmarks,210,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

Testability,"@glwagner @tomchor ; I have just tested the turbulent boundary layer with wall model using Oceananigans on Julia 1.6.7 and Julia 1.9.2. The performances of AMD in both versions are exactly the same. It turns to overestimate the velocity shear at the second node from the wall, therefore, turns to overestimate the velocity in the middle and upper parts of the boundary layers. I used to use the SGS model based on the Lagrangian-averaged scale-dependent dynamic model (LASD) (https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/17/2/025105/895722/A-scale-dependent-Lagrangian-dynamic-model-for). @tomchor is very familiar with this SGS model.

Testability,"@glwagner I think I see what you mean now. It's definitely a harder problem than I anticipated. I think the ideal way would be to infer these conditions automatically, but like you said that may be a very hard problem. I don't think it's ill-posed, since you basically have all the necessary information in one way or another. So if I, a human, can arrive at the right answer with the same information, I think a program could do the same. Second best way would be to try infer the right BCs but provide an option to manually force a certain BC. I think inferring should be relatively easy in very simple cases, no? ~For example, in the pseudo-code below...~. ```julia. ... # Some code; UVelocityBoundaryConditions(grid, top = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0), bottom = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0),); ... # More code. dudz_comp = ComputedField(∂z(u)); compute!(dudz_comp); ```. ~This currently produces something with the wrong derivatives at the boundary, but I'd expect that it wouldn't be too hard to get this one right automatically since you basically have to do something similar to solve the Boussinesq equations. Am I wrong?~. Finally, I don't oppose relying completely on the user to provide the BCs for the ComputedFields like you said. Mostly I don't know the difference in the amount of effort between these options!

Testability,"@navidcy Thanks for the feedback. I added a docstring for `aligned_time_step` that explains its purpose:. ```; aligned_time_step(sim). Returns a time step Δt that is aligned with the output writer schedules and stop time of the simulation `sim`.; The purpose of aligning the time step is to ensure simulations do not time step beyond the `sim.stop_time` and; to ensure that output is written at the exact time specified by the output writer schedules.; ```. ---. > 1. Why does `aligned_time_step(sim)` return a negative time-step? Is this a bug? ; > 2. Why is this fix temporary? What would a more permanent fix look like?; > ; > It seems that aligning the time-step is causing a host of issues. Is this the real problem? Should we stop aligning time-steps until we are sure that we can do it safely?. @glwagner Sorry I thought I explained the issue in #1280 but looks like I didn't. The problem has to do with checkpointing and pickup when output writers are using `TimeInterval` schedules. Output writer schedules are not checkpointed so when you pickup a simulations that includes output writers with `TimeInterval` schedules, the `model.clock` is restored but the `schedule.previous_actuation_time` is 0 for all `TimeInterval` schedules. So `aligned_time_step` thinks it needs to take a negative time step as it needs to write output at t = `schedule.time_interval`. The permanent fix is to checkpoint and pickup schedules (properly fixing #1280) which would prevent `aligned_time_step` from returning negative time steps. I see this as more of a checkpointing issue than a time step alignment issue. In general we are not extensively testing checkpointing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1303#issuecomment-766101050:1639,test,testing,1639,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1303#issuecomment-766101050,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Generally looks fine. Some nice clean up!. It seems you're gravitating towards having fewer files which I think is a bad idea. Having more modular files helps a lot with both readability and organization, especially for someone who's looking through the code for the first time. It also becomes harder to find stuff with longer files. For example, It's not logically clear to me that forcings and field sets should be in `models.jl`. And if I'm looking through the file for the first time, I might find it hard to comprehend all the different functionalities provided in the file. Unrelated to this PR but working on the checkpointer in `output_writers.jl` the file has become a long list of functions, some of which are shared between multiple output writers so I think it makes more sense to split it into a set of shared functions and a file for each output writer.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/325#issuecomment-517483988:357,log,logically,357,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/325#issuecomment-517483988,1,['log'],['logically']

Testability,"Hey thanks for doing all this! Things look a lot neater. Just have a few comments/thoughts that I'll pepper throughout but should be good to merge!. > A `Model` constructor is now provided in which all important information can be input via keyword arguments. This is great for understanding what the model does, I agree. Would still be nice to keep the ""legacy constructor"" around for when you just want to create a simple `Model` for playing around with or for testing. And it makes for very nice and simple example code. > I also reduced the computational burden of a few of the tests, and changed to factor of 2 resolutions since this makes sense for FFTs (though relatively unimportant for testing, I think should encourage users to use powers of 2 and make a habit of using them ourselves). I would argue against this. While we should try to use powers of 2 for performance, I think that overly restricts the model resolutions we can be running at. There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. Either way, we should always be testing a wide range of grid sizes (and weird grid sizes like `109x77x13`) because the code should work for all of them. If computational cost becomes an issue we should look into paying for extra CI resources rather than reduce testing. > A few more notes:. Might be good to create some new issues based on those just to keep track of what needs to be done. > The examples are outdated. We should probably reduce the number of examples until the code becomes more stable, and commit to maintaining the few that remain. This is something I'm actively working on in a different branch.

Testability,"Hi @c42f thank you for chiming in! Will definitely ping you as we work on logging. I think we probably should have tackled logging much earlier. We still use `@printf` and vanilla `@info` for logging, which has been quite counter-productive haha. Definitely hoping we can reach a useful logger that can; * help developers by providing info and debug messages. Also nice in test logs.; * help users understand what the model is doing and provide a better and more responsive user experience by logging what the model is doing. This is where `@setup` and `@diagnostic` logging messages might be really nice. Although `@setup` and `@diagnostic` might be bad names as they don't imply logging? Not sure of the best solution but maybe your kwarg suggestion would help here, e.g. `@info source=""diagnostic"" msg`?. @arcavaliere seems to be developing a pretty general-purpose `ModelLogger` which hopefully we can adapt for all these uses! @arcavaliere I'm more than happy to help if you need anything. MicroLogging.jl looks pretty neat! I like that it puts the log level, file name, and line number on the right as putting them on the left causes messages not to align and makes logs harder to read. TensorBoardLogger looks pretty cool!

Testability,"Hmmm, I don't know if many log levels will be that helpful. I guess for debug messages we'll want to have the file name and line number, but for user-facing info messages maybe we should remove the file name and line number and instead a custom log level like `DIAGNOSTIC` or `MODEL_SETUP` will be useful. I think one place that logging can hugely improve user experience is in setting up large models, especially on the GPU, where you could be waiting for several minutes while all of Julia, CUDA, and Oceananigans compiles, model is being set up, memory is allocated, etc. We know it takes time but most users will think that something is wrong if Julia is silent for 5 minutes. In this context info messages can be useful and reassure the user that Oceananigans is working properly.

Testability,"I think any of those projects would be super welcome. A 1-layer shallow water model would be nice and simple, and @ali-ramadhan could use it for his MPI parallelization work since it has no pressure solver. A hydrostatic Boussinesq model would be super useful too of course. I think we should talk. We are working on a similar model using discontinuous Galerkin numerics over at [ClimateMachine.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl) and these projects would have overlapping goals. Nevertheless I would personally find it extremely useful to be able to run `Oceananigans.IncompressibleModel`s with a `HydrostaticPressureSolver` and `ExplicitFreeSurface` since I could use it to benchmark / compare with the DG functionality that I'm working on for `ClimateMachine`, and the relative advantages of high-order finite volume methods compared with DG may still be in question, at least for structured grids (meaning that an Oceananigans development effort is not a waste of time). Perhaps a zoom conversation on that topic is in order. I agree with the framework / level-of-difficulty that you've laid out for student projects!. As for deciding FourierFlows vs Oceananigans, that's up to you for sure and depends basically on whether you are okay staying with doubly-periodic systems (what FourierFlows currently supports) or whether you want to do problems with boundaries (what Oceananigans promises). FourierFlows is a nice tool for idealized problems and theoretical work (and you can run pretty large problems these days since it has GPU support); Oceananigans is evolving more towards a tool for ocean modeling that is capable of doing idealized problems, but flexible enough to use for large eddy simulation and realistic non-hydrostatic modeling, in bounded domains and hopefully irregular domains as well, eventually, using immersed boundaries.

Testability,"I think what we want in terms of API is the ability to specify boundary conditions on the surface of an immersed boundary. One design would be to introduce a type called `ImmersedBoundary` that collects information about the location of the boundary and the boundary conditions for each field prescribed on it. This could be relatively simple to implement in the code, though it doesn't exactly conform to our current code design in which boundary conditions are embedded in `Field` objects. Another possibility that may better conform to our current boundary conditions / field design would be to embed `boundaries` in `grid` objects. With this design, `ImmersedBoundary` collects only information about its geometry and parameters related to its numerical implementation (eg regularization functions, interpolation methods, etc). We can then infer from `grid` the information needed to define boundary conditions for fields in both (`x` ,`y`, `z`), as well as on any `ImmersedBoundary`s. Grid constructors would then be something like. ```julia; grid = RegularCartesianGrid(; immersed_boundaries = ImmersedBoundary(geometry = # a function of (x, y, z, t); transfer_function = # parameters ; ); topology = # etc; ); ```; ; As for verification, I think we should use a quantitative test that verifies that boundary conditions are satisfied on the immersed boundary.

Testability,"I think you instantiate a model to do many things; one of them is time-stepping, but another may be analysis. Another is testing. Even now we can't actually solve poisson's equation without a `Model` easily, which seems like an unnecessary restriction of our non-modularity. I don't think we should make this problem worse. I think it makes sense `model` is a field of `Simulation`. Its simple to envision `Simulation` parameters that are identical, with a different underlying `model` (eg, changing the number of passive tracers)`. The way I envision a logical course for the development of complex software in general is that we start with the fundamental building blocks and make them as easy to use in their low-level form as possible. When we've decided we can proceed no farther, we add another layer of abstraction that fuses these underlying building blocks into a higher-order coherent object. And so on.

Testability,"I was thinking of doing some prototyping and benchmarking in a sandbox by building off the example in my PR https://github.com/vchuravy/GPUifyLoops.jl/pull/18. The PR contains an example that can be extended to rely on a `Grid` struct, multiple `FaceField`s and ` CellField`. So I'll prototype grids and fields that are `isbitstype` (you already helped by doing this for a grid in https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/issues/59#issuecomment-467660181) and test to see if they work on the GPU with GPUifyLoops.jl.

Testability,"I would like to start working on this. Note that in terms of maintenance burden, the docs already depend extensively on plotting. So I'm not sure a plotting extension will increase CI significantly. On the contrary we can start with a minimalist approach that simply uses the examples to test the functionality in the extension. I'd like to discuss design before starting. I think the basic functionality we need is to support automatically plotting of 2D fields. Basically we want to be able to write `heatmap!(ax, c)` and have it work automatically, eg if `c` is two-dimensional, then the non-trivial dimensions are automatically detected and appropriate node values inserted. I think this should work even if the dimensions are not `Flat`, so basically we just want to take a look at `size(c)`. We can also support `lines!` and `scatter!` and `scatterlines!` for 1D fields. Is there a streamlined way to do this for all situations, or do we need to add support for each method like `heatmap!`, `contour!`, `contourf!`, etc, individually?. A second question is how to support inspection of 3D fields.

This is the basic way to implement a quadratic drag from the interface in this PR. In this case what happens under the hood is that we create 4 `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` for the relevant faces of boundary-adjacent cells (the other 2 faces are normal to the given velocity component, so receive a no-penetration boundary condition). So there could be a type instability compiling all of those (which have been notoriously fickle to compile in the past). We clearly need to hard code quadratic drag though, because for stretched grids and partial cells (and other types of immersed boundaries in the future) we have to do precompute the logarithm of the grid metrics (to use in a Monin-Obukhov-type model) in each direction independently, as well as the logarithm of the roughness. It's too much for this PR though, so I think we should just document how to specify no-slip on immersed boundaries (which appears to be performant), and add a few tests.

To resolve this PR I could tidy up a simple matching scheme where we compute the mean outflow on the boundary and do a 1D advection for the boundary point, or relax to the external state if there is inflow.

Testability,"I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example. I Think this works quite well since a lot of BGC models write the sinking terms with the other forcing terms, but its a little cumbersome to write e.g. `sinking = div_Uc(i, j, k, grid, bgc.adv_scheme, bgc.u⃗ᵖ, fields.P)`, and model makers will need to do the setup stuff I've done to make the advective velocity fields.

Testability,"In this case if we see convergence with decreasing time-step (spatial resolution isn't relevant for these dynamics, which are at the grid scale and therefore not physical) then I suppose that would be an indication the issue is due to a finite time step. It's important to recognize that the dynamics of the _discrete_ linear equations are different than the continuous. When we have a smooth solution, such that our spatial discretization should approximate some exact smooth solution, we can test that refining the grid and time step leads to convergence to an exact solution. Moreover, we can estimate the time-scale of the dynamics using the time-scales of the smooth dynamics as a guide. An example is a resolved buoyancy oscillation: it has a timescale of roughly 1/N. This example is dominated by small amplitude (eg linear) noise at the grid scale. Therefore my initial time scale estimate of 1/N may not hold. Instead, we'd have to look at the discrete eigenvalues of the system at the very higheset wavenumbers (ie the Nyquist number 2pi / dx). We could then calculate the time-step that would be required to resolve these (completely unphysical) dynamics. I'm not sure what a lower bound on such spurious discrete dynamics might be. It could be far smaller than any physical time scale, ie as small as 1e-16, or smaller? Perhaps the evolution of grid scale noise also has to do with spatial resolution, so that could be another knob to vary. So if we want to investigate this further, we should conduct a systematic study of the dynamics of this grid-scale noise system affected by buoyancy, decreasing the time-step to zero. Or we can convince ourselves that non-noisy dynamics _are_ accurate --- eg by analyzing a system like the one we use for our ""internal wave"" dynamics test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/test/test_internal_wave_dynamics.jl. that test verifies that a wave packet in our code propagates at the correct group speed, for example.

Testability,"Interesting, thanks for those details! That's odd that there are changes in memory allocation associated with building diagnostics. I don't think there's been changes to `Field` between 0.77.5 and 0.78.0. @navidcy might be able to say more. I think 0.78.0 only upgraded the tests to julia 1.8?. I'm also curious why the diagnostics consume so much memory. Are you producing a lot of 3D time averages (which can't be constructed in post-processing?) We've attempted to design the code so that reductions can be performed with minimal memory allocation. 3D diagnostics can simply be calculated from snapshots of the model state, so there's no need to allocate memory (assuming that static memory greatly exceeds GPU memory, this would be preferred).

Testability,"NaNs often occur either because the time step is too small, or because the problem being posed is too extreme or not physical (such that a reasonable and stable time step cannot be found). One issue is that the use of `ValueBoundaryCondition` is incorrect here:. ```julia; w_bcs = WVelocityBoundaryConditions(grid, top = ValueBoundaryCondition(0.0), bottom=ValueBoundaryCondition(0.0)); ```. You are trying to specify an impenetrable boundary condition on the vertical velocity, which requires `NormalFlowBoundaryCondition`:. ```julia; w_bcs = WVelocityBoundaryConditions(grid, top = NormalFlowBoundaryCondition(0.0), bottom=NormalFlowBoundaryCondition(0.0)); ```. this is also the default for a grid with `topology(grid) = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)`, so there's no need to specify it explicitly. In other words, try changing . ```julia; boundary_conditions = (u=u_bcs, v=v_bcs, w=w_bcs, T=T_bcs)); ```. to . ```julia; boundary_conditions = (u=u_bcs, v=v_bcs, T=T_bcs)); ```. in your constructor for `IncompressibleModel`. A good approach for developing a complex simulation is to start with something simple (or something that worked previously) and modify the script incrementally (slowly!), re-running and re-testing the script after each significant change. For this is useful to run either a two-dimensional version of the problem or a very low resolution simulation. I also suggest adding some lines at the bottom of your script to plot the solution so you can visually inspect it after a run. Your setup looks like a laboratory-scale simulation of convection. I think starting with uniform cooling (rather than spatially varying), omitting the effect of salinity, and using an `IsotropicDiffusivity` in two-dimensions (rather than starting out in three dimensions) might be a good path forward for working and building up your script.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1432#issuecomment-791953056:1216,test,testing,1216,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1432#issuecomment-791953056,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Note there is already substepping implemented for CATKEVerticalDiffusivity and TKEDissipationVerticalDiffusivity. What are the challenges?

Testability,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations. I agree with the git history size issue and probably the method of including the `.png` files that @ali-ramadhan suggests would work -- I've never done it though.

Testability,"Okay, apologies. I just didn't quite understand what you meant when you said they _seem_ identical. Typically we would just write something like `T1 == T2`, which will return `true` or `false`, or equivalently something like `all(T1 .== T2)`. Another test is to use `isapprox` (also written `≈`) as in `all(T1 .≈ T2)`. Here's a bit more background on the reproducibility tests we currently have:. We have [""regression tests""](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/test/regression_tests) that test to ensure that output from a certain simulation remains identical across PRs, including tests that involve LES closures. These tests involve ~10 time steps. We conclude that results are ""identical"" when every grid point is within `sqrt(eps(T))`, where `T` is the floating point type (eg `Float64` or `Float32`), for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fc84215f76661e9f1cfb103dc18f86442cec9d89/test/regression_tests/hydrostatic_free_turbulence_regression_test.jl#L112. Many of our other tests also implicitly rely on reproducibility. I think, therefore, that we do have reproduciblity in many cases. However, it is quite possible that your case exposes some particular feature that leads to a loss of reprodicibility. I think perhaps the next step in order to make progress is to code up a ""minimal working example"" (often called an MWE), which involves relentlessly simplifying the examle until we isolate the essential complication that leads to a failure of the test. With that knowledge in hand, we can dig deeper to find the underlying cause (and hopefully fix it).

Testability,"Rigid lid is actually just a short step from having an implicit free surface (and looks like we are about to have a direct solver for simple domains ala #1869...) --- the math is identical for the implicit solve, with a few terms zero'd out (eg, take the limit of an infinitely long time step). This implies too that models with an implicit free surface that take very long time steps compared to the gravity wave time-scale (most large scale models...) are effectively quite close mathematically to the rigid lid case (notwithstanding effects of runoff, precipitation, and evaporation). It seems an _explicit_ rigid lid formulation is not very practically useful, mostly because iterative solves take longer so rigid lid models in complex domains where there's no direct solve end up being slower. I'm not sure if there are any advantages re: tracer conservation. The story might get more interesting with generalized vertical coordinates, too.

Okay, that makes sense. > So this seems to be a CPU issue. So the problem is that `ContinuousForcing` is rather slow on the CPU. That is a bit annoying. Kind of like how WENO is really slow on the CPU for unknown reasons. At least we have a workaround with `DiscreteForcing`... > Would a MWE help here?. I think what would help the most is a simple benchmarking script that compares identical forcing function implementations with `ContinuousForcing` and `DiscreteForcing` to no forcing.

Testability,"So I ended up defining `dictify` but wanted to apply it recursively to any of the kwargs that could be non-dicts (`outputs`, `output_attributes`, `global_attributes`, and `dimensions`). Found out that the general case is pretty difficult as lots of things implement `keys` and `outputs` (e.g. strings and arrays to name just two) and relying on `fieldnames` requires you to define an accompanying `fieldvalues` which seemed to require quite a bit of extra logic. So I stuck to the simple one-liner that only does something to named tuples; ```julia; dictify(outputs) = outputs; dictify(outputs::NamedTuple) = Dict(string(k) => dictify(v) for (k, v) in zip(keys(outputs), values(outputs))); ```; because it's a simple solution that works recursively for the most common use case (named tuples instead of dicts).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1139#issuecomment-722409494:456,log,logic,456,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1139#issuecomment-722409494,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"Some pretty promising Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks!. Couple of takeaways (all assuming a model with 128^3 grid points and QAB2 time stepping):; 1. **Low overhead**: You can advect up to ~100,000 particles on the CPU and up to ~10,000,000 particles on a (Titan V) GPU before the model slows down by more than 30%.; 2. **Great on GPUs**: Seems that the GPU is great for advecting millions of particles. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this. I'll start refactoring this PR using @glwagner's and @zhenwu0728's feedback, but I think it would be really great if we can keep this performance. # Benchmarks. ```; Oceananigans v0.44.1; Julia Version 1.5.2; Commit 539f3ce943 (2020-09-23 23:17 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-9.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); GPU: TITAN V; ```. ```; Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ N_particles │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 0 │ 361.749 ms │ 364.041 ms │ 364.293 ms │ 368.854 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ 1 │ 375.030 ms │ 376.591 ms │ 377.959 ms │ 385.248 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10 │ 377.251 ms │ 380.792 ms │ 387.560 ms │ 443.325 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100 │ 378.867 ms │ 381.194 ms │ 381.328 ms │ 383.461 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 1000 │ 378.076 ms │ 384.114 ms │ 383.611 ms │ 388.507 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975:51,benchmark,benchmarks,51,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

Testability,"Surprisingly I was able to get a distributed `IncompressibleModel` running just using multiple dispatch without having to modify any existing code, although a cleaner design might require a bit of refactoring. PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. ### Local topologies.

Testability,"Thank you for your feedback @maleadt! What is CUDAnative compilation? If you mean the precompilation phase when CUDAnative is first loaded, then it's not that as I start timing after all packages are loaded. I thought 6-7 minutes was normal/expected as @vchuravy et al. reported similar GPU compilation times for their shallow water model: https://github.com/JuliaLabs/ShallowWaterBench. I haven't done any rigorous benchmarking yet but out of those 6 minutes, ~1.5 minutes are spent on compiling code that creates CuFFT plans (the first plan takes 1.5 minutes then the others take <1 second). From watching the log I'm guessing the other 4.5 minutes are evenly split between setting up the model (creating CuArrays, initializing them, etc.) and the first time step (where the kernels are getting compiled presumably).

They also have tons of arguments crammed in as the structs I was passing weren't `isbitstype` (working on this #59). I should come back and update this issue once we do some proper benchmarking (note to self: nvprof seems like it's being deprecated in favor of Nsight).

Looks like it's just the one test in the time stepping section that's failing. Maybe something to do with how the boundary conditions are called during the time stepping? The Model test passes so it's not erroring during model initialization/construction. > I propose changing the struct `BoundaryConditions` to `ModelBoundaryConditions` for clarity. I'll always vote for clarity!. Just one initial question: I might be misunderstanding the purpose of `bc.calc` but why not `bc.impose(args...)` instead of `bc.calc(args...)` as we usually say that we _impose_ boundary conditions?.

Testability,"Thanks for running these tests, @glwagner. They really do look like the issue in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3290. > The easiest fix is to eliminate the pressure separation. Since we're waiting for the IBM-aware pressure solve, we could also just add an option to eliminate the pressure separation that would be `false` by default. That should be pretty easy. And then in the future when we're confident about the new algorithm we can eliminate the pressure separation completely (along with user interface an code simplifications that are possible with no pressure separation). > Another solution is to fix the hydrostatic pressure algorithm. Does it need fixing in this case though? The way I see it this is just a consequence of how the hydrostatic pressure is defined: a vertical integral of `b`, which doesn't play well with the assumption of a vertically-periodic domain. > We should also note that the vertical tridiagonal solve is not correct for vertically-periodic domains.

Testability,Thanks for running these tests. It would be nice to see how MPData performs in a 2D flow. . It's interesting that tweaking the number of iterations doesn't seem to make much difference. I'm a bit skeptical about this scheme though; it seems pretty diffusive and doesn't even beat third-order upwind which is way simpler. I might have introduced a bug although I went through the code again and it looks correct to me. Another possibility is that the high diffusivity is the trade-off for keeping the scheme positivity-preserving?; Godunov's theorem sets some tough standards -- it's not possible to obtain monotonic advection with a linear scheme beyond first order.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3434#issuecomment-1954700946:25,test,tests,25,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3434#issuecomment-1954700946,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"Thanks for the feedback @glwagner and @tomchor . I will respond soon but I have an updated I wanted to share. I did a simulation in each for 100 time steps a few times each.

I would not call these offical benchmarks but more back of the envelop calculations (between friends). But these numbers are, mostly, around 3, which is what I expected. . For fun, I will do the same thing with GPUs (and will find out if my new code runs on a GPU). I guess one mystery is why is it that my actual simulation ran so slowly?

Testability,"Thinking about this more, I think it would make sense to make an even more radical change. I think we should add `diagnostics`, `output_writers`, and `clock` to `Simulation`. . The `time_step!` function then performs a single time-step, whereas to run a simulation one should write `run!(simulation)`, which handles diagnostics, output writing, adaptive time-stepping, and logging in an integrated way. This orthogonalizes the design a bit: `diagnostics` and `output_writers` are not really aspects of a ""model"", if we use a narrow interpretation of a model as a discrete representation of a physical system. A single physical system might conceivably be associated with a wide range of disparate diagnostics and output, depending on what kind of science is being done. I think scripts become clearer. The user writes. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). simulation = Simulation(model; simulation_parameters...). simulation.diagnostics[:diag] = # something. run!(simulation); ```. As an example to illustrate why `Simulation` is orthogonal to `Model`, here's a possible clear and coherent usage of this separation:. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). set!(model; first_interesting_initial_condition...). first_simulation = Simulation(model, first_simulation_parameters...); first_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_first_simulation; run!(first_simulation). set!(model; second_interesting_initial_condition...) # same physical model, but different starting initial condition... no new memory allocated, no recompilation --- fast. second_simulation = Simulation(model, second_simulation_parameters...); second_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_second_simulation; run!(second_simulation); ```.

Testability,"Very good point. The background buoyancy does not satisfy the boundary conditions that are imposed. I will check it out later. If this is the case, then it is still mysterious why GPUs have a harder time with this than CPUs, but we will see and learn. Thanks for the suggestion.

The second time-step is when QuasiAdamsBashforth2 uses tendency information saved from the previous time-step. On the first time-step it's equivalent to a forward Euler scheme. I know the differences are small, 8th decimal place or so, but on such a coarse grid should we be expecting the same answers?. Hardware differences can produce results that differ by something like sqrt(eps(Float64)) I think. This is the tolerance we use for regression tests (but even those sometimes fail to pass on the GPU for some reason). Since the background buoyancy field has a linear gradient and your domain is bounded, can you try running the same simulation but explicitly resolving the background buoyancy field?

Testability,"Very good questions. I don't have very good answers, but happy to share my thoughts. I don't know how things will change for velocity but it should be clearer after we figure out how to deal with the tracers. As for how the velocity is set, we always set the normal velocity to be zero at the interface. The only difference is the `ParitalCell` has a bottom that can be higher and we need to take this into account when computing the fluxes in and out of this region. We haven't gotten there yet but it's part of the plan. There aren't any essential differences between the current method, what we call `GridFitted` and Adcroft et al. call a `FullCell` method, and the `PartialCell` method. The former is the limit when we choose the height of the topography in a cell interface to be zero, whereas the latter can pick it to be between a tolerance (currently 0.2) and 1 of the full depth. So the `GridFitted` boundary must have the boundary between fluid and solid at a face, whereas `PartialCell` can have it anywhere in the interior. That means that the interface is really at i + alpha where 0 \le alpha < 1, or something like that. I can imagine that sometime in the future they are part of the same function, but much testing must happen before. I don't believe we need to change how `solid_interface` works but I need to look over how it's defined to make sure.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2251#issuecomment-1042491748:1223,test,testing,1223,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2251#issuecomment-1042491748,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node.

Testability,"Well, it looks like this PR does not completely solve the problem, and the jury is out perhaps on whether it helps or not. I did learn a few things. It seems the race condition originates from an attempt to ""re-resolve"" the manifest during the test:. https://buildkite.com/clima/oceananigans/builds/17516#01920c32-4e89-4654-a4a8-9b077e51e87c/39-221. The puzzling part is how to solve the problem. I thought at first we could solve it by preventing the Manifest from being ""re-resolved"" --- perhaps by resolving it correctly during initialization? But actually, this isn't possible, since the problematic manifest in question is a temporary run that is created only for the tests (and its different from the project's manifest, because it also includes the test dependencies). This temporary test manifest can't be initialized as far as I can tell and is created independently for each test. Finally, it seems that some race conditions happen in a print statement (this is just from reading the error message). It all boils down eventually to these two lines:. https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/blob/5fbfa125045ce3e68ce10bf9fc1727bb3232c123/src/Operations.jl#L799-L800.

Testability,"What is the intent of these tests? Are they intended to be included in CI, or are they more in the style of “benchmarks” that are run relatively infrequently?. @edoddridge A twist on option 1 is to design a forcing that exactly cancels the terms associated with nonlinear and linear terms in a given equation for some simple initial condition consisting of sines and cosines. For example, pick an initial condition, calculate all terms in a given equation, and then write a forcing that exactly cancels those terms. Then check that the initial condition doesn’t change after a few time-steps. This method allows a test at low resolution with low computational burden and allows each nonlinear and linear term in each equation to be assessed separately. . It would also be good to run “benchmarks” that are designed to be run less frequently, which is a category I think some of the suggested tests fall into (?)

Testability,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests).

Testability,"`julia; julia> 0.165 * sqrt(2); 0.23334523779156072; ```. which is probably not a coincidence. However, I'm not sure how an extra factor of `sqrt(2)` snuck into our constant. As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-signals-in-gridgenerated-isotropic-turbulence/A3D7B0DD621DE46CB6CC543F65A66F93) (this wasn't possible when the closures were written because we didn't support triply periodic domains, but is possible now). This could also be used to validate Anisotropic Minimum Dissipation. Here's a figure with such a comparison from [Rozema et al 2015](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4928700):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127508527-e5f7d150-56c4-4949-ad8e-90d67fdbee64.png). I believe for shear flows it has also been found that the constant needs to be as small as `C=0.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927:2726,test,test,2726,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"although a cleaner design might require a bit of refactoring. PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. ### Local topologies. The local grid topology may need to be different from the global/full grid topology. This isn't an issue for triply-periodic so I haven't thought about how to tackle it yet.

Testability,"ate this? I think a code example would be helpful with an explanation on what's being accomplished. Also can you explain why this can't be implemented with a Callback (or forcing function)? I.e., why do we desire this as a source code feature? Just to be clear, I'm not saying it should be one way or another, but it's good to have explicit justification for source code features (which are expensive to maintain and require resources to test)!. No problem at all, [heres](https://gist.github.com/jagoosw/213d7f2ce3707768d4ddb07f8827cdd2) an example (not sure where best to put this/if you'd want it in the examples folder). This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model. I also envisage using this to exert drag on the flow at some point. ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif). Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.

This means that our formula is identical to Pressel et al (2015), but the constant is wrong: Pressel proposes `Cs=0.17`, and we have a default of `Cs=0.23`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/32c5c5a2d0f441a4b663866d511807d0f9413c90/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/smagorinsky_lilly.jl#L63-L64. Amusingly, . ```julia; julia> 0.165 * sqrt(2); 0.23334523779156072; ```. which is probably not a coincidence. However, I'm not sure how an extra factor of `sqrt(2)` snuck into our constant. As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-si",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927:2080,test,test,2080,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927,1,['test'],['test']

The second time-step is when QuasiAdamsBashforth2 uses tendency information saved from the previous time-step. On the first time-step it's equivalent to a forward Euler scheme. I know the differences are small, 8th decimal place or so, but on such a coarse grid should we be expecting the same answers?. Hardware differences can produce results that differ by something like sqrt(eps(Float64)) I think. This is the tolerance we use for regression tests (but even those sometimes fail to pass on the GPU for some reason). Since the background buoyancy field has a linear gradient and your domain is bounded, can you try running the same simulation but explicitly resolving the background buoyancy field?

Testability,"ept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. ### Local topologies. The local grid topology may need to be different from the global/full grid topology. This isn't an issue for triply-periodic so I haven't thought about how to tackle it yet. How would topologies work for grids on a single rank (i.e. a piece of a larger grid)? Do we need a new `Communication` topology?. In the case of being `Periodic` on t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066:1304,test,testing,1304,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066,4,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"
Testability,"er: namely a channel flow forced by a pressure gradient, with a Monin-Obukhov-compliant bottom drag. I couldn't reproduce the simulation perfectly (for example, they use a pseudo-spectral scheme in the horizontal directions, force their drag with a horizontal average, and modify the `SmagLilly` constant slightly) so the results are a bit different from what's in their paper, but I think that's okay. Let me know if anyone thinks otherwise. Importantly, the `ScaleInvSmag` shows an improvement over the `SmagLilly`, with the later being expectedly overly diffusive and pretty much killing any turbulence at this resolution:. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6440450d-52f4-43ef-9ad5-0f8fcd9993d5. For reference, this is what similar plots from the paper look like (the equivalent for us here would be SMAG and PASI):. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5607d340-d4b4-4405-a0a6-67ed43bfd274). Some quick notes:. - Many tests are failing become I made an ad-hoc modification for now which passes the velocities to `DiffusivityFields()`. I did that because otherwise it was hard to make the model performant and simulations were taking way too long. We can (and should) review this and either come up with a better way to construct the `diffusivity_fields` or make this change separately in another PR, which will require changing the other models too.; - I'm updating the dynamic model once every 5 time steps only (this is user-defined). This is common practice for dynamic models since their cost is significantly higher than that of constant Smag or even AMD. With that practice, the dynamic model is taking about 3 times longer to run than the constant Smagorinsky. It does take significantly longer to compile (I haven't timed it). I believe there might be some optimizations still on the table though.; - I also found that the precise value of the Smag coefficient calculated via the dynamic procedure is dependent on the advection scheme, with WENO generally leading ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3642#issuecomment-2417879667:2146,test,tests,2146,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3642#issuecomment-2417879667,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"field to accept a list of callable objects or functions. Or even better, a list of objects that look something like. ```julia; struct PrintableDiagnostic{D}; diagnostic :: D; format :: String; name :: String; units :: String; end. function pretty_diagnostic(pd::PrintableDiagnostic, model); return @sprintf(""%s: $(pd.format) %s"", pd.name, pd.diagnostic(model), pd.units); end; ```. with this design, the user can pass a list of `PrintableDiagnostics` to `ProgressPrinter`, which are then evaluated and the results turned into a string via the function `pretty_diagnostic`. As for option 1 of using a logging package, perhaps it could be nice to use some logging functionality that's configurable with global variables (?) rather than manually creating a `ProgressPrinter` that does ""brute force"" printing as I have described above. However I think that it would require some customization of existing logging packages, since the typical `info` or `debug` settings are not sufficient for the purposes of logging simulation output (right?) Instead, we would need more options, and it'd be nice to obtain the ability to also print the output of diagnostics / monitoring functions, as we do in the example script. And I think doing it this way might involve adding some lines to our time stepping loop. Perhaps @ali-ramadhan has more to say. Another thing we have talked about is somehow having the ability to live-update messages in the terminal (rather than printing a stream of message). This would be nice because it could dramatically reduce the text-noise that a stream of messages invokes, allowing the user to much more easily read and interpret the output of a simulation progress (in addition to creating the possibility for nice pseudo-animations via `UnicodePlots.jl`). I'm not 100% sure how to do this; one places to start could be https://github.com/ronisbr/TextUserInterfaces.jl. Any work on any of these ideas could be useful!

Testability,"ggest leaving a caution statement on the simulation tips page. But I agree it has to be less strongly worded...; > ; > I'll try to provide a MWE that reproduces the behavior, but I'm currently having trouble getting my hands on some GPU, so I'm not sure how fast I can do that. Ok, no rush!. Trig functions aren't generically slower on GPUs than CPUs. On CPUs I think our code is fairly non-optimal right now, so various sources of overhead (eg non-optimal threading) can ""hide"" slow operations on the CPU. On the GPU we are more efficient, so overall speed might depend more sensitively on user code when it's injected. (I'd also argue that the beginning of this section is a bit misleading in how it claims we ""try to optimize"" internal source code. In fact, we have performed almost no performance optimization, and this is an important topic for future work.). I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU. The basic principle here is that _there is a trade-off_ between precomputing a potentially expensive operation, and performing it on-the-fly. For constants, precomputation is harmless. For arrays, on-the-fly computation has significant benefits, both for code readability and also possibly for performance (in memory-bound computations). Enlightening users on 1) the existence of this trade-off and 2) how to use benchmarking to find the optimal solution for their problem would probably be useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151:2427,benchmark,benchmarking,2427,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

Testability,"he problem. It only fails intermittently.; > ; > We have some validation of the shallow water model in the example. I propose that in order to move forward, we should generate a few additional validation tests including some with bathymetry. Once we have those and have analyzed them to ensure we are satisfied with the dynamics, we should then work on designing a better regression test --- one that won't ""pass"" when it should not. Then we can add that better regression test to our test suite, and remove the warning from the shallow water model constructor.; > ; > Probably best to also resolve the issue with the pressure gradient in presence of bathymetry. Maybe a topographic Rossby wave or some such would help build confidence that we are treating non-uniform bathymetry correctly with both of the formulations that we have. Thanks for the explanation. I agree that looking at a topographic Rossby wave is a good test to have. In the case of a small linear slope and small amplitude wave, it should be close to an exact solution so that will be easy. If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography. Not a simple test but would help to validate the global simulations that @simone-silvestri did a while ago with the shallow water model. Lots we can do!. I don't remember the issue about the pressure gradient term with bathymetry but happy to get into it sometime.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3050#issuecomment-1498158496:1178,test,tests,1178,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3050#issuecomment-1498158496,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"help a lot. Went from being 2.1x slower to being 1.3x slower. Still a significant slowdown considering that these forcing functions aren't as computationally demanding as the rest of the right-hand-side calculation. But good enough for me right now. It can be a very powerful feature (essentially replacing the MITgcm RBCS package, for one example) so would be good to get maximum performance out of the forcing functions. But it will probably always depend on exactly how you write them.

GPUArrays / CUDA include utilities for ""one-level"" wrapped arrays, ie `SubArray` / `view` of `CuArray`. But they do not include utilities for `OffsetArray` of GPU array (or heaven forbid, `OffsetArray` of `SubArray` of `CuArray`). So that commit supports experimental syntax for broadcasting with ""windowed fields"" which are created by `view`. It might only work with 3D windows (ie if a field is _not_ windowed in some direction it won't have expected behavior).

Testability,"iguration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise we cannot launch `mpiexec` with 4 tasks (1 for each GPU). It's helpful to have the maximum number of CPUs for precompilation. Otherwise precompilation is very slow. I also set. ```; export JULIA_NUM_PRECOMPILE_TASKS=64; ```. (half the total) --- adapt for your system. Here is also a small test script for debuggin Oceananigans:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; arch = Distributed(GPU()); @show arch; ```. as a side note, it would be nice if we could print to the screen from different ranks without them talking over one another. It makes it hard to read the output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436:2292,test,test,2292,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"in general. We currently handle this only during time-stepping --- there is no guarantee, for example, that the diffusivities or ghost cell values are consistent with the velocity field if the velocity field is set by the function `set!` (in fact, the diffusivities are *always* inconsistent with the current velocity field due to the fact that they are calculated *prior* to taking a time-step). If we want to guarantee such a consistency, we can develop the concept of a model ""state"" and apply it to both ocean and atmospheric models (eg a function `update_state!(model)`, or something similar). What does the jargon ""sounding"" mean?. Merger means we need to think carefully about how to reduce boilerplate to minimize (within reason) the cost of maintaining two parallel models as we develop their shared subcomponents. I wonder if splitting off the output writers and diagnostics into a `Simulation` type that wraps `AbstractModel` may help. In this paradigm, a ""Model"" is reduced to numerics + physics specification. This would be easy to implement (while I think an `Equation` abstraction would be relatively difficult due to myriad difficult design problems, including the abstraction of tuples of terms with heterogeneous function signatures, numerical aspects of the equation, implicit vs explicit treatment of terms, etc).; The `Simulation` type can then be used to ""run"" simulations over multiple time steps, eg. ```julia; simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.0, end_time=8day, output=output_writers, diagnostics=diagnostics); run!(simulation); ```. and is tasked with managing things like output writing, diagnostics calculation, adaptive time-stepping, and progress logging. Each `Model` then simply needs to define a function that performs a single time-step to interface with `Simulation`. This is discussed further in #447. Such a orthogonalization of the code means we can develop the `Simulation` abstraction without having to worry about updating each `AbstractModel` individually.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580279671:1997,log,logging,1997,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580279671,1,['log'],['logging']

This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model.

Testability,"les. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this. I'll start refactoring this PR using @glwagner's and @zhenwu0728's feedback, but I think it would be really great if we can keep this performance. # Benchmarks. ```; Oceananigans v0.44.1; Julia Version 1.5.2; Commit 539f3ce943 (2020-09-23 23:17 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-9.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); GPU: TITAN V; ```. ```; Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ N_particles │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 0 │ 361.749 ms │ 364.041 ms │ 364.293 ms │ 368.854 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ 1 │ 375.030 ms │ 376.591 ms │ 377.959 ms │ 385.248 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10 │ 377.251 ms │ 380.792 ms │ 387.560 ms │ 443.325 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100 │ 378.867 ms │ 381.194 ms │ 381.328 ms │ 383.461 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 1000 │ 378.076 ms │ 384.114 ms │ 383.611 ms │ 388.507 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10000 │ 381.209 ms │ 383.687 ms │ 387.584 ms │ 419.196 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100000 │ 389.478 ms │ 390.299 ms │ 390.442 ms │ 391.984 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 1000000 │ 484.920 ms │ 487.836 ms │ 488.382 ms │ 493.664 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10000000 │ 1.484 s │ 1.489 s │ 1.497 s │ 1.525 s │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100000000 │ 11.523 s │ 11.523 s │ 11.523 s │ 11.5",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975:1264,benchmark,benchmarks,1264,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

Testability,"losures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method. This is notoriously tricky, but we've made a lot of progress on this for the purposes of the ClimateMachine and it might be interesting to translate what we've learned into Oceananigans. There's also some minor package stuff that I want to work on, such as refactoring the output writer (#963), improving logging / feedback while oceananigans builds a model or runs a simulation (#1013), getting arrays with named axes to work (#457), and figuring out what's going wrong with models that have `Flat` dimensions (#1024). A more fun project is to come up with cool plotting recipes in 1D, 2D, and 3D (!) We'd like to show people how to use Makie (for example) to create really cool visualizations / animations of turbulence. The examples do some animation, but more complicated stuff (such as 3D contourf plots, or volume rendering) might require dedicated scripts. @navidcy and I have also discussed projects to implement 1) a shallow water model using Oceananigans functionality and 2) a quasi-geostrophic model in Oceananigans (which would use the tridiagonal solver I mentioned earlier). What else? The best project is probably one that aligns with you and your students' research... ?

Testability,"ltiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. ### Local topologies. The local grid topology may need to be different from the global/full grid topology. This isn't an issue for triply-periodic so I haven't thought about how to tackle it yet. How would topologies work for grids on a single rank (i.e. a piece of a larger grid)? Do we need a new `Communication` topology?. In the case of being `Periodic` on the left and communicating with another rank on the right, then it makes sense to be `Communication` on the left and right. But you could be `Bounded` on the left and communicating with ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066:1596,test,tested,1596,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066,1,['test'],['tested']

In this case, the information we decide to print is:. * iteration number `i`; * the simulation time `t`; * the time-step (because we are using adaptive time-stepping); * the maximum vertical velocity; * the elapsed wall time for time stepping *only* (not including plotting) between print messages. I think this issue is about a better way to achieve the printing of simulation progress. Two ideas are:. 1. Somehow use a logging package (though I'm not 100% what this would look like --- perhaps this means adding lines to our [time-stepping loop](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ca814dbe608487857c06a51a7383350dcf1e46f4/src/time_steppers.jl#L28)?; 2. Create some types that allow the user to more easily manage the printing of progress messages, expanding on the pattern used in our example. I've thought a bit about 2: I think a generic progress messenger would be both configurable but also include some comforting defaults. A simple way to start could be something like. ```julia; struct ProgressPrinter{DT, M, D}; Δt :: DT; model :: M; diagnostics :: D; end; ```. with some kind of print function, something like. ```julia; pretty_Δt(Δt::Number) = prettytime(Δt); pretty_Δt(Δt::TimeStepWizard) = prettytime(wizard.Δt). function Base.print(progress::ProgressMessenger); @printf(""i: %04d, t: %s, Δt: %s, ; progress.model.clock.iteration, prettytime(progress.model.clock.time), pretty_Δt(progress.Δt)) ; return nothing; end; ```.

Testability,"org/wiki/Atmospheric_sounding). From talking to @thabbott apparently it's pretty common to initialize a model using observational data obtained from e.g. a weather balloon. Apparently some models get pretty fancy and construct a hydrostatic base state from the sounding to avoid transient acoustic waves when running the model. > I wonder if splitting off the output writers and diagnostics into a `Simulation` type that wraps `AbstractModel` may help. Hmmm, I wasn't super into the idea of a new `Simulation` type before but with multiple model types it makes more sense and would simplify the `Model` type by moving out output writers and diagnostics. I still think we don't need a new type and can simply define a new function like; ```julia; run_model!(model, Δt=1.0, end_time=8day, output=output_writers, diagnostics=diagnostics); ```; which just needs `time_step!` to be defined. > Nice work with the test cases @ali-ramadhan! No objections to merging from me, but I think we should have a discussion (in person or in a separate issue) about ways to separate aspects of the model that make it an atmosphere vs. an ocean model from things that make it a compressible vs. incompressible model. Thanks! Hmmm, that's a good point that currently the `IncompressibleModel` is really more of an `OceanModel` as evidence by the `surface_waves` functionality and the `SeawaterBuoyancy` default. And the proposed `CompressibleModel` is already more of an `AtmosphericModel` as tracers representing mixing ratios like ql, qv, qi, etc. are given special treatment (they contribute to the moist density). > The Boussinesq solver in Oceananigans is already useful for atmospheric simulations with depths small relative to a scale height and could be great for cloud modeling if there's any easy way to convert it to an anelastic solver. My understanding (maybe @jm-c or someone else can confirm for the MITgcm) is that the current Boussinesq solver can be repurposed for anelastic simulations but it would hav",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580555155:2764,test,test,2764,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/605#issuecomment-580555155,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"pe and type of A. (The first two arguments have the same meaning as for fft.) Returns an object P which; represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains all of the information needed to compute fft(A, dims) quickly. To apply P to an array A, use P * A; in general, the syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices. (A plan can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the A for which; the plan was created.) You can also apply a plan with a preallocated output array Â by calling mul!(Â, plan, A). (For mul!, however, the input array A must be a complex floating-point; array like the output Â.) You can compute the inverse-transform plan by inv(P) and apply the inverse plan with P \ Â (the inverse plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls to inv or; \), and apply the inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array A with ldiv!(A, P, Â). The flags argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags, defaulting to FFTW.ESTIMATE. e.g. passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking; different possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner flags. The optional timelimit argument specifies a rough upper bound on; the allowed planning time, in seconds. Passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT may cause the input array A to be overwritten with zeros during plan creation. plan_fft! is the same as plan_fft but creates a plan that operates in-place on its argument (which must be an array of complex floating-point numbers). plan_ifft and so on are similar; but produce plans that perform the equivalent of the inverse transforms ifft and so on. help?> plan_fft!; search: plan_fft! plan_ifft! plan_bfft! plan_fft plan_rfft plan_ifft plan_bfft plan_irfft plan_brfft. plan_fft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE, timelimit=Inf).

This is clearer, and will give you the correct value even if you change the grid in the future. Note that in the call to `zspacing()` above, we need to specify the x, y and z positions to get the spacing, but in a `RectilinearGrid` Δz is constant in x and y so those arguments don't really matter. Also note that the code above is written for the most recent Oceananigans version (for which you'll need Julia 1.9). 3. Now to your main point (sorry for the tangents! :grimacing:), I don't see anything obviously wrong with the code. Just from looking at it, it looks like it _should_ work. (Btw, when I say that, I assume this is a _only snippet, and not the full-code_, since I get errors when I try to run your code (`coriolis`, `T_bcs` and `S_bcs` aren't defined, `Fx` looks like it'd cause an error, etc.), so I haven't been able to properly run and test your snippet.). That said, there are things I personally would try:; - Have you tried better resolving the model? A 64^3 model _should_ be able to achieve a log-law, but it's still worth investigating.; - Have you tried using the `SmagorinskyLilly` closure? I've had some issues with AMD in the past (although not exactly the same as yours), and I remember @glwagner mentioning having an issue with AMD near boundaries that could explain the behavior you're seeing.; - Finally, I'd suggest starting with a very simple model first for debugging/investigating. Just the bare minimum to reproduce a log-law.

One could then expand on this design by setting up the `diagnostics` field to accept a list of callable objects or functions. Or even better, a list of objects that look something like. ```julia; struct PrintableDiagnostic{D}; diagnostic :: D; format :: String; name :: String; units :: String; end. function pretty_diagnostic(pd::PrintableDiagnostic, model); return @sprintf(""%s: $(pd.format) %s"", pd.name, pd.diagnostic(model), pd.units); end; ```. with this design, the user can pass a list of `PrintableDiagnostics` to `ProgressPrinter`, which are then evaluated and the results turned into a string via the function `pretty_diagnostic`. As for option 1 of using a logging package, perhaps it could be nice to use some logging functionality that's configurable with global variables (?) rather than manually creating a `ProgressPrinter` that does ""brute force"" printing as I have described above. However I think that it would require some customization of existing logging packages, since the typical `info` or `debug` settings are not sufficient for the purposes of logging simulation output (right?) Instead, we would need more options, and it'd be nice to obtain the ability to also print the output of diagnostics / monitoring functions, as we do in the example script. And I think doing it this way might involve adding some lines to our time stepping loop. Perhaps @ali-ramadhan has more to say. Another thing we have talked about is somehow having the ability to live-update messages in the terminal (rather than printing a stream of message). This would be nice because it could dramatically reduce the text-noise that a stream of messages invokes, allowing the user to much more easily read and interpret the output of a simulation progress (in addition to ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/71#issuecomment-540828221:3182,log,logging,3182,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/71#issuecomment-540828221,2,['log'],['logging']
Testability,"rtically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method. This is notoriously tricky, but we've made a lot of progress on this for the purposes of the ClimateMachine and it might be interesting to translate what we've learned into Oceananigans. There's also some minor package stuff that I want to work on, such as refactoring the output writer (#963), improving logging / feedback while oceananigans builds a model or runs a simulation (#1013), getting arrays with named axes to work (#457), and figuring out what's going wrong with models that have `Flat` dimensions (#1024). A more fun project is to come up with cool plotting recipes in 1D, 2D, and 3D (!) We'd like to show people how to use Makie (for example) to create really cool visualizations / animations of turbulence.

Testability,"s (like the models implemented in OceanBioME) to ""opt-in"" to a substepping scheme. In this design, there's no need to change the existing ""slow"" kernels I don't think. However, we could consider changing the name of them. For example, all that's needed is for the _implementation_ to know when to return a slow source term vs fast source term. > this is where I had to make some more changes to the existing code (and probably the messiest part of what I did), because the code often expects the tendencies to live at timestepper.G / $G^-$, so I made functions that dispatched on the timestepper and usually returned that, but for the new timestepepr returned timestepper.physics.G etc. I'm not sure that new tendencies are needed for substepping. The substepping scheme for CATKE manages to avoid allocating any additional tendencies by preserving the ""slow"" source term:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivities/time_step_catke_equation.jl#L167-L171. The only change that is needed within Oceananigans (in principle) --- as far as I can tell --- is to skip the tracer update for certain tracers (like we do for CATKE and TKEDissipation):. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/hydrostatic_free_surface_ab2_step.jl#L78-L85. Then the implementer of the BGC model has to perform the substepping inside `update_biogeochemical_state!`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/update_hydrostatic_free_surface_model_state.jl#L49. Possibly we can go further and define an interface that does the substepping automatically though.

Hard to say whether it's noise, it might be more due to other processes causing small variations in runtime. To me I don't think this PR slows down or speeds up the code, but it simplifies and improves the time stepping code so it should be merged. There's a few more memory allocations now (due to extra kernel launches) but this shouldn't affect performance. # System info. ```; Oceananigans v0.44.1; Julia Version 1.5.2; Commit 539f3ce943 (2020-09-23 23:17 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-9.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); GPU: TITAN V; ```. # Master branch; ```; Incompressible model benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬─────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ Float_types │ Ns │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼─────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 32 │ 5.399 ms │ 5.668 ms │ 5.758 ms │ 7.186 ms │ 242.42 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 64 │ 36.710 ms │ 37.583 ms │ 37.974 ms │ 41.678 ms │ 242.42 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 128 │ 312.780 ms │ 313.477 ms │ 313.622 ms │ 314.726 ms │ 242.42 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 256 │ 2.802 s │ 2.819 s │ 2.819 s │ 2.836 s │ 242.42 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 32 │ 5.828 ms │ 6.049 ms │ 6.157 ms │ 7.044 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 64 │ 43.084 ms │ 43.619 ms │ 43.650 ms │ 44.363 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 128 │ 365.051 ms │ 365.317 ms │ 365.475 ms │ 366.288 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 256 │ 3.602 s │ 3.653 s │ 3.653 s │ 3.703 s │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ GPU │ Float32 │ 32 │ 2.797 ms │ 2.870 ms │ 2.918 ms │ 3.435 ms │ 802.70 KiB │ 11419 │; │ GPU │ Float32 │",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1210#issuecomment-736692263:912,benchmark,benchmarks,912,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1210#issuecomment-736692263,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']
Testability,"th the `ScaleInvSmag`. I'm also plotting the value of the Smagorinsky constant from the dynamic model. For similar conditions (3D homogeneous tubrulence), Lilly assumed a sharp spectral filter in the inertial subrange, matched the SGS dissipation rate to the TKE dissipation rate and obtained the theoretical value of the Smag constant of $c_s$ ≈ 0.165. I think these assumptions should be roughly valid in this validation script, and indeed the value that we obtain for $c_s$ is kinda close:. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f210d18b-82bf-4e9e-bb26-58bbd4251820. Although to be honest I expected the value to be closer. That said, I believe Lilly also assumed a _stationary_ turbulent flow (although I'd have to double check that), which is not the case here and may be affecting the coefficient value. Btw, I had posted a similar video before but I made some modifications to the model since then. I also reproduced the first test simulation in the original Bou-Zeid (2005) paper: namely a channel flow forced by a pressure gradient, with a Monin-Obukhov-compliant bottom drag. I couldn't reproduce the simulation perfectly (for example, they use a pseudo-spectral scheme in the horizontal directions, force their drag with a horizontal average, and modify the `SmagLilly` constant slightly) so the results are a bit different from what's in their paper, but I think that's okay. Let me know if anyone thinks otherwise. Importantly, the `ScaleInvSmag` shows an improvement over the `SmagLilly`, with the later being expectedly overly diffusive and pretty much killing any turbulence at this resolution:. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6440450d-52f4-43ef-9ad5-0f8fcd9993d5. For reference, this is what similar plots from the paper look like (the equivalent for us here would be SMAG and PASI):. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5607d340-d4b4-4405-a0a6-67ed43bfd274).

I see two solutions here:; 1) change the constructor of `MultiRegionGrid` to make sure that fill_halo is called outside, aka partition the immersed_boundary outside the `construct_regionally`, fill_halo and then build the immersed grid with an offsetarray (simple but probably worst long term); 2) Make `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` wrap around `MultiRegionGrid`(slightly more complex, maybe for another PR, but probably useful for the cubed sphere grid?)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3122#issuecomment-1603029063:778,test,test,778,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3122#issuecomment-1603029063,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ue to a finite time step. It's important to recognize that the dynamics of the _discrete_ linear equations are different than the continuous. When we have a smooth solution, such that our spatial discretization should approximate some exact smooth solution, we can test that refining the grid and time step leads to convergence to an exact solution. Moreover, we can estimate the time-scale of the dynamics using the time-scales of the smooth dynamics as a guide. An example is a resolved buoyancy oscillation: it has a timescale of roughly 1/N. This example is dominated by small amplitude (eg linear) noise at the grid scale. Therefore my initial time scale estimate of 1/N may not hold. Instead, we'd have to look at the discrete eigenvalues of the system at the very higheset wavenumbers (ie the Nyquist number 2pi / dx). We could then calculate the time-step that would be required to resolve these (completely unphysical) dynamics. I'm not sure what a lower bound on such spurious discrete dynamics might be. It could be far smaller than any physical time scale, ie as small as 1e-16, or smaller? Perhaps the evolution of grid scale noise also has to do with spatial resolution, so that could be another knob to vary. So if we want to investigate this further, we should conduct a systematic study of the dynamics of this grid-scale noise system affected by buoyancy, decreasing the time-step to zero. Or we can convince ourselves that non-noisy dynamics _are_ accurate --- eg by analyzing a system like the one we use for our ""internal wave"" dynamics test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/test/test_internal_wave_dynamics.jl. that test verifies that a wave packet in our code propagates at the correct group speed, for example. But one could dive much deeper into that example and test a wide variety of wave numbers. It depends whether you are interested in the grid-scale noise system, or whether you are interested in verifying that smooth resolved dynamics are correct.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2935#issuecomment-1444451423:1787,test,test,1787,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2935#issuecomment-1444451423,4,['test'],['test']
Testability,"uggest leaving a caution statement on the simulation tips page. But I agree it has to be less strongly worded...; > ; > I'll try to provide a MWE that reproduces the behavior, but I'm currently having trouble getting my hands on some GPU, so I'm not sure how fast I can do that. Ok, no rush!. Trig functions aren't generically slower on GPUs than CPUs. On CPUs I think our code is fairly non-optimal right now, so various sources of overhead (eg non-optimal threading) can ""hide"" slow operations on the CPU. On the GPU we are more efficient, so overall speed might depend more sensitively on user code when it's injected. (I'd also argue that the beginning of this section is a bit misleading in how it claims we ""try to optimize"" internal source code. In fact, we have performed almost no performance optimization, and this is an important topic for future work.). I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU. The basic principle here is that _there is a trade-off_ between precomputing a potentially expensive operation, and performing it on-the-fly. For constants, precomputation is harmless. For arrays, on-the-fly computation has significant benefits, both for code readability and also possibly for performance (in memory-bound computations). Enlightening users on 1) the existence of this trade-off and 2) how to use benchmarking to find the optimal solution for their problem would probably be useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151:1507,benchmark,benchmark-of-various-math-operations,1507,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark-of-various-math-operations']

Testability,"ure out a clean way of integrating `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` with the existing time-stepping. Perhaps we just need a `maybe_fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` function that only does something on a connected cubed sphere. 4. We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. 9. Figure out a way to abstract and clean up `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` and `fill_*_halo!`... 10. Merge utils from `src/CubedSpheres/cubed_sphere_utils.jl` and `src/Distributed/distributed_utils.jl` into `Oceananigans.Grids`. 11. Figure out if the tests in `test_cubed_sphere_halo_exchange.jl` can be abstracted and run for all six faces. It's tedious to have to type them out but could be clearer and easier to debug in its current form... 12. Fix tests!. 13. I think cubed sphere performance can be improved, especially for halo filling.

I know of a form of the harmonic case that is positive preserving and we could include that. But does anyone case about those levels of details? If yes I can include the form in the writeup and even a short derivation of how to get it from the 3D equations.; 4. @glwagner pointed out that `ShallowWaterModel` is very separate from everything else in Oceananigans and that is a bit of a pain to maintain. One advantage of a `VectorInvariant` form is that it could rely heavily on `HydrostaticModel`, that way they grow together. It might even ben an embarassingly simply application.; 5. I would like there to be a switch from free-surface to rigid-lid. In the latter we have to solve an elliptic problem, and again probably easier with a `VectorInvariant` form but probably not difficult with a conservative form either. How do people suggest this would work?; 6. I would like to have both `VectorInvariant` and `Conservative` forms. Each has their advantages and if you wanted to know if your results were robust, you could try both and if they give you the same result then you would have confidence in your results. But maybe people would think this is too much effort to maintain?. As for the utility of the shallow water model, I would like to get some students using it in Oceananigans to study oceanographic problems, and if we wanted to include coastlines I think we could do this using the `VectorInvariant` form but not the `Conservative` form. I don't expect this will be of huge demand, but it is also be useful for pedagogical reasons, for students learning about GFD and oceanography. I also think it's a nice way to test advection schemes as with the free-surface version we don't have to solve for the pressure, so it's simpler. I am of course very interested as to what others think about these issues as well.

I think this last plot provides us with a clue since the averages start at the right value, but the oscillations get dampened as time progresses. This may indicate that the average is being done with a window much bigger than the averaging period for some reason.

Usability," ; > We can explain this all in words, but I thought the approx is _visual_ which is helpful. Even just scanning the document you see, this equation involves an _approximation_. The approx is, in fact, a more precise and correct representation of the problem. We can in fact regard the power method algorithm as predicated on a hypothesis (not an exact theory), which we provide empirical evidence for. This is one of the advantages of the power method that uses the full original system, I think, over more brute force approaches that forcefully remove nonlinear terms.; > ; > It is possible to replace the approx with an `=` and also include all of the nonlinear terms what one would get from the manipulations that lead to the equation for `Phi`. This is precisely what you would do if you were interested in continuing the asymptotic expansion _that linearization implies_ to investigate things like saturation, etc. So there's also a neat pedagogical power in the approx symbol in that it provides a hint for further learning and exploration of the mathematics of the system. I agree with **all** of the above. However, you missed one of my points... my disagreement was mostly of the phrasing. You suggested writing:. > Linear instabilities such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, are described by equations of the form ∂_t Φ + L Φ ≈ 0 ... This statement is wrong --- that was my only objection. When accompanied with the messages you posted above it makes absolutely sense! But would you expect users to infer all these just from the ≈ symbol?. Reading your post made me think. I now suggest the following restructure (I'll present here a skeleton). - first discuss linear instabilities... the fact that Oceananigans.jl won't give you the linear operator but will evolve the full nonlinear system and the ""hack"" to get _approximately linear dynamics_ (I'll use ≈ here ;)) by utilizing `BackgroundFields`+**small amplitude**; - next discuss how we do eigenanalysis of the linear operator (wit",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1125#issuecomment-720166282:1659,learn,learning,1659,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1125#issuecomment-720166282,1,['learn'],['learning']

Usability," > ; > The thing is that `BetaPlane` is also a ""rectilinear Coriolis"" since it's a Coriolis implementation meant for rectilinear grids, no? I'm not very familiar with the implementation of the Coriolis acc in spherical grids, but if I understand correctly you can't use `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` on spherical grids?; > ; > If that's true, maybe we aim for consistency with the rectilinear grids for now and rename things to; > ; > * `RectilinearGridFPlane` (this one); > * `RectilinearGridBetaPlane` (what is now `BetaPlane`); > * Keep `FPlane` for now because, like you said, it's an easy name that's very commonly used; > ; > I do think that it's important to keep ""f-plane"" in the name of this implementation somewhere instead of just ""Coriolis"" because there are different approximations one can make when implementing the Coriolis acc, so it'd help to be specific. The f-plane refers to a tangent plane approximation for a fluid contained in a spherical shell. However, this type is more general than that case (this was also a problem with the undecorated `FPlane` type), and can be used to model any rotating fluid in a rectilinear domain with an arbitrary axis of rotation. Therefore, I argue not using `FPlane` in the name of this type. `BetaPlane` has no meaning outside of rectilinear geometries, therefore I propose not adding the superfluous `RectilinearGrid` in front of `BetaPlane`. As for `Grid` or not, the meaning of `RectilinearGrid` is specific to Oceananigans. However, the term ""rectilinear"" has a distinct meaning apart from ""grids"". Here, I think its clear if the name refers to the coordinate system (rather than the grid or mesh), I think I prefer simply ""RectilinearCoriolis"". Otherwise, we will also need to consider how to devise a similar name for ""HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis"" that somehow references the handful of grid types that we permit for in spherical domains. That said, RectilinearCoriolis is not perfect (its obscure), so I think there is room for improvement.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887649059:1959,clear,clear,1959,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887649059,2,"['clear', 'simpl']","['clear', 'simply']"

Are you sure? For immersed boundaries, this would mean that all the metrics must be 3D arrays even when the grid directions are separable --- greatly inflating the size of your output file. > Or maybe there's a way to use abstract operation metrics to do this that I'm not aware?. It is simple. Write a `KernelFunctionOperation` that checks if a node is `peripheral_node`. If `true`, divide the metric by 2, otherwise, return the metric unchanged. However, as noted above, I'm not sure this is what you want. Perhaps there is a purpose to the convention that divides the cell sizes on the boundary by 2. However, I'm worried this could be misleading regarding how the staggered finite volume grid and its diagnostics are interpreted. Another concern is that modifying metrics prior to output will lead to difficulties in reproducible diagnostics in the future between xgcm computations and native Oceanangians computations.

Usability," `y` is north-south).; > ; > Thanks for the suggestion. That was kind of the API for `NonTradFPlane`. I actually think three modes is kinda overkill and it makes the constructor function unnecessarily complicated (which is why I simplified it this time), especially since it's really not hard to calculate one mode from another one. I'd suggest keeping two of them as a compromise: ""general rotation"" (to match the API in `Buoyancy`) and ""tangent plane"". What do you think?; > ; > > I think `GeneralFPlane` is ambiguous, so I propose using a more specific name.; > ; > I completely agree. I used `GeneralFPlane` more as placeholder. But as you pointed out in #1372, `ConstantBackgroundRotation` is also kinda ambiguous since every rotation we have is technically a constant background rotation at its core. How about get descriptive and call it `ArbitraryAxisFPlane`?. I made my suggestion because I disagree that supporting those keyword arguments is overkill. I am arguing that the complexity of the constructor is justified because. 1) not supporting this API moves part of the ""complexity"" from the constructor into user scripts, which is very undesirable in general; 2) having a consistent API with `FPlane` and `BetaPlane` (which both support a `latitude` keyword argument) is important; 3) I think it really is a useful and friendly simplification to abstract the projection of the rotation axis into a plane tangent with a spherical surface (I have personally benefited from this abstraction for setting up examples like the one proposed in #1744, which I feel implies that many other users will also benefit). As for a name, maybe `RectilinearCoriolis`? This contrasts with `BetaPlane`, which is specific to rectilinear grids but isn't a constant background rotation rate, and `HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis`, which is for hydrostatic fluids in spherical shells. `FPlane` overlaps but we can concede this point because it's so common (and perhaps discuss eliminating `FPlane` in a future PR).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887606452:1787,simpl,simplification,1787,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887606452,1,['simpl'],['simplification']
Usability," factor of `sqrt(2)` snuck into our constant. As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-signals-in-gridgenerated-isotropic-turbulence/A3D7B0DD621DE46CB6CC543F65A66F93) (this wasn't possible when the closures were written because we didn't support triply periodic domains, but is possible now). This could also be used to validate Anisotropic Minimum Dissipation. Here's a figure with such a comparison from [Rozema et al 2015](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4928700):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127508527-e5f7d150-56c4-4949-ad8e-90d67fdbee64.png). I believe for shear flows it has also been found that the constant needs to be as small as `C=0.1` or smaller? It'd be nice to mention and cite these in the docstring as well, if we can find those references.

Usability," get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method. This is notoriously tricky, but we've made a lot of progress on this for the purposes of the ClimateMachine and it might be interesting to translate what we've learned into Oceananigans. There's also some minor package stuff that I want to work on, such as refactoring the output writer (#963), improving logging / feedback while oceananigans builds a model or runs a simulation (#1013), getting arrays with named axes to work (#457), and figuring out what's going wrong with models that have `Flat` dimensions (#1024). A more fun project is to come up with cool plotting recipes in 1D, 2D, and 3D (!) We'd like to show people how to use Makie (for example) to create really cool visualizations / animations of turbulence. The examples do some animation, but more complicated stuff (such as 3D contourf plots, or volume rendering) might require dedicated scripts. @navidcy and I have also discussed projects to implement 1) a shallow water model using Oceananigans functionality and 2) a quasi-geostrophic model in Oceananigans (which would use the tridiagonal solver I mentioned earlier).

Usability," get this feature is to refactor the output writers to have a more generic interface for splitting. If we have a property called `file_splitting` that _is_ a schedule, then we can write. ```julia; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs; file_splitting = TimeInterval(30days), ...); ```. Then the decision about whether to start a new file will change from. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L275. to. ```julia; writer.file_splitting(model) && start_next_file(model, writer) ; ```. Next, you will have to add a new schedule in `Utils/schedules.jl` that can split based on filesize:. ```julia; mutable struct FileSizeLargerThan <: AbstractSchedule; max_filesize :: Float64; path :: String; end. (fslt::FileSizeLargerThan)(model) = filesize(fslt.path) >= fslt.max_filesize; ```. Finally, you need to add a user interface for initializing and modifying the schedules to smooth out the user experience (for example, we don't want users to have to specify the file path more than once, and the file path that is checked by the schedule has to be updated). This will have to take two parts. In `Utils/schedules.jl`, a constructor:. ```julia; FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize) = FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize, """"); ```.

Usability," locations that are on or external to the immersed domain, but _not_ external to the underlying grid domain (we need this so that we don't apply immersed boundary conditions at all peripheral nodes).; - `immersed_cell` is now the name of the function `is_immersed` --- immersed boundary implementations define this to obtain correct logic for boundary conditions. We then extend `external_cell` to cover both the external cells of the underlying bounded domain and the immersed cells. I think there's still a fair amount of work to do on this interface but hopefully this is a good step forward. Here's a few more thoughts:. * It seems that we should really use `Bounded` topology to be synonymous with ""impenetrable"". This might help us disentangle a few issues (eg satisfying impenetrability, correct divergences, etc.) I think we are discovering that in some cases its better to hard code certain ""assumed boundary conditions"" directly into operators, such as impenetrable conditions (considering complex domains is the key to realize the right abstractions here, since there are many simple solutions for non-complex domains and no obvious way to distinguish their tradeoffs). This means that we need to ""assume"" boundary conditions based on grid topology (information centralized on the grid), rather than requiring knowledge of the field boundary conditions (information scattered throughout the fields); * Related to the above, when we support ""open"" boundaries, I think we may actually want an ""Open"" topology that functions similarly to the topologies we use for distributed models work (perhaps, in fact, we can reuse those abstractions). I think the design assumed (though it was never implemented) that we could use ""open boundary condition"" for open boundaries, rather than changing the topology. But with complex domains, it's helpful to _assume_ certain boundary conditions based on _grid topology_ (rather than boundary conditions applied to fields).

Usability," same grid wrapped around an `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` on `main`, when calling `zspacings()` we get the error at the top comment (`MethodError: no method matching`; which this PR aims to fix). The call to `zspacing()` works the same way as with `RectilinearGrid`, with the exception of an extra dispatch [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56fc69bcb08623424afe25e39ae616c29208095e/src/ImmersedBoundaries/immersed_grid_metrics.jl#L16-L31). ---. ### Summary of the PR as of this post. This PR is originally trying to fix the issue with `zspacings(::IBG)` simply by adding. ```julia; zspacings(grid::IBG, args...; kwargs...) = zspacings(grid.underlying_grid, args...; kwargs...); ```. If I understand correctly, @glwagner's point is that this is wrong in cases where cells have a fraction of ""wet"" volume and a fraction of ""immersed solid"" volume. (For now the two such cases in sight are `PartialCellBottom` and `CutCellBottom` (for which there's open PR https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3146).). Again, if I understand correctly, the simple solution would be to redirect `zspacings()` calls to. 1. Create a `KernelFunctionOperation` using `zspacing()`, which we know has the correct behavior for all cases; 2. Calculate and collect the values in a Array; 3. Return to user. The main challenge here (imo) is that . - if we wanna keep the user-interface simple (e.g. return a float or a 1D array from calls to `zspacings(::RectilinearGrid)` instead of a `Field` or a 3D array), then we lose consistency (because in the general case a call to `zspacings(::ImmersedBoundaryGrid)` _must_ return a 3D array (or `Field`, or `AbstractOp`...)).; - if we wanna keep the user-interface consistent (i.e. always return the same type of object) then we lose on simplicity (e.g. a call to `zspacings(::RectilinearGrid)` would always return _something_ 3D, even if the grid is regular). @navidcy @glwagner is this a fair assessment of the situation?

Usability," tracers: b; ├── closure: ScalarDiffusivity{ExplicitTimeDiscretization}(ν=BinaryOperation at (Center, Center, Center), κ=(b=UnaryOperation at (Center, Center, Center),)); ├── buoyancy: BuoyancyTracer with -ĝ = ZDirection; └── coriolis: Nothing; ```. note the type of `model.closure`. (Also note this doesn't work with `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` apparently... we need to fix that.). One downside of this method is that it precludes `VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization()`: because we use a predictor-corrector method for implicit time discretization, diffusivities that are treated implicitly _must_ be precomputed. ## Subtleties. There's more. There are subtleties peculiar to using `Ri` in a closure, because `Ri` easily becomes NaN when both the buoyancy gradient and shear are zero. The usual solution to this for ocean modeling is to use the ""hack"" that 0/0 = 0. In other words, NaNs are intercepted and set to 0. There are again a few solutions to this. One is simply to set all `NaN` to zero in side the function that computes `Ri`, eg. ```julia; u, v, w = model.velocities; b = model.tracers.b; Ri_op = @at (Center, Center, Center) ∂z(b) / (∂z(u)^2 + ∂z(v)^2). """""" Compute the Richardson number and store in `Ri`. """"""; function compute_Ri!(sim); Ri .= Ri_op. # Zero out NaNs; Ri_parent = parent(Ri); parent(Ri_parent)[isnan.(Ri_parent)] .= 0. fill_halo_regions!(Ri, sim.model.architecture); return nothing; end; ```. Other possibilities are 1) use `ConditionalOperation` to intercept `0/0` and set them to 0 _during_ the `Ri` computation (I don't have the code for that off the top of my head so I'll have to look into it and post later) or 2) write a kernel function (this requires using more primitive operators than `AbstractOperations`, and also being careful about staggered grid locations) to use with `KernelFunctionOperation` that does the necessary checking. There's a lot of great examples of how to use `KernelFunctionOperation` here: https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1065995186:4169,simpl,simply,4169,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1065995186,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability,"""regridding"" is conservative, ie the volume integral of the target field should be the same as the source field. However because of that, we can only regrid in one direction at a time right now. If you want to regrid in multiple directions, you need to form intermediate fields. General conservative is actually possible, just a bit more difficult. `interpolate!` does not conserve global integrals. It's just simple linear interpolation. Usually `interpolate!` is good enough.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3460#issuecomment-1946394580:410,simpl,simple,410,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3460#issuecomment-1946394580,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"# Progress update. I decided to take a stab at the simplest case: triply-periodic on the CPU. Surprisingly I was able to get a distributed `IncompressibleModel` running just using multiple dispatch without having to modify any existing code, although a cleaner design might require a bit of refactoring. PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066:51,simpl,simplest,51,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066,1,['simpl'],['simplest']

Usability,"**Can we use advection for mass evolution equation?**. Let me try and convince you that using advection for continuity makes sense. If I don't succeed then clearly I need to put more thought into it. The governing equation can be written in two forms; $$; \partial_t = -\partial_x (h u) - \partial_y (h v) = - \partial_x U - \partial_y V ; $$; If we were to solve this in terms of the velocities (u,v), then using advection is clearly a good idea as we are advecting h by the velocity. In the case of upwinding, we pick the direction based on the sign of u (or v). We are using the transports instead of velocities but it is very similar to the advection of a tracer $\nabla \cdot (u c)$ except that we use c = 1. Given that the physics is the same in both cases, I think we should be using the advection scheme for this term. . The evolution equations for h and c have a lot in common, which is helpful here. The one major difference is that h is an active tracer in the sense that it feeds back on the momentum. Even though that's the case, I don't think this should affect how we discretize the advection of h, even though it is disguesed with our use of the transport variable. If you agree with my reasoning I don't think we need to do anything different for the evolution of height equation, we might just need to have some new functions that account for this, which are essentially equivalent to c = 0. Maybe what you suggest is the way to proceed?. **High Order Finite Volume**. I agree that keeping things finite volume is a good idea, and that is how I would like to proceed. Good to know that IncompressibleModel won't generalize to higher order. I agree that the 4th-order pieces are there and just need to be assembled. The paper you cited above is very helpful but needs to be modified slightly as they present the method for a non-staggered grid, but ours is staggered. That is not problem, I just need to work through the details. Unless they have been done already?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-744478924:156,clear,clearly,156,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-744478924,2,['clear'],['clearly']
Usability,"**Final Commit Details**. Remove 4/3 factor, && --> &, ζ=NaN where undefined. 1. Remove 4/3 Factor in Vorticity Computation: The 4/3 factor was initially introduced in the vorticity calculation at the corners because the area used to divide the circulation (in the denominator) was reduced to three-quarters of its original value. However, it turns out that by adopting the Haversine formula for calculating the quadrilateral area on a sphere---which simplifies to a triangle when two points coincide---the 4/3 factor is inherently accounted for. Therefore, the explicit inclusion of this factor is no longer necessary. 2. Replace Short-Circuiting && with Logical &: Changed the short-circuiting && operator to the logical & operator to ensure compatibility with GPU operations. 3. Set Circulation Γ and Vorticity ζ to NaN when Undefined: Updated the code to assign NaN (Not a Number) to circulation Γ and vorticity ζ in cases where they are undefined. @glwagner, @navidcy, could one of you please review this PR once the tests pass, so I can proceed with merging?

Usability,". But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction. But as noted in this PR, this is not enough to fix issues with the immersed boundary MWE... but whether or not that is because of problems with the setup itself, I'm not sure... - All of that said, taking @tomchor suggestion to be more careful in updating the clock for RK3 actually does solve the MWE here. Obviously, this is again addressing the (in principle not entirely solvable) issue of error accumulation in `clock.time`, rather than addressing the other issue with very small time-steps producing an ill-posed pressure correction. I think we should fix RK3 separately, basically because we cannot completely avoid accumulating error in `clock.time`, every little thing we do to make it more accurate is a good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136:1822,simpl,simply,1822,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136,2,['simpl'],"['simple', 'simply']"

You can definitely take nicer/fancier approaches that scale much more easily (@glwagner mentioned a few options), but I feel like this is very simple to understand and can be scaled up to a list of outputs reasonably easily; you just gotta create the list of coarsened outputs based on the original list of outputs and interpolate the list in the `Callback`. @iuryt is this good enough for your purposes?. Also a quick note: if you want outputs at levels that aren't equally spaced from each other, you can set-up `coarse_grid` using an array of depths as the vertical coordinate.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3460#issuecomment-2090846777:2105,simpl,simple,2105,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3460#issuecomment-2090846777,1,['simpl'],['simple']

One key difference with `SubArray` is that we want to offset indices. For example with `SubArray` we have. ```julia; julia> b[1, 1, 1]; 0.5750957798298579. julia> a[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. But I think we instead want offset indices that behave something like. ```julia; julia> c = OffsetArray(view(a, :, 2:3, 2:2), 0, 1, 1); 3×2×1 OffsetArray(view(::Array{Float64, 3}, :, 2:3, 2:2), 1:3, 2:3, 2:2) with eltype Float64 with indices 1:3×2:3×2:2:; [:, :, 2] =; 0.575096 0.631413; 0.479499 0.0708911; 0.979659 0.117883. julia> c[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. So the indices for `c` and `a` are identical. Something also seems a bit clearer: when we are computing on fields with `indices`, we compute index ""intersections"" to figure out the range of the computation. For example if we want to compute something like. ```julia; u * η; ```. right now our infrastructure would assume this is a 3D computation defined at every level. But what we probably want is to return an object that just computes `u * η` at the _surface_. This will work if `η.indices = (:, :, Nz:Nz)` for example; then the product `u * η` is also defined over the indices `(:, :, Nz:Nz)`. We can also use this feature to support `FieldTimeSeries` of sliced output. If we use this then a `Nothing` location is truly _reduced_, ie, the field has no location in the reduced direction. But a field like the free surface displacement is not reduced; it's `IndexedField` (or something), with `!isnothing(η.indices)`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1029994350:1540,clear,clearer,1540,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1029994350,1,['clear'],['clearer']

Usability,"> (There is some inefficiency in the code that I did the wind and wall stress separately, even though they're basically the same thing, but a kind of merge of how I did each would probably be the most general way todo it because I put more work into the wind stress and just have the very simple flat bottomed law of the wall wall stress. Do you mean computational inefficiency, or inefficiency in terms of code length? For flat surfaces, we've designed an interface in ClimaOcean that depends on a roughness length callable object. This allows one to implement new models for the roughness length (which limit to wavy surface or smooth walls, combinations of the two, or other models). More generally our intent is definitely to encapsulate the parts that are not worth repeating elsewhere, and let users / external packages proliferate to do the interesting parts like designing new roughness lengths. Was that your vision too?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3807#issuecomment-2386534371:289,simpl,simple,289,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3807#issuecomment-2386534371,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"> (this is how PISCES implements a lot of the growth to prevent repetitive calculation of the same values, I don't know if this would be faster in this setting without testing but just as an example). I agree that we need this feature, but from a software design perspective one might argue that such an invasive change to model dynamics belongs in the source code itself, rather than a callback (and this of course how it works for PISCES, or any model other than Oceananigans --- since Oceananigans is the only model where we can envision such a fine-grained callback schema). I think having a callback infrastructure like this effectively allows people who implement advanced / custom applications to keep their code up to date with other changes to Oceananigans.

Usability,"> 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). I quite like the current convention for specifying fluxes since (imho) it's more mathematically intuitive, so my vote goes to maintaining that convention if we can (although I agree that it makes it harder to apply it generally for immersed solids...). One way to do it would be to leave most of the heavy work for the user, which would have to specify fluxes in each of the immersed solid's interfaces separately. The user's script would look like what I did here:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/faed0c4ac85409cb94811b0bdba2bbb7becf330a/sandbox/drag_test.jl#L25-L41.

In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs. Not sure I understand this point.

What you propose is what I should have written down before. That would be how to specify the stretched grid using an array. Otherwise, you could pass a function. Okay, thanks for the clarification!

If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model.

Usability,> > Does the total energy do the same thing or is it just the momentum?; > ; > I'll add that to `flow_over_hills.jl`!. Thanks. . Given the fact that the reference case flows over a flat bottom it doesn't suprise me that the mometum decreases monotonically. . The 2nd and 3rd case are flowing over topography and there should be a periodic effect of the topography on the momentum. No? Total momentum must vary because of the forcing and I don't know exactly what that should look like.

Usability,"> > I'm strongly opposed to having multiple small packages.; >; > Why is that, given the benefits?. Mainly I think we can get all the same benefits by maintaining a single unified and tidy repository with sub-modules. I don't see Oceananigans as a complex project yet, we're barely at 2,500 lines of code (minus turbulence closure operators which aren't integrated yet). I can see reasons for having a separate repository for examples and tutorials if there are enough of them, but I don't see e.g. the output writers as being logically separate from the main code. As a stand alone package, OceananigansOutput.jl doesn't do anything useful. Something like TurbulenceClosures.jl could though. Keeping things in tidy submodules within a single repository increases code visibility, which I think is important. When I see a package or framework spread across multiply small packages I find it hard to get an idea about what it can do. Another nice thing is we currently have ""unified versioning"" so when releases occur we know everything works together. We don't have to worry about running with Oceananigans v0.x with OceananigansPlotting v0.y and OceananigansOutput#master to fix some issue. From a development perspective, issues and pull requests are now spread across multiple repositories and we can end up with pull requests that depend on other pull requests in other repositories, e.g. when adding in halo regions the main code got refactored but so did the output writers and plotting code would change as well. We can also end up with multiple test suites that need to pass, plus possibly multiple CI pipelines to manage. So right now it's easy to make atomic changes that touch upon multiple pieces of code (and we'll probably be in this stage where we need to refactor frequently for a while). I also don't have to git clone a bunch of repositories just to work on a simple example.

Just to clarify, the quoted example suggests integrating `b` to find `psi`. If `u` is a function of `y` only I think we can integrate the relation `dy(psi) = u` to find `psi`. If the geostrophic streamfunction is a function of `x, y` then I think solving an elliptic problem is required, probably?. To summarize:. * To obtain `psi(x, y, z)` from `b(x, y, z)`, we integrate the relation `b = f * dz(psi)`. `IntegratedField` is useful.; * To obtain `psi(x, y, z)` from from `u(x, y, z)`, `v(x, y, z)` I _think_ (might be worth thinking about this more) we solve the horizontal elliptic problem `hlap(psi) = dx(v) - dy(u)` at every vertical level.; * To obtain a 2D `psi(y, z)` (for example), we might be able to integrate `dy(psi) = u`. These techniques could be important when initializing from data, perhaps. I'm not sure. For example, if a 3D distribution of `T, S` were obtained from data without knowledge of the velocity field, it might make sense to initialize the problem with a geostrophic velocity field. It'd be great to have utilities for all of these cases eventually. For idealized work I think its better to specify the streamfunction `psi`.

Yes, when we make the hydrostatic approximation, we assume that the aspect ratio is thin and H/L is small. The hydrostatic assumption specifically refers to the use of this scaling in the vertical momentum equation (reducing it to a diagnostic equation for hydrostatic pressure). This same scaling applied to the Coriolis force leads to the ""traditional"" approximation such that Coriolis terms involving the _vertical_ velocity are neglected from the horizontal momentum equations (likewise, the terms involving the horizontal momentum are neglected from the vertical momentum balance; neglecting these terms must be made consistently for the system to conserve kinetic energy). This thin-aspect-ratio approximation (probably best to avoid implicating ""tradition"" in model formulation...) also needs to be invoked to justify ""f-plane"" and ""beta-plane"" approximations to the Coriolis term when the numerical model is supposed to approximate oceanic motion away from the poles. (The so-called ""non-traditional"" terms --- the projection of the planetary vorticity into horizontal directions --- have been variously found to have a small effect on turbulent boundary layer motions. This is probably because the effect of Coriolis forces is most pronounced at the largest scales, and the effect of the horizontal Coriolis components on large scale vertical motions is suppressed by the presence of an impenetrable surface at the top and bottom.).

No, we definitely don't want that. That would make it impossible to use `Fields` without a model. We want simple / default boundary conditions to work without an entire model state. One has to understand the additional arguments to `fill_halo_regions!` as part of a system to support _additional_ features for fields, such as boundary conditions that depend on other parts of the model state. There's a circular depedancy issue: when field boundary conditions depend on other fields, the entire system of fields must be created simultaneously for the computation to work properly. We don't have a _general_ system for this. We just support it within the context of a model, like the hydrostatic or nonhydrostatic model.

One is to implement the boundary conditions with the halo regions. Note that this is currently the strategy we use for the horizontal boundary conditions.

Since we already fill halo regions, this method does not have any additional cost. This is also the method used in OceanTurb. Another benefit of this method is that the boundary conditions can actually be saved to disk along with the interior part of the solution, and the value of fields on the boundary can be calculated directly from the saved field.; > ; > _Originally posted by @glwagner in https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/pull/283#issuecomment-500821917_",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/100#issuecomment-500846445:349,clear,clear,349,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/100#issuecomment-500846445,1,['clear'],['clear']

Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either.

One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension.

Usability,"> @tomchor since you're the main person using the tilted gravity feature, I'm wondering if you can help provide some insight into this ""stratified fluid at rest"" test. The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason. I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that. So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though.

Flux boundary conditions are both conceptually and practically easier to implement when the boundary fluxes are zero or constant. They can be trickier when they depend on interior flow variables. In our case, for example, the boundary condition on the perturbation variable $b'$ (the buoyancy tracer in Oceananigans) is that the *total* diffusive flux should vanish, which means the *perturbation* diffusive flux needs to be minus the *background* diffusive flux. . ![image](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12971166/d5eae1d6-4aa8-438e-870b-0ff17352dcea). Imposing a flux boundary condition requires knowing the diffusivity $\kappa$ right at the boundary. It is obvious how to implement this if the diffusivity is a constant, because the background diffusive flux is also a known constant, but less obvious how to do it when using a subgrid turbulence closure that yields a diffusivity that varies in space and time. @tomchor pointed out to use that we can sidestep this complexity if we just divide both sides of the boundary condition by $\kappa$, because then the boundary condition simply becomes that the buoyancy gradient across the boundary should just be equal to minus the background buoyancy gradient—a known constant in our problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3646#issuecomment-2211446146:1212,simpl,simply,1212,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3646#issuecomment-2211446146,1,['simpl'],['simply']

I ended up following the MITgcm manual: https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithm/algorithm.html#equation-elliptic-pnh. Equation (2.52) gives the 3D elliptic equations, and if you expand the right hand side using (2.53-2.55) and (2.58-2.59), and set _η=0_ (we have no free surface) then we get ∇²ϕNH = ∇·u(n) + Δt*∇·Gu(n+½). What's worrying me right now is that this all seems to work great when _Δt = 1_ but otherwise it doesn't work. I tried dividing by _Δt_ just to make sure but it also didn't work (you get very high velocity divergences and it eventually blows up). > Ps Does it work for 32bit now?.

I think a higher order WENO scheme is more important than lower-order scheme. However, a low-order WENO method is proposed [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01164-6). I think the 3rd order scheme may be quite diffusive and runs the risk of limiting to 1st order (?!). #995 attempts to implement nth order WENO but I think failed to achieve good CPU performance / compilation on the GPU. But @simone-silvestri perhaps you're able to achieve this?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-969290093:436,simpl,simple,436,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-969290093,1,['simpl'],['simple']
