It would be great to have the ability to produce TRACE level log messages allowing the user to have control on whether these are output or not. .

Testability,"I'm new at this, so I may be missing something, but it looks to me like there is an issue with the conversion code in GenomicsConverter.makeSAMRecord() in com.google.cloud.genomics.gatk.common. I've been working on this bam file issue, correcting errors in the files used for tests. Many of the errors involve reads with FLAGs that indicate that they are in pairs, but the mate is not extant in the file, causing the error. A way to fix this without deleting the offending reads is to set the FLAG to zero and also modify the RNEXT, PNEXT, and TLEN fields, if necessary, so that the read becomes single (provided that the values of all of these fields are not important for the tests). However, when I do this, I find that tests that write and then read bam files fail, because when the just-written file is read back, SAM validation complains that the mate unmapped FLAG is set for an unpaired read. It turns out that the copy of the file written by the test substitutes the value '8' for '0' as the FLAG for the modified reads. The relevant code in GenomicsConvertermakeSamRecord() (line 170) is:. flags += ((read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The effect of this line is that all reads which have null mate positions, even those which the FLAG specifies as unpaired, get the mate unmapped FLAG set, causing the validation errors that i'm seeing. The reason the tests have not failed before is apparently that the existing test files do not contain any reads with FLAGs that specify them as unpaired. A simple fix for this would be to convert the line above to:. flags += ( paired && (read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The redundant parens in the original code suggest that something like this may have been intended,but the google genomics documentation at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html gives the following pseudocode:. flags += read.n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033:276,test,tests,276,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"I'm not completely opposed to that way of dealing with this, but I'm not yet convinced either. . I'm not sure I see how having an extra argument is somehow shorter than having one special value that is included in the description of the original argument.

As for the documentation auto-generator showing the two args together, that is dependent on setting up the arguments so that the code specifies they are related, and adding some logic to the auto-generation to pull related arguments together. (As a contributing developer to a documentation auto-generator --the GATKDocs-- I can tell you that is not necessarily trivial and adds even more moving parts.) This also generates additional complexity for third-party developers of wrappers (such as Galaxy). Finally, it can be a source of confusion for users who are trying to look up an argument called ""-dont-Trim-whatever"" since presumably it's only going to be listed under T (-Trim-whatever) and not under D in the alphabetical list.

Testability,I'm running in intermittent issues when running HaplotypeCallerSpark with GATK 4.0.3.0 and was hoping to generate ideas to debug further.

Testability,"I'm stepping into the 7 remaining test failures in the debugger, and I think they may just be fixed by overwriting the actual output of `GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest.testEntireVariant` onto the expected output for all the forced output test cases. However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call). Once you do that, could you check whether `removeNonRefAndUnusedAltAlleles` is still necessary?

Testability,"I'm using GATK4 as a framework to implement my own tools, and it will be nice to have a way of perform integration tests using `IntegrationTestSpec`. Nevertheless, it requires the extension of the `CommandLineProgramTest` to run the command, and thus it is extending `BaseTest`. The issues that this infrastructure generates when trying to use this test classes are the following:; - `BaseTest` loading of `GenomeLocParser` is annotated with `@BeforeClass`, which throws an error because the reference genome (hg19MiniReference) is not present in the repository.; - `CommandLineProgramTest` is using `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main` for running the commands, but for custom tools the instanceMain with a different list of packages. Although this could be solved by extending the class by another abstract class. I propose (and I can implemented if you agree) the following:; - `CommandLineProgramTest` not implementing `BaseTest`.; - `CommandLineProgramTest` as a real abstract class without implementations of `getTestDataDir()` or `runCommandLine()`; - Abstract `GATKCommandLineProgramTest` extending both `CommandLineProgramTest` and `BaseTest`, sited in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.test` and used in all integrations tests in this repository and the protected repository.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2033:115,test,tests,115,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2033,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

These are also `HG19` (really, B37) variants, because Oncotator can't do `HG38` and I needed ground truth. So I need the B37 reference to go in so that these regression tests can be run. It will also preemptively solve the issue of needing to add unit tests for variants outside of the ""supported testing regions"" in Funcotator (where ""supported testing regions"" are loci supported by references in the tests) . This would be for when we find a problem variant in user data and need to add a new unit test. Anecdotally, I have found cases like this in some of the germline data that I've been running.

Testability,"I've implemented the Gaussian-kernel binary-segmentation algorithm from this paper: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413230/document This method uses a low-rank approximation to the kernel to obtain an approximate segmentation in linear complexity in time and space. In practice, performance is actually quite impressive!. The implementation is relatively straightforward, clocking in at ~100 lines of python. Time complexity is O(log(maximum number of segments) * number of data points) and space complexity is O(number of data points * dimension of the kernel approximation), which makes use for WGS feasible. Segmentation of 10^6 simulated points with 100 segments takes about a minute and tends to recover segments accurately. Compare this with CBS, where segmentation of a WGS sample with ~700k points takes ~10 minutes---and note that these ~700k points are split up amongst ~20 chromosomes to start!. There are a small number of parameters that can affect the segmentation, but we can probably find good defaults in practice. What's also nice is that this method can find changepoints in moments of the distribution other than the mean, which means that it can straightforwardly be used for alternate-allele fraction segmentation. For example, all segments were recovered in the following simulated multimodal data, even though all of the segments have zero mean:. ![baf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29100464-ad687946-7c79-11e7-99e4-962ab93709b4.png). Replacing the SNP segmentation in ACNV (which performs expensive maximum-likelihood estimation of the allele-fraction model) with this method would give a significant speedup there. Joint segmentation is straightforward and is simply given by addition of the kernels. However, complete data is still required. Given such a fast heuristic, I'm more amenable to augmenting this method with additional heuristics to clean up or improve the segmentation if necessary. We can also use it to initialize our more sophisticated HMM m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-321121666:425,log,log,425,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-321121666,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I've tested this version in both GVCF and non-GVCF mode, and with and without -L intervals, and it seems to work reasonably. The output, as far as I can tell, is very close to the GATK3 output, but not an exact match. Looking in IGV I suspect that we might have a few boundary artifacts from the new traversal, but I'll have to do more work to confirm this. I've made an effort in the past few days to get the annotations, filtering, etc., closer to GATK3, and this has helped a lot. I have not tested all of the more exotic HC arguments, however, and it's very likely that a few are not completely functional. . Hooking up the native `PairHmm` resulted in a ~3x speedup and hopefully made us more competitive with GATK3 in performance -- I'll post some benchmarking numbers here later. The `isActive()` machinery was ported, but is not currently used (ie., we consider all sites as active for now). At one point I attempted a standalone tool to do the `isActive()` step, but the overhead of going through the reads twice and writing down a huge sites-level file with the results from the individual loci caused me to abandon that idea. Still, we may want to experiment more with a streamlined version of isActive() in the future if we can't get the performance we want from the current implementation. `ReadWindowWalker` has an entry point to plug in a future `isActive()` check if we choose to add one.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1567#issuecomment-194847622:5,test,tested,5,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1567#issuecomment-194847622,3,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmarking', 'tested']"
Testability,"I've tried to study the code that turns a split read into a stranded interval pair so that it can be compared directly to the disparate read pair info, and I can't convince myself that it's correct. There seem to be a bunch of cases that aren't covered. For example, it seems to me that the first step would have to be reversing the cigars on negative strand SA's, so that you can see which pairs of SA's are genuinely supplemental to -- and potentially partially overlapping -- each other, and the actual order of the aligned sequences. (I'm sure this is unclear, too. We can talk.). Is there a unit test that mocks the reads we'd expect to get from an inversion breakpoint, both discordant and split.

Testability,"IMO. In fact ideally I'd like to write a design doc or something similar, and only code after the design is agreed on. --------. > I would of course prefer not to have to have a hard filter on length. This would mean we would never call a large inversion even if it exists. . Answer: Totally agree. Now looking back, it get clearer to me that this proposal contains two parts: the filtering part, and the breakpoint linking part, separated into two major classes `InversionBreakendPreFilter` and `LinkedInversionBreakpointsInference`. That being said, it doesn't make much sense to separate them into two PRs because _currently_ the filtering part is designed around the linking part, i.e. it is trying to check which BND's are suitable to the logic implemented in the linking part, and if the logic isn't applicable to an BND, the BND simply slips through without generating any new interpretations. So `InversionBreakendPreFilter` is a filter and a classifier at the same time, it function is really diverting different BND's to be handled by different logics, and it definitely should be improved.; If you buy this argument, I am also fully aware of the code design issue that it is preferable to NOT divert&mdash;gather&mdash;send through different handlers like it currently is for calling variants from the assembly contigs, instead it should be a single stream pass through all the BND's. I'll try to follow the preferred design. > What about some other filters more specifically aimed at the artifacts that cause these false large calls? I think it's a good idea to check annotations -- ie. do the mates lie at two regions that are segmental duplications of each other, or one side of the mate looks like a transposable element insertion? I guess it's ok to put in a tool with this limit temporarily, though. Answer: Agree. And I think these kind of checking are not only good, but a mandate for a good caller, i.e. to take advantage of prior knowledge. I am also thinking about improving it ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929:1434,log,logics,1434,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929,1,['log'],['logics']

Testability,"If you train a VQSR model on a subset of the variants under consideration and serialize it, then provide it via `--input-model` to subsequent VQSR runs on sets of variants including those other than in the original training subset (the only use case for which you'd bother serializing a model in the first place, probably), this will result in variants in those subsequent sets being incorrectly labeled as `NEGATIVE_TRAINING_SITE`. The culprit lines of code are: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/5b8736715724d6ba7994613acbc37e1bf187f538/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/vqsr/VariantRecalibrator.java#L644-L650. Instead, only those negative training sites taken from the original subset and used to generate the serialized negative model should be labeled as such. Note also that we needlessly select the worst scoring variants here, which leads to the bad behavior as well as a misleading log message. There is also some residual funkiness from the fact that we require the specification of the number of training variants in order to construct a GMM from a serialized model, which is a result of further funkiness from the fact that we require the size of the array of responsibilities to be initialized using this number. Unfortunately, I don't think there's an easy fix, since we don't actually pass either the correct positive/negative training labels (in the recal table generated by the original run) or the necessary information to reconstruct them otherwise (e.g., we could repeat the VQSLOD calculations, given the original training subset sites and VQSLOD cutoffs used to originally derive the negative labels) to these subsequent runs. (Unless we actually want to pass those things, which seems messy.).

Testability,"Implements two new tools and updates some methods for a revamp of the `CombineBatches` cross-batch integration module in [gatk-sv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv). - `SVStratify` - tool for splitting out a VCF by variant class. Users pass in a configuration table (see tool documentation for an example) specifying one or more stratification groups classified by SVTYPE, SVLEN range, and reference context(s). The latter are specified as a set of interval lists using `--context-name` and `--context-intervals` arguments. All variants are matched with their respective group which is annotated in the `STRAT` INFO field. Optionally, the output can be split into multiple VCFs by group, which is a very useful functionality that currently can't be done efficiently with common commands/toolkits.; - `GroupedSVCluster` - a hybrid tool combining functionality from `SVStratify` with `SVCluster` to perform intra-stratum clustering. This tool is critical for fine-tuned clustering of specific variants types within certain reference contexts. For example, small variants in simple repeats tend to have lower breakpoint accuracy and are typically ""reclustered"" during call set refinement with looser clustering criteria.; - `SVStratificationEngine` - new class for performing stratification.; - Updates to breakpoint refinement in `CanonicalSVCollapser` that should improve breakpoint accuracy, particularly in larger call sets. Raw evidence support and variant quality are now considered when choosing a representative breakpoint for a group of clustered SVs.; - Added `FlagFieldLogic` type for customizing how `BOTHSIDE_PASS` and `HIGH_SR_BACKGROUND` INFO flags are collapsed during clustering.; - `RD_CN` is now used as a backup if `CN` is not available when determining carrier status for sample overlap.; - Removed no-sort option in favor of spooled sorting.; - Bug fix: support for empty EVIDENCE info fields; - Bug fix: in one of the JointGermlineCnvDefragmenter tests",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8990:1976,test,tests,1976,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8990,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"In helping @bhanugandham figure out why a particular site was failing it became apparent that merging dangling head code was failing to recover deletions in the dangling head. Furthermore there is some code in the dangling end recovery code that asserts a certain high standard of matching (usually 1 but sometimes dangling branch length/kmersize) `getMaxMismatches(final int lengthOfDanglingBranch)`. Both of these facts seem likely to cause dangling heads to be dropped despite their being still potentially informative, particularly the indel code. . I have added the ability for the index recovery code to account for the cigar string when merging dangling ends. Addtionally rather than counting mismatches to reject the branch it simply requires a minimum matching end (which can be changed, I suspect this is where the lionshare of the differences come from).

Testability,"In light of the discovery of the (relatively minor) numerical differences caused by changes to non-CNV code outlined in #7649, and because we are still awaiting coverage from pipeline-level/CARROT testing, I decided to go ahead and add these exact-match tests. This essentially freezes current ModelSegments behavior, which has been exactly stable since https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5814; that is, from sometime between 4.1.0.0/4.1.1.0 almost 3 years ago up to 4.2.4.1 today. Note that the original test files were generated from the test BAMs (e.g., src/test/resources/large/cnv_somatic_workflows_test_files/HCC1143-t1-chr20-downsampled.deduplicated.bam), since these BAMs have been used in the past to consistently generate test files for other tools in the ModelSegments and GermlineCNVCaller pipelines. However, these original test files contained insufficient data to activate the changes found in #7649, even had exact-match tests been present. I thus took some old HCC1143T 100% WES data that I had and snippeted it to chr20. I've confirmed that the added tests with these files would've picked up the regression of log10factorial seen in #7649 for all relevant modes (i.e., all those that take in the allele counts as input, since that regression only affected allele-fraction MCMC sampling). Tests take maybe an additional minute to run and there was about ~12MB of additional large resources checked in, but I didn't try too hard to bring either down. I also added some early-fail parameter validation to check that the minimum total allele count in the case sample is zero in matched-normal mode. There are actually some open questions in my mind as to what the best behavior should be here, but given some of the discussion in #6499 and possible plans for using joint segmentation to do filtering of germline events, I think it's best to enforce that all het sites coming out of the genotyping step are the same across all samples.

Testability,In light of the recent #7357 and #7358 it has become clear that we are blind changes that cause the logging outputs for GATK to become unusable because we are spitting endless warnings to stdout. I think we should change our integration tests to capture the log output for each of our tests and assert that none of them balloon beyond some reasonable threshold that would capture these problems (perhaps a megabyte but it would take a little bit of sleuthing to be sure). . I would think the best place would be to add a capture into `CommandLineProgramTest.runCommandLine()` that instead of using the current behavior `injectDefaultVerbosity()` we instead leave the logging output as the default and capture it somewhere explicit where we can make assertions about the size of the outputs. Possibly we could create a dummy logging level that just saves and counts the outputs so we can make assertions about the logs. Ideally this should apply to every tool simultaneously since it would be too patchwork to simply add logging output tests for enough of the tools to protect us manually.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368:100,log,logging,100,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368,12,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'assertions', 'log', 'logging', 'logs', 'tests']"

Specifically the faster older version was broadinstitute/gatk-nightly:2022-03-04-4.2.5.0-9-gb097f75c5-NIGHTLY-SNAPSHOT which was before the Java 17 migration (which is a high likelihood culprit form the past year). .

Testability,"Investigating. It looks like the problem has something to do with the hadoop jars using protobuf-java [version 2.x](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.7.2), but gcloud-java using [version 3.x](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.cloud/gcloud-java-core/0.2.5). When we include both dependencies, gradles bumps everything to protobuf 3.x and this seems to break the Hadoop libraries. I can reproduce the problem on master without even adding a gcs dependency, just by adding a protobuf 3.x dependency. ```; $ git diff build.gradle; + compile 'com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.0.0-beta-2'; $ ./gradlew clean test --tests '*ReadsSparkSourceUnitTest.testReadFromFileAndHDFS'; Gradle suite > Gradle test > org.broadinstitute.hellbender.engine.spark.datasources.ReadsSparkSourceUnitTest.testReadFromFileAndHDFS FAILED; org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError): Could not initialize class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos; ```. The problem does not reproduce (at least not for this particular test) if I use an earlier version of the protobuf jar (3.0.0-beta-1). I just tried the whole test suite and it passed. So one hypothesis is that we may be able to move forward if I can somehow force gcloud-java-core:0.2.5 to use protobufs beta-1 instead of beta-3, and if this change doesn't break the gcloud code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1994#issuecomment-232788200:650,test,test,650,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1994#issuecomment-232788200,7,['test'],"['test', 'testReadFromFileAndHDFS', 'tests']"

The problem is that we either add these numbers to the p-value or not by checking if they are less than or equal to some threshold. In this case these rounding errors can have a large impact (especially when the number of reads is relatively small) on the final p-value.

However, we can't just use the log4j one since its not an enum (the values are represented by a bunch of static objects) and it doesn't have a constructor that conforms to the command line arg processors requirements. So the choices would be to retain the dependency on the picard enum, or write our own enum for HB and then write the mapping code you suggest between that and log4j (which I'd vote for). In the meantime I've moved and updated the tests as you suggested.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/603#issuecomment-123302941:160,Log,Log,160,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/603#issuecomment-123302941,3,"['Log', 'log', 'test']","['Log', 'logger', 'tests']"
Testability,"Its possible to specify CNN inference size argument values that cause the Python process run out of memory, and the failure mode appears to be the java process hangs. Its not clear whether its always possible to recover from this using the global exception handler we currently install on the Python side - we need to explore a bit to see if the handler is being invoked on OOM; whether catching the OOM exception explicitly would help, or if we need an alternative reporting strategy for low-memory conditions. Attached is a log provided by @bhanugandham from a run in a Terra notebook that failed and that exhibited a hang that we assume was due to OOM, and that was resolved by reducing the inference batch size.

I'll expand on these and add tests for denoising in the future, but for now we have a working revised pipeline up through segmentation.

The number of segments can similarly be controlled in WGS. WGS runtime is ~7min for 250bp bins, ~30s of which is TSV reading, and there is one more spot in my implementation that could stand a bit of optimization, which might bring the runtime down.

(edited) ; 1:55; what is the scale factor of 1/2 for?; 1:58; one other thing — how come σ_(min/maj) is the sum of the total CR segment’s variance (i.e. σ_τ) and the allelic segment’s variance?; 2:00; this would imply that the allelic segments are actually a sum of the random variables corresponding to the allelic and total segmentation, which I’m not sure is the case?. slee 5:32 PM; Sorry, just now seeing your questions!; 5:33; The scale factor of 1/2 is pretty arbitrary. Just trying to give an estimate of posterior width when the credible interval might be skewed. A better approach would be to refit posteriors with Gaussians/Betas as mentioned previously.; 5:35; However, I'm not actually convinced that these credible intervals are what we want to pass to the sigmas. As I also mentioned above, if sigma.tau is supposed to be a global quantity, probably the posterior median of the parameter that controls the global variance (given in the .cr.params file) might be a better thing to use. However, I never got a straight answer from anybody about whether this was a segment-level or global quantity---any idea?. slee 5:41 PM; As for using the sum of the CR variance and the MAF variance, you're right---we should be propagating error for the product of the two random variables.

GenomeLocParser is essentially a deprecated holdover from gatk3 that we haven't made the effort to completely remove yet. . Would it be useful if we packaged these small test files in the jar and had them automatically extracted when tests run? That would provide a basic set of example files that someone developing new tools could play with. . I think we mostly use BaseTest as a convenient way to find common files and a place to put common test functions like the `getTemp` family. Those are mostly statics that could be called from anywhere though. The only other stuff it really does is set up the the test spark context and set test logging verbosity. Moving the common files out of BaseTest might be a hard sell for people here, but we could extract a superclass that does the important set up and has the various functions without having the project specific files.

Testability,"K version in the ExcessHet documentation to 4.2.2.0, but we'll see if I need to revisit that.; - [x] Not quite sure about the `ReducibleAnnotation` business. Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr. Here are some plots for N = 50, 100, and 500 samples showing (in black) those counts that previously fell under the 3E-6 threshold with the mid-p correction but now pass without it. As you can see, not much to sweat from these ""theoretical"" plots, but good to convolve with the actual allele frequency spectrum and get an idea of how many sites occupy these black squares in practice (as well as start us down the road of reexamining the threshold itself):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413689-37f3dfeb-e3f5-4869-a803-fe27f3cd79bd.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413649-d716ee7d-6763-4275-82de-e0e226dcb1de.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413673-11f54f3f-975c-46ab-b874-ec37e461694f.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7394#issuecomment-914612907:1314,test,test,1314,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7394#issuecomment-914612907,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Let me know if and how we can help in this @cmnbroad. Just to keep you updated, Sheila and I are spending the next three weeks updating GATK4 documentation. We aim for all documentation to be complete by December 14. It's possible we will organize the forum tool documentation to mirror that of this categorization. There was talk today in a meeting with the engine team that we should propose multiple categorizations, for the (much later, not upcoming release) possibility for listing tools based on user preference, e.g. by functional category or by input file type. So any work you do towards categorization could be useful down the road. . Here are some questions that were raised during the meeting:; - GATK vs Picard should be separate. One reason is because the standard arguments are different.; - The categories within each program would mirror.; - Consistent categorization. Last I checked, CNV tools were listed in its own category while other tools appear organized by input file type. Because we need to also ensure every tool (excepting Spark and BWA) has a summary description and example command, it would be useful for documentation purposes at least, to have functional categories that take the same or related inputs, e.g. any type of interval list (BED, Picard style or GATK), so that we can group testing of the tool commands and there is minimal context switching.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706:1319,test,testing,1319,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706,1,['test'],['testing']

For the mock up, I recommend we have two configuration files, one containing system properties and the other containing a few general engine settings. . We can select a few system properties from `gatk-launch` for inclusion in the system properties config file (eg., `samjdk.compression_level`, `samjdk.use_async_io_read_samtools`, etc.). . For the engine settings file, I recommend including `codecPackages` (a `List<String>` currently hardcoded in `FeatureManager.CODEC_PACKAGES`), `cloudPrefetchBuffer`/`cloudIndexPrefetchBuffer` (int values) from `GATKTool`, and `createOutputBamIndex` (boolean), also from `GATKTool`.

Testability,"Let's discuss more in person. It may be that the rounding is indeed a bug, but we'd want a regression test before we merge. For now, building a PoN using PCOV with noQC should be fine. (Note that QC is not the same as the filtering of targets/samples with too many zeros, etc., it specifically refers to the removal of samples with large events from the original PoN. But perhaps the ad hoc way this is done, along with the possible bug, is causing problems with the filtering step when creating the final PoN.) . Also, noQC is used in the WDL for a different reason---so that the small test BAMs can be used to build a PoN successfully. CreatePanelOfNormals belongs in the somatic workflow for now. You can think of it as a tool that produces a resource for denoising somatic samples. Eventually it will be replaced by gCNV, at which point we can discuss how the WDL should be organized.

Testability,"Let's hear what others say, but I think I would strongly prefer to simply take over VariantEval in another repo if this was something you'd consider. I'd likely do much of what you propose anyway (certainly WRT testing); however, perhaps not the microscope we went through with the core GATK changes earlier. On plugins: I like what seems to be shaping up w/ Barclay. I carried over the Stratifier and Evaluator as plugins because it seems like it would make sense to allow tools to provide extensions (VariantEval, our tool, does). If I took this PR a step further, I would have migrated many arguments currently top-level on VariantEval into the plugins themselves (a good feature in Barclay). As an aside: I dont think VariantAnnotator is migrated yet, but we have many GATK3 plugins related to annotation, and hope that tool retains Annotator plugins when it get migrated. My impressions of barclay are probably a little out of date. I agree the main argument parsing framework is pretty robust. Specifically on plugins, it seems a little less so, or at least there are not many tools I visibly see exercising that part of the code. For example, there really should be a default implmentation or base class between Barclay's plugins and ReadFilter plugins. I'm guessing if more tools in GATK4 were using plugins this would have happened. I created something like this for VariantEval, and without a ton of work that could probably get generalized; however, doing so would throw a lot higher bar on me and as noted above I'm trying to take on less, not more at the moment.

Testability,"Like I said, I don't know enough to say if this approach is feasible, but sometimes it's possible to test an algorithm with a problem-generating function. This works well when it's easy to generate self-consistent solutions and test data consistent with a given solution. I was able to do this for some of the interval overlap functions on the python side of my code. Other methods were too complicated (for me to figure out anyway). Let's say you have an algorithm function f_algo that you want to test. You design a function test_data_factory that takes as input either a known solution, or a set of parameters from which it can easily generate a known solution (by a route that is logically distinct from the way f_algo works). Then f_tester generates and returns test_data. The flow looks like; ```; // get either random test solutions or some distinct set that tests particular edge cases; test_params = get_test_params();; test_solution = easy_solution_from_params(test_params);. test_data = test_data_factory(test_params, test_solution);; assert f_algo(test_data) == test_solution;; ```; In some sense you've already done that, but you've personally stepped in as test_data_factory(), and I'm wondering if it would be possible to automate that to get rid of all those numbers in the test code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429:101,test,test,101,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429,8,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'logically', 'test', 'tests']"

We only see the PL=0,0,0 after position 14155446 in this GVCF. The GQ is determined by the GL calculation, the logic of which lives in `ReferenceConfidenceModel.doIndelRefConfCalc()`. Looking at that code it looks like it calculates the SNP GL and the Indel GL and chooses the most pessimistic outlook. Unfortunately every read at this site ends at 14155455, thus when we call out to `calcNReadsWithNoPlausibleIndelsReads()` we hit a snag since all of the reads in the sample have 9 bases left. If we check the documentation for that method we see the following line:; `Positions <= maxIndelSize from the end of the provided read/ref always return false`. This means that every read returns a value of false for indel informativeness since the result is too close to the end, thus we call into `getIndelPLs()` with a count of 0 informative reads, thus giving us the PL 0,0,0. .

Testability,"Looks great!. One quick note: I don't get the idea behind `Poisson` -- shouldn't we simply use negative binomials w/ modeled `mu_sj` and `alpha_sj`, evaluated at observed counts (`tt.arange(min_count, max_count + 1)`), and weighted with the number bins for each count (`_hist_sjm`)? i.e. if one observes an empirical distribution `P_obs(x)` rather than `x` draws, then the appropriate max likelihood objective function is `\sum_x P_obs(x) log P_model(x | \theta)`. Perhaps this is exactly what you've done and I don't get it. Another quick note: what I had in mind was _either_ modeling `mu_sj` at quantized ploidy states, _or_ let the ploidy state be unrestricted w/ a penalty via. a Bernoulli process (possibly w/ different per-contig penalties to account for e.g. higher rate of X/Y loss). We have enough samples in the cohort to select the quantized model (and those samples pin down the per-contig biases `b_j`). The samples that do not conform to quantized ploidy states can then choose whatever (variable) ploidy state they wish by paying a (hefty) price. We would also need to mask contigs that have variable ploidy calls from gCNV.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376286536:439,log,log,439,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376286536,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Many of the pull requests are not using [`CommandLineProgramTest.runCommandLine()`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/blob/c6b41e6da8c9ea3f03206a25ce4ad74312b154f0/src/test/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/CommandLineProgramTest.java). I'm assuming this is because we have not settled on a way to `Assert` that outputs are similar after running a hellbender command line. This issue should resolve with a definition how far one should test before a pull request is accepted. After an arbitrary low level patch to the codebase, I believe the GATK [`MD5DB`](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/3b67b448072e24c80779b2e1cbc9dcfcb5dce4cf/public/gatk-tools-public/src/test/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/utils/MD5DB.java) and [`DiffEngine`](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/3b67b448072e24c80779b2e1cbc9dcfcb5dce4cf/public/gatk-tools-public/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/engine/walkers/diffengine/DiffEngine.java) are considered too hard to verify-and-update en masse. This limitation would also apply to external framework test utilities, such as TestNG's `FileAssert.assertLength()`. A 2009 discussion of file comparators is archived [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/466841/comparing-text-files-w-junit). Ultimately, I believe the biggest pain point with the `MD5DB` is that there does not exist a quick way to a) diagnose what has changed and b) to then update all hundreds of expected outputs. As in `DiffEngine`, we could define a way to regression test that only certain aspects of common file types aren't changing (exact number of reads in BAMs, or exact number of variants in BCF), or that values are falling within a certain range (number of quality scores all above 30 under 60), etc. As for updating results, instead of embedding the expected `MD5DB` outputs in a hundreds of java test files, one could also externalize _all_ of the expected outputs to another file (json, flat text, etc.) such that this singular sorted file for the entire test suite may be updated ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/69:179,test,test,179,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/69,4,"['Assert', 'test']","['Assert', 'test']"

Testability,"Might be a dupe of https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4375 (note the date...). Continuing our discussion on Slack, we could add some tests on the simulated data that are suitably insensitive to numerical instability, but still check for whatever events may happen to be in the simulated data. I'm not sure if there's a record of the latter, as I would guess the data was generated with an external python script, but I suppose you could always just take what is currently output by the test as the expected result. There is some cost associated with adding, running, and maintaining such tests, and I'll leave it up to you and @mwalker174 to decide whether it's worth it.

It performs relatively well on some samples (and was used to generate results for the AACR poster), but others result in oversegmentation and convergence issues.

The tool runs successfully in both 1D and 2D modes, and a strict integration test passes for the 1D model.

Testability,"Mutect2 matches called variants against known variants retrieved from the germline resource VCF (if available) for the POPAF annotation. While comparing the called allele to the germline resource variants, Mutect2 only takes into account the sequence of the alternate allele(s) while ignoring the reference allele sequence. This can cause incorrect annotations at sites with multiple alternate alleles (e.g. CT -> C/CTT in the germline resource while M2 calls C -> CT).

Testability,"My GenotypeGVCFs run for a single chromosome returned the following completion statement:; 18:54:40.516 INFO ProgressMeter - Traversal complete. Processed 606308 total variants in 75.2 minutes. However, there are only 46814 variant rows (excluding 52 header rows) in the corresponding vcf file. Does the above figure of 606308 correspond to a multiple of 'variants x number of samples'?. Also, there are only 16863 lines in my log file, does this mean that the 'Current Locus' column in the log file doesn't correspond to a single genomic location (bp) in the fasta file?. I am curious to know what is the relation between all these figures to fully understand what is happening while processing the gCVF files. Also, on the inbreeding coefficient warning issue, I understand from your @Neato-Nick feedback that the variants with these warnings may still be fine and can be retained. However, this still leaves me worrying that out of 384 samples the locus doesn't even have 10 samples for generating the required metrics. Such variants won't be of any use for downstream analyses anyway where any variants with more than 80% missing samples will be removed. Therefore, I wish to seek some more information about this 10 sample thing - does it have some other context or does it literally mean that there are only less than 10 samples carrying that variant?.

Testability,"My first idea was to port it to ReadTools (that's why I asked to change it to the public code when GATK3 was divided into the non-free version and the plan was not to port indel-realignment). Nevertheless, someone showed interest into this and that's why I did this PRs; in addition, it is much better than the original authors (if still at Broad) can contribute to see if the port is correct. Anyway, I don't have any strong feeling about this, and I can always port the pipeline to ReadTools and maintain it there (actually, I had some ideas for other realignment methods and it will be interesting to compare with this). @cmnbroad - this was a long time ago, when even some of the standards (documentation and kebab-case arguments) were not even implemented. Regarding the tests, the last commit includes one using a BAM file in the repository, and the output was generated with GATK3 (if I remember correctly, although I can't remember the version). I think that the best way to go is to re-open a PR to have a cleaner history and proper standards. The idea will be:. 1. Copy of the GATK3 files (from the latest release); 2. Reformat (license and coding-style); 3. Port to the new framework.; 4. Convert documentation and arguments to the GATK4 format; 5. Add tests by running the latest GATK3 release on data in the repository and checking concordance. If a different dataset should be used for the tests, it will be nice if you can provide some. Otherwise, I will use data in the repository (b37_reference_20_21 and NA12878_20_21_WGS_bam)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763:776,test,tests,776,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763,3,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"My first question is does this reproduce with a different PairHMM implementation? It might be a precision problem, in which case the prior should do a good job. But we've also seen cases of the PairHMM giving significantly higher likelihoods for one alt over the reference (a difference of about 0.07 for the bottom gray read in the example below):; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6578548/40784632-34eb920e-64b4-11e8-9575-c26180808172.png); When @vruano dug into that one, the likelihoods were correct as evaluated by the PairHMM because we compare the likelihood sums over all alignments supporting each allele rather than the maximum likelihoods.

Testability,"My recollection is that this is a use case we never put any priority on so there's no test in the GATK suite for access to private files. There should be, of course. The feature is there and (at least locally) it worked when I tried it. NIO does not use the API_KEY, it uses default credentials. Those are environment variables that are set by the `gcloud` command or pre-set for you in the case of virtual machines on Google. There are two cases: local execution and Spark. . I just tested local execution and it worked fine for me:. ```; $ ./gatk-launch PrintReads -L Broad.human.exome.b37.small.interval_list -I gs://jpmartin-private/bench/WGS-G94982-NA12878.bam -O t_gcs.bam; ```. this command worked even though (unless I'm mistaken) neither the bucket nor the file are public. One challenge however is that the way to set default credentials has changed recently. Calling `gcloud auth login` used to be enough but now we have to call (IIRC) `gcloud auth application-default login`. For Spark, the default credentials are set as whoever owns the dataproc environment that's used to run the show. So it should be set so it has access to the buckets necessary. NIO has mechanisms for accessing buckets that belong to someone other than who is running the Spark job, but they are not hooked into GATK yet.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2394#issuecomment-277832658:86,test,test,86,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2394#issuecomment-277832658,4,"['log', 'test']","['login', 'test', 'tested']"

Testability,"Need some guidance here. The CompareSAMs tool was not propagating the validation stringency. I have a fix for that, but that alone doesn't fix the compareBAMFiles test in BaseRecalibrationIntegrationTest.java, since that uses SamAssertionUtils.assertSamsEqual, which also doesn't propagate (or accept) a validation stringency. Changing SamAssertionUtils to use either SILENT or LENIENT does fix the integration test, and all the other tests pass, but it seems like a relaxing of the stringency, and I'm not sure it should be necessary to the BQSR test.

Testability,"No problem – I can see how this would be challenging to review – maybe it’s not even practical – if you decide it’s best just not to use it that’s OK - working on these issues has been a valuable learning experience for me. . I sent an archive with the new validations and the diffs between the old and new bams to akiezun. Although in many cases the files shared types of errors, I had to look at each file individually to take into account the particular errors in each file and how to fix them without (to the best of my knowledge) interfering with the purpose of the test. I did write a python script to use where necessary for converting multiple unpaired reads in a file to single reads, and I used bash scripts to call the picard tools to convert multiple files at a time from bam to sam for editing and then back again after they were modified. In some cases I had to modify the values in test output files to match the values produced by the test using the modified bams/sams, or just capture the new output files and use them to replace the old with the new. In two cases where file format errors appeared to be necessary but the filename did not indicate this, I renamed the files to make this clear.

Testability,"Not really an issue, just wanted to document some surprising behavior. @tmelman has been reviving/reimplementing some ancient CNV/ModelSegments evaluations (dating as far back as 4.0.2.1!) and trying to understand whether observed differences---intentional or otherwise---are due to method changes I might have made, or if she might've introduced changes in her reimplementation of the evaluation code. I ran some checks on the stability of ModelSegments using an old set of inputs (normal/tumor allelic counts and denoised copy ratios for SM-74P4M WES). Behavior has remained largely stable since at least 4.1.0.0. Namely:. 1) We evaluated and signed off on a change that went into 4.1.0.0. See comments in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5575.; 2) A slight numerical difference in the MCMC-sampled allele fractions was introduced by changes made to some MathUtils code for calculating logs/factorials/etc. between 4.1.0.0 and 4.1.1.0 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5814. Note that no CNV code was directly changed, it's just that we call out to that changed MathUtils code---namely, to calculate log10factorial. The overall result in my test was a very slight change to the number of segments found, from 516 to 522.; 3) No further numerical changes have been introduced through the current 4.2.4.1, so any additional code changes I made were indeed true refactors, at least from the perspective of this simple test. Phew!. I was indeed surprised to find that very slight differences in the log10factorial behavior (which result from changing the recursive calculation of cached values to a direct one, and appear in something like the 13th decimal place) led to non-negligible changes in the MCMC estimates of the allele fractions---and thus, changes in the number of segments.

Testability,"Now that I've spent a day surveying the landscape of p-values, I'm thinking what must've happened is that an undocumented mid-p-value correction was added to the one-tailed p-value we claim to calculate. This is probably a fine thing to calculate, but such a correction is not discussed in the annotation docs nor in the Wigginton paper cited there. Nor is this what is calculated by any of the other implementations out there, as far as I can tell. So we could keep the original calculation, while further clarifying what exactly we are calculating in the docs (and add references, if appropriate). In this case, we can just keep the cleanup and improved tests as a bonus. (As a further bonus, we won't lose our old friend 3.0103!). Or we could move to this calculation. In this case, I believe we would match the bcftools ExcHet p-value (although I still need to check this claim for correctness). I'm not sure if the original intent was to be more/less conservative in retaining sites during hard filtering prior to VQSR. But since the filtering threshold used in Best Practices seems very conservative, I would guess that we wanted to err on the side of not throwing out possible variants, even if they are pretty out of HWE. Which makes the choice of a mid p-value puzzling, since it's strictly smaller and will thus lead to more rejections (I think, if I've got everything the right way around!). Happy to go either direction.

Testability,"OK @droazen @davidbenjamin I think this is ready for review. Note that:. 1) I did not restore the optimization introduced by @davidbenjamin in #5466. Happy to file an issue to restore it later by adding the appropriate parameter check, if we think it's important.; 2) I only added integration tests for HC and M2, since there is only a minimal test for FilterAlignmentArtifacts at this time. But I would think that these tests are enough to show that the exposure preserves behavior (unless I somehow got extremely unlucky with the test data and parameter values...); 3) Apologies to the reviewer for the somewhat complicated commit history, which resulted from introducing/removing the TSV stuff and was more trouble than it might be worth to reorder/resolve in the final rebase.

Testability,"OK I did some more testing, turns out I was wrong (the forum post was also misleading). ; The problems in the comparison here are not between the Input VCF and the dbSNP, but between the dbSNP and the Reference FASTA file. . I.e. I was using the dbSNP file where the order of chromosomes was like this; `1,2,3...` (downloaded from BROAD); But the Reference FASTA had the order of chromosomes like this; `1,10,11...` (downloaded from ENSEMBL).

Testability,OK so [the script I wrote earlier](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/2bbc917d86942bdc0a72670cb3925ccd4d56e661/scripts/variantstore/repo/generate_git_filter_repo_command.sh) was really about figuring out which files in `ah_var_store` were candidates to be moved to a new `variantstore` repo and not explicitly about identifying cruft in our `ah_var_store` branch (though I did incidentally identify some cruft in the process of writing the script). However a couple of functions from this can be repurposed to find cruft:. ```; % comm -1 -2 <(files_deleted_from_master) <(files_added_on_ah_var_store) ; scripts/vcf_site_level_filtering_cromwell_tests/vcf_site_level_filtering_travis.json; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.22.avg.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.22.avg.vcf.gz.tbi; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.23.avg.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.23.avg.vcf.gz.tbi; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.sites_only.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.sites_only.vcf.gz.tbi; %; ```.

Testability,"OK, @meganshand pointed me to the original Wigginton R implementation at http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Exact/snp_hwe.r and the Hail implementation at https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/stats/LeveneHaldane.scala, further mentioning that these may have been used for checking test values. Both of these use the recurrence relation, rather than directly computing the likelihoods as the python implementation above does. Note that the documentation in ExcessHet indicates that a one-sided p-value is intended to be calculated according to Wigginton. However, the Wigginton R implementation calculates a two-sided p-value, although expressions for one-sided p-values are commented out. The latter also seem to contain typos, perhaps due to R indexing:; ```; phi <- min(1.0, sum(probs[obs_hets + 1: rare + 1]) / mysum); ```; should be; ```; phi <- min(1.0, sum(probs[(obs_hets + 1):(rare + 1)]) / mysum); ```; See implementations in other languages at http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Exact/, one of which I would presume was used to calculate the expressions in Table 1 of the paper. Finally, the Hail implementation instead calculates a two-sided mid p-value (see e.g. https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/teaching/SISG14/Graffelman_Moreno_SAGMB_2013.pdf), which oftentimes turns out to be the complement of the quantity that is *actually* calculated by ExcessHet.

Testability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately.

Testability,"OK, here is how to see the problem. BaseRecalibratorSpark has the workaround in place (write report, read it back in).

Testability,"OK, relaxed the exact match to a delta of 1E-6 (chosen because doubles are formatted in somatic CNV outputs as `""%.6f""`) and tests pass on Travis (modulo an unrelated intermittent timeout failure). Note also that I was also able to reproduce locally by switching between Java 8 and 11. Had to add some quick test code for doing the comparisons; not actually sure if we have other utility methods to do so somewhere in the codebase. Another interesting note: I tried to clean up the offending use of log10factorial in AlleleFractionLikelihoods, but this introduced numerical differences at the ~1E-3 level. I think all of the round tripping between log and log10 actually adds up. Some digging revealed that this was introduced way back in gatk-protected in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/commit/aeec297e104db9f5196cb8f8e6691133302474bc#diff-34bd76cb2a416a212e25cbfb11298207265fb9cced775918aefcdb6b91ebc247. Despite the fact that we could easily replace the use of log10factorial with a private logGamma cache, at this point I think it makes more sense to freeze the current behavior.

Testability,"OK, tests are finally passing. I think we are close to where a review is useful; however, i have three known questions:. 1) Do you have advise on dealing with raw -> generic lists/maps in StratificationManager and VariantEvalReportWriter? You'll see I put a placeholder cast() method in each that copies the collection as a placeholder. I didnt see a more elegant option. 2) From way back in this thread, there was discussion of making a proper DefaultPluginDescriptor. Currently I have a functional DefaultPluginDescriptor in the varianteval package, but this isnt fully fleshed out for general use. Would you be OK finishing this PR with that in place, after which I would be willing to do a separate PR to make that general purpose, or does this need to be done before this?. 3) What do you think about the total size of test files being added? One way to reduce some file sizes is to subset to only the sites relevant to the variant eval tests. In the case of more generic reference files this reduces size, but also lessens their potential utility for future tests that may share them. . Also, the stub from the GATK3 VariantEval3IntegrationTest is still there should you want to run it. It should pass every GATK3 test using GATK3 inputs, though it might take a little work to put all the GATK3 files in the same location (i received them as one data dump in one directory).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-431583201:4,test,tests,4,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-431583201,6,"['stub', 'test']","['stub', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"OK, thanks @ldgauthier, I think I've addressed all the comments but one. A little TODO list for my benefit:. - [x] Updated the GATK version in the ExcessHet documentation to 4.2.2.0, but we'll see if I need to revisit that.; - [x] Not quite sure about the `ReducibleAnnotation` business. Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr. Here are some plots for N = 50, 100, and 500 samples showing (in black) those counts that previously fell under the 3E-6 threshold with the mid-p correction but now pass without it.

Testability,"OK, that's reasonable. I'll dig into the other test changes. I can answer a few:. - Regarding passing the VariantWalker: I agree that's not an improvement by itself, but I would argue it's not that much different than it was. My plan is to pass a VariantEvalContext object, which would obscure any need to have knowledge of the walker. In an attempt to keep this PR simpler, I didnt complete that work. I do expect to make a second PR in relatively short order, once we get this resolved. - With respect to testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields and the different reference: I think the issue is that the old version (master GATK branch) didnt validate as strictly. When switching to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, the reference is required, and the tool will error if the contigs dont match. VariantEval on the master branch didnt really need the reference for anything, and was apparently more permissive if it didnt line up. It probably preferentially grabbed the dictionary from the VCF header.

Testability,"OK, the first test run I tried was with 1kb bins and *no additional normals*. Coverage takes about an hour to collect per BAM and ploidy inference takes about 10 minutes. A few things:. 1) Looks like we are concordant with the truth CN on X for all but 3/40 of the samples. The GQs for these discordant calls are low (~3, 23, and 25 compared with ~400 for most of the others). 2) However, we are striking out on over half of the samples on Y. We mostly call 1 copy when the truth calls 0. Mehrtash thinks this is because a) I didn't mask out any PARs or otherwise troublesome regions on Y and b) I didn't include any other normals. I'll try rerunning with a mask first, then with other normals, and then with both. Hopefully this should clear up with just the mask. 3) There are a few samples where we strike out because the truth calls 2 copies on Y and we call 1. Mehrtash pointed out that this is most likely because the prior table we put together assumes Y can have at most 1 copy. So hopefully these are trivially recovered once we relax this. 4) The GQs are weirdly high on 1, X, and Y compared to the rest of the autosomes. @ldgauthier any idea why this might be?

Testability,"OK. I found a potential solution. For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2. This means that we have only one GKL for both GATK 3 and 4, at the expense of having to keep to config files, `log4j.properties` and `log4j2.xml`, in sync (which they probably should have been anyway, thought they weren't).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413:286,log,log,286,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Ok, I think the main thing is to be able to explain/verify all of the tests where results changed:. - For the snpeff test, since the behavior on this branch seems more correct to me than master, I tried running the GATK4 test case inputs with GATK3, and it produces exactly the same results as this branch does. So I think that issue was introduced by the original GATK4 port, and is fixed in this branch.; - The rest of the tests with changed results don't seem to hit your breakpoint, though. So I think we need to figure out why they changed, and maybe also compare them with GATK3 (which can be a pain because the output format is slightly different).; - As you mentioned, you changed the reference for testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields, which seems to have only affected the number of loci processed. So I'm unclear why that change was necessary. If the test truly should have been failing without this change, will it still fail if the change is reverted ? If not, can we fix it, and either way there should be a negative test for that case. A few other general comments:. - I changed this PR to `draft` mode for now, which just better categorizes it for our internal workflow purposes. When its ready for a detailed code review we can remove the `draft` status.; - The `HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>>` can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place.; - I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round.; - Any new classes/methods should use `final` for variables and parameters wherever applicable, and public classes and methods should have javadoc.; - Finally, I'm",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987:70,test,tests,70,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987,7,['test'],"['test', 'testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields', 'tests']"

Testability,"On branch `ll_CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I have created a CLI called: `CollectAllelicCountsSpark` ... This tool will have the exact same functionality as `CollectAllelicCounts`, to the point where I can re-use the integration tests. However, the integration tests fail. When I dig deeper in `CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I see that only 8 RDDs (correct amount: 11) are being passed to processAlignments... Consider the following code:. ```; @Override; protected void processAlignments(JavaRDD<LocusWalkerContext> rdd, JavaSparkContext ctx) {; final String sampleName = SampleNameUtils.readSampleName(getHeaderForReads());; final SampleMetadata sampleMetadata = new SimpleSampleMetadata(sampleName);; final Broadcast<SampleMetadata> sampleMetadataBroadcast = ctx.broadcast(sampleMetadata);. final AllelicCountCollector finalAllelicCountCollector =; rdd.mapPartitions(distributedCount(sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue(), minimumBaseQuality)); .reduce((a1, a2) -> combineAllelicCountCollectors(a1, a2, sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue()));; final List<LocusWalkerContext> tmp = rdd.collect();; ....snip....; ```. In this case `tmp` will have a size of 8. However, the integration test would indicate a size of 11 is correct, since 11 intervals are being passed in. Note that `emitEmptyLoci()` returns `true`, so 11 is the correct number as seen in `CollectAllelicCountsSparkIntegrationTest` . . Additionally, in (at least) one result, the counts are wrong. `CollectAllelicCounts` (non-spark) passes the integration test. I have tried a couple of tests to gather more information:. - Is `emitEmptyLoci()` causing an issue? ; Does not appear to be causing the issue. I say this because when set to `false`, I get (essentially) the same error.; - The code uses `mapPartition` and not `map`, does this cause the issue? Why are you doing this?; This does not cause the issue. I refactored the code to use `map` and got the exact same issue.

Testability,"On the first question, we definitely appreciate how much work this will take. Often, porting the code is the easy part; developing new tests and test data can be a huge effort. I can try to find out if it would be possible for you to take the tool over - I know this kind of thing has come up before for other tools, but I'd have to ask around to find that out. @vdauwera do you have input on this ?. As for the plugins, currently in your branch `VariantStratification` and `VariantEvaluator` are modeled as Barclay command line plugin descriptors, and I was questioning whether thats necessary. Being a plugin is not necessarily required - `ReadFilter` and `Annotation` are both plugins, but they didn't have to be, and it takes quite a bit of work (again, mostly test development) to get a plugin right. Also, I'd consider the Barclay plugin framework to be pretty developed at this point, so I'd be curious to learn more about what issues you see. And yes, definitely don't check any of the large GATK3 test files into the repo, even temporarily. Take a look at [General guidelines for GATK4 developers](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk#dev_guidelines) if you haven't already. As you pointed out, new GATK4 tests that use smaller files would have to be developed. We'd want those to be included, and passing tests on the CI server, before we started reviewing the branch, so we know we're reviewing code that works and is covered by tests as much as possible. The second commit in my list above would have only your GATK3 java test files, etc (but not the big files, which you appear to have locally).

Testability,"One issue with running gCNV properly and successfully (and perhaps other GATK tools that work with different data types) is that different data types requires running GATK using wildly different choice of several tool arguments. For example -- running gCNV on WES and WGS requires very different choice of the following parameters:. interval-psi-scale (WES: 0.002, WGS: 0.0005); std-log-mean-bias (WES: 10.0, WGS: 1.0); cnv-coherence-length (WES: 100000, WGS: 5000); ... There are two conceivable solutions:. 1) Declaring all such arguments as _required_, removing default values, and effectively forcing the user to do research (documentation, forum, tutorials) and to set the arguments appropriately according to the use case. This solution is not ideal since it delegates the burden to the user. If we have good default values for WES and WGS, it makes sense to somehow include both in the tool. 2) Declaring all such arguments as optional, though, providing a mechanism to allow the user to _start_ with good default values, with the possibility of overriding them. For example, we can add one required argument to set the baseline:; ```; gatk GermlineCNVCaller \; --set-defaults-for-data-type WES; ...; ```; Under the hood, `--set-defaults-for-data-type WES` would set several optional parameters. Also, by running:. ```; gatk GermlineCNVCaller \; --set-defaults-for-data-type WGS; --std-log-mean-bias 1.0 \; --interval-psi-scale 0.0001 \; ...; ```; the user is asking to override `std-log-mean-bias` and `interval-psi-scale` from shipped default values for `WGS` data type.

Testability,"Original behavior during development relied on Spark mllib's computeSVD to return something sensible even if a PoN was built with only one sample; typically this would yield a singular value of 0 and an eigenvector of NaNs (although it can also result in miscellaneous exceptions, depending on how many zeros are contained in the single-row matrix on which we perform SVD). At one point, I added a check that at least one non-negligible singular value was returned (even when building a PoN with multiple samples). This spoiled the ability to build single-sample PoNs (which is useful if you only have a matched pair). I've added more explicit logic about how single-sample PoNs are built. Now we explicitly set both the singular value and eigenvector to zero.

Testability,"Original report by @samuelklee (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/issues/189):; > I noticed that Javadoc @value tags are not being rendered correctly in e.g. https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/9570326304155-ScoreVariantAnnotations-BETA-. I used these tags to specify the variables corresponding to argument names (e.g., StandardArgumentDefinitions#INTERVALS_LONG_NAME instead of intervals , USE_ALLELE_SPECIFIC_ANNOTATIONS_LONG_NAME instead of use-allele-specific-annotations, etc.), and while they show up correctly when rendering the Javadoc within IntelliJ, it seems the same is not true on the GATK website. Is there an easy fix in the code for generating these docs, or should I just avoid using this tag?. My original response:. > I tested this using the new Java 17 doclets in the hope that it would just work, but the result is the same. However, the new Java language model classes make it easy to interpolate these, so I’ll fix this in the barclay Java 17 branch. However, in looking more closely, it's not as easy to fix as I first thought, and the problem is a little deeper than I first realized. Although it's easy to detect these using the new Java 17 apis, it's more difficult to retrieve the actual values. And even then, because the gatkdoc process only consumes a subset of the classes consumed by the javadoc process (it only sees `@DocumentedFeature`s), it's quite easy to reference something in the javadoc comment that can be resolved by javdoc, but not by gatkdoc. But it appears that even the javadoc process isn't rendering these tags correctly. Here is the raw javadoc comment:; ```; * Input VCF file. Site-level annotations will be extracted from the contained variants (or alleles,; * if the {@value USE_ALLELE_SPECIFIC_ANNOTATIONS_LONG_NAME} argument is specified).; ```; The rendering in javadoc (the argument name is missing entirely, but it should be interpolated):; <img width=""780"" alt=""Screen Shot 2023-01-05 at 12 17 43 PM"" src=""https://",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8146:766,test,tested,766,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8146,1,['test'],['tested']

EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor. Not sure if this actually broke things though---need to check. (However, I don't actually think this is a very important use case to support...); - [x] Delete/deprecate/etc. CNN tools/tests as appropriate.

Testability,"Our R dependency is primarily for producing plots. It could be possible to create plots using javascript instead. Javascript plots have several potential advantages but also several major downsides. The biggest and most obvious drawback is that we don't have any code to produce them yet, and they are likely harder to generate and experiment with than R scripts. . The advantage would be that we could avoid requiring an R installation to run hellbender scripts, we could potentially also include interactive plotting or other neat tricks to make the plots more useful. I see 2 possible routes to replacing Rscripts with javascript. The first would be for tools that require graphs to perform some html generation and produce html reports with embedded javascript. The user could then open these in their browser and view the plots ( much like how our test suite report and jacoco is done). . A different option would be to use javascript plotting libraries directly within the jvm to generate SVG. Java 8 has a new javascript engine which is supposed to be reasonably fast and offers access to java objects from within it. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a full DOM like a browser does, so most existing javascript libraries will fall over. It seems like it would take a lot of hacking to get something like d3 to run directly on the jvm. (someone has done something of the kind here: http://jazdw.net/content/server-side-svg-generation-using-d3js) . Other options would be to use the javafx web panes to display a browser directly, or to plot directly on a canvas.

Testability,PR updated after a rebase from a nearly a year old master. @ldgauthier @kachulis please review first (3rd last commit) . @davidbenjamin please review second (2nd last commit) on AlleleLikelihoods changes... these two commit are a bit entangled and would be a bit of work to split it in two PRs. I found a couple of bugs that does not seem to manifest themselves in practice and have splitted marginalization and evidence filtering in two steps. Filtering can use any given criterion (lambda) not necessarelly interval overlap. The last commit gathers changes in test files for the first (main) commit.

All assertUnclipped calls were; removed; - Alignment now check that the read length remains to be consistent with the CIGAR, that the aligned bases span are consistent with the CIGAR and that the number of clipped bases from the read is consistent with the requested clipping; 2. Hard clipping in ClippingOps was buggy, thus we introduced new tests for it.; 3. Text was refactored for readability; 4.

Testability,"R addresses two phasing bugs, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 identified a bug in the phasing algorithm which caused the wrong phase information to be output for scenarios where the first variant in a phase set is homozygous variant and it is followed by het variants in opposite phase. Without this change the het variants were incorrectly placed on the same phase strand because the phase set was tied to the hom var variant, and the algorithm assumed that each het variant could be put in the same phase strand as it because it was on all haplotypes. I've modified the algorithm to keep track, for variants that occur on all haplotypes, of which of the haplotypes have already been used for phasing an upstream ""comp"" variant so that further downstream variants can be checked against the remaining set. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845 showed an example of phase sets being disrupted by the presence of an alternate haplotype that supported an additional, uncalled, variant in the region. In this case there was an alternate haplotype supported by two reads that supported a SNP downstream of two pairs of SNPs in alternate phase. The presence of an additional haplotype causes the phasing algorithm to break the phase sets in the region. I've modified the algorithm to only use haplotypes that support the alternate alleles present in called variants in phasing by modifying the number that we pass as `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.constructPhaseSetMapping()`'s `totalAvailableHaplotypes` parameter. In my opinion this ; fix produces output that is still correct and is much easier to understand (since it only depends on sites that are visible in the output VCF), but if anyone objects to this change please let me know. .

Testability,"Rationale for engine changes:; This tool opens a large number of feature files (TSVs, not VariantContexts) and iterates over them simultaneously. No querying, just a single pass through each.; Issue 1: When a feature file lives in the cloud, it takes unacceptably long (several seconds, typically) to initialize it. A few seconds doesn't seem like a long time, but when there are large numbers of feature files to open, it adds up. This is caused by a large number of codecs (mostly the vcf-processing codecs) opening and reading the first few bytes of the file in the canDecode method. To avoid this I've reversed the order in which we test each codec, checking first if it produces the correct subtype of Feature, and only then calling canDecode. If you don't know what specific subtype you need, you can just ask for any Feature by passing Feature.class. It's much faster that way.; Issue 2: Each open feature source soaks up a huge amount of memory. That's because text-based feature reading is optimized for VCFs, which can have enormously long lines. So huge buffers are allocated. The problem is compounded for cloud-based feature files for which we allocate a large cloud prefetch buffer. (Though that feature can be turned off, which helps a little.) But the biggest memory hog is the TabixReader, which always reads in the index, regardless of whether it's used or not. Tabix indices are very large. To avoid this, I've created a smaller, simpler FeatureReader subclass called a TextFeatureReader that loads the index only when necessary. The revisions allow the new tool to run using an order of magnitude less memory. Faster, too.; Issue 3: The code in FeatureDataSource that creates a FeatureReader is brittle, and tests for various subclasses. To allow use of the new TextFeatureReader, I added a FeatureReaderFactory interface that allows one to ask the codec for an appropriate FeatureReader.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770:637,test,test,637,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Regarding GenomicsDbImport with intervals, here is a quick test. Again, the thing I'm trying to evaluate is whether it matters how I chunk the genome for GenomicsDBImport->GenotypeGVCFs. Downstream of this, I would pass the workspace to GenotypeGVCFs, with --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals. The concern is whether we have variants spanning the intervals of two jobs, and whether separating the jobs would impact calls. In this example, GenotypeGVCFs would run over 1:1050-1150. For example, if we had a multi-NT variant that spanned 1148-1052, we'd want that called correctly no matter what intervals were used for the jobs. I tried using running GenomicsDBImport with -L over a small region, or I ran SelectVariants on the gVCF first (which behaves a little differently), and then used that subset gVCF as input to GenomicsDBImport, where GenomicsDBImport is given the entire contig as the interval. The resulting workspaces will be slightly different, with the latter containing information over a wider region (GenomicsDBIport truncates start/end of the input records to just the target interval). . So if either of these workspaces is passed to GenotypeGVCFs, using --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals and -L 1:1050-1150:. I think any upstream padding doesnt matter. If you have a multi-nucleotide polymorphism that starts upstream of 1050 but spans 1050, this job wouldnt be responsible for calling that. The prior job, which has an interval set upstream of this one should call it. I think GenomicsDbImport's behavior is fine here. If you have a multi-NT variant that starts within 1050-1150, but extends outside (i.e. deletion or insertion starting at 1148), this could be a problem. The GenomicsDB workspace created with the interval 1:1050-1150 lacks the information to score that, right? The workspace created using the more permissive SelectVariants->GenomicsDBImport contains that downstream information and presumably would make the same call as if GenotypeGVCFs was given ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1221558244:59,test,test,59,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1221558244,1,['test'],['test']

We did sequenced two replicates for this sample, one having significantly more coverage than the other.With default GATK4 parameter the duplication was only detected in the sample with the lowest coverage. After inspection of GATK4 parameter we found that it was the downsampling throught the --max-reads-per-alignment-start that was in cause.Indeed, all the reads that contains the duplications are softcliped (see IGV capture below) because the insertion/duplication event is too bigged to be correctly aligned by BWA. This causes all reads containing the duplication to have the same start position in the BAM file. Then, the downsampling based on start position must drastically reduce the signal and the variant is skipped. This explains why the variant was missed at high coverage level and not in the replicates with lower signal.We think that the downsampling should take Softclips into account to be more reliable, but maybe you have a better idea.Also we did some performance evaluation and GATK4 runned faster with the downsampling desactivated. Is it normal ?; ![duplication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53903734/62783152-17f41180-babc-11e9-9ddb-bed3c3042d97.png). #### Steps to reproduce; Run GATK4 with default parameters on the BAM containing the duplication (we can provide a toy). Disable --max-reads-per-alignment-start by switching the value to 0 to enable the identification of the duplication. #### Expected behavior; The duplication should have been found because the downsampling on start position does not take into accout the reads softclips. #### Actual behavior; The duplication is missed at high coverage depth",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6088:206,test,test,206,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6088,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Resolves issue #1370 by exposing the setting for Spark logging level with a separate CLI argument (`--spark-verbosity`). Also stifles overly-verbose executor INFO-level logging by setting the default to WARN. This was much cleaner to implement than just applying the existing `--verbosity` to the Spark context for a few reasons. First, Spark's `INFO` level is far too verbose, but most GATK tools provide useful INFO messages. This gives the user the ability to tune them separately. Also, Spark offers more levels through log4j, and mapping from htsjdk logging levels with a bunch of `if` statements didn't seem ideal. Verbose logging only seems to be a problem with when running `/gatk/gatk` inside the GATK docker (eg PathSeq log files easily in 100's of MB). Strangely, however, I found there was no verbose logging if I cloned GATK inside the docker and rebuilt from source with `gradlew buildAll`. Since I can't pinpoint the cause, I haven't included tests for this, but I don't expect test coverage to drop. Note that Spark generates some INFO logging when the context is initialized. After that, the logging level is corrected.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5825:55,log,logging,55,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5825,10,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'logging', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"SVIntervals are comparable, and provide the same total order as coordinate-sorted BAMs. They can encode any contiguous stretch of bases on the reference, or strand-sensitively on its reverse complement. They can encode 0-length intervals (i.e., locations) to indicate things like the precise, unambiguous location of an insert between two reference bases. They're super light-weight, and cache friendly (no references), and they can be compared and tested for equality quickly and locally. They know how to serialize themselves with Kryo.

The previous commits updating the copy code were preserved when Louis reverted, so there were basically no changes I had to make to get this ""working."" That does leave us with one question now:. When looking into this a little with James and Louis earlier, we realized that the code for setting up the ActiveRegionGenotyper uses a weird partial copy of the standard CLI args method that has existed in the code for whoever knows how long. Conceptually this seems like a bad idea, but changing it now would possibly cause some older tests to fail, if they were based on this faulty method reasoning. Should we try to merge the PR as it is now, with all tests passing, and hopefully consistency with previous behavior, or try to update the logic around this genotyper as well at the same time?

Testability,"Some recent work by the Green Team as well as some evaluations we have done on our own tools have illuminated that the HaplotypeCaller has a non-deterministic output for some sites (a handful of sites across a typical 30x bam). Typically the differences manifest themselves as minor differences in the annotations at a few sites, for example the qual score and annotations might jitter from run to run like the following two variants: ; `9	103454626	.

Testability,"Sorry @cmnbroad, I misunderstood your comment before - what I've got is that it is ok to have beta/experimental for this, but it's obviosly not what you said, so my fault for not reading carefully. In that case, I would like to have a proposal for how to proceed here:. * I will implement the port for the tools in two independent PRs - just direct translation into the new framework, documentation and kebab-case argument style.; * The port for `RealignerTargetCreator` will be similar to this one; * The port for `IndelRealigner` would not have support for n-way output, although it will be fully functional in other ways. The n-way option can be ported in the future as an extra feature if necessary (maybe the communications team can weight in, and tell if it is really a needed feature); * For the first test, which will be removed before merging, I will use the data from the tutorial. This will be the validation for the port before test data valid for the repository is provided; * For the final tests, I will draft the class with the tests from GAKT3 without the data and disabled, waiting for @sooheelee for meaningful tests (or other people from your team). The main idea is to have two PRs with the port validated with the tutorial data, and add other tests similar to the GATK3's ones for extra validation and/or covering missing codepaths using @sooheelee or ported GATK3 data. Does it makes sense, @cmnbroad and @sooheelee?. @sooheelee - I think that the 1000G data can be a good validation if chromosomes 20/21 have realigned reads without a pair mapping on other chromosomes. In that case, some of that reads can be extracted and reset to the state previous to realignment to validate the new tool.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371728774:809,test,test,809,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371728774,6,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Sorry for the late response - I'm only now getting a chance to look at this. I do want to clarify the exact issue you are raising here, do you expect `--force-output-intervals` to write out sites even when there is no evidence in the gvcf? I'm asking because in the issue describing this (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7005) you had mentioned something about how GenomicsDBFeatureReader required a reference and wasn't sure if you were implying GenomicsDB would get that info from the reference. My understanding of `--force-output-intervals` is that it would cause the resulting output to have homref info if there is evidence in the gvcfs (maybe @droazen can clarify/confirm). As such, the fact that you are getting `N` as the REF would suggest that there is no call made for that particular site. In fact, you can see this in the test case you have here. While it doesn't reproduce the issue, if you examine the output vcf file generated by the test:; - Output contains `N` for `20:10-20` but that is expected because the input gvcf says as much for the first 9999901 bases; ```; 20 1 . N <NON_REF> . . END=9999901 GT:DP:GQ:MIN_DP:PL 0/0:0:0:0:0,0,0; ```; - If you instead change `--force-output-intervals` to `20:9999902-9999910` you will notice that the output file now contains those sites with the right bases and corresponding homref calls:; ```; 20 9999902 .

Testability,"Sorry, I completely missed this one in the last weeks. I was waiting for your answer (and @sooheelee's):. 1. I need the test data for the public repository if we would like to reproduce the complete test suite that GATK3 has (see my comment above, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-364866520); 1. The tutorial data might be a possibility for the `IndelRealignment` test suite, but it requires the full reference genome (which is huge and not possible to include in the repository, see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3104#issuecomment-325612165 for more information). @sooheelee might have an idea about the data and if it can be limited to the reference already on the repository (if I am correct, 20 and 21).; 1. This just came out now when I was looking at my port branches, both this and some backup for others part of the code. If the tool is going to be experimental, I would like to know if it is ok to do not have fully featured tools and fill in some issues in the meantime. For example, in this PR the part of the code uncovered by tests is the `known` indels: the main idea is to comment out the code and throw an exception if the argument is specified, saying that it is not supported yet. In the case of `IndelRealignment`, I would like to leave out in the first iteration for the tool the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, to speed up development and add the support for split output later. Once I know this I will close the PR and sent another one with the `RealignmentTargetCreator`. On the other hand, the `IndelRealigner` tool will take a bit longer, because I haven't look at it for the longest time.

Testability,"Sorry, I guess I didn't see your edit pointing out that line of code. I've indeed looked at that test and more---there's a lot of similar duct tape and inconsistent resetting of the RNG throughout the entire test suite. But since I think we can reasonably assume that there's enough duct tape to make things deterministic overall, I don't think it's worth cleaning up the duct tape just to get neater, but equally deterministic behavior. (Or perhaps can you point to instances of persisting non-determinism, e.g. random failures in Travis?). In any case, I think it makes more sense to focus effort on making cleaner tests for the new tools, rather than make an 11th hour effort to revamp these existing tests. Do you agree?. See e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6112 for some related discussion.

Testability,"Still not sure why the tests failed randomly! all XHMM-related tests use their own RNG with fixed seeds and there are no RNG calls in any parallel streams. Therefore, the randomly generated test data must be identical and fully deterministic across all runs. However, it did not appear to be the case! some test runs triggered a bug in HMMPostProcessor (see below) and some runs didn't. I removed a few unnecessary RNGs and the issue is not reproducible anymore. In particular, both XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator had their own RNG but then again, if the tests are run in a deterministic order, it shouldn't matter. The good news is the bug in HMMPostProcessor is fixed; the bad news is, I still don't know why the tests were not deterministic. I bet the failing issue is (magically!) fixed as a result of pulling out the RNG from XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator. If it occurs again, I'll investigate more. - fixed a bug in HMMPostProcessor that required all samples to be queried in the given list of genotyping segments every time (origin of the failing tests: sometimes the randomly generated genotyping segments contained fewer samples than all samples available for genotyping); - got rid of the unnecessary RNG in XHMMModel to make it stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - also made XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - truncated the target list used in XHMM integration tests (cuts down the test time by a factor of 10)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140:23,test,tests,23,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140,9,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Subsampling seems to be the way to go, see #2858. For the record, I did try to implement caching, but this results in excessive cache checking. In general, I think a better solution is to structure code so that expensive global quantities are not unnecessarily recomputed locally. At some point, this sort of undesirable recomputation snuck in during a refactoring of the allele-fraction likelihood code, probably when we tried to make the method for computing site likelihoods pull double duty based on the presence or absence of an allelic PoN. With an allelic PoN, we need to compute a log gamma at each site based on the site-specific bias hyperparameters; without a PoN, we only need to do this once for all sites, since the bias hyperparameters are now global, but the code naively recomputes it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860#issuecomment-335621709:589,log,log,589,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860#issuecomment-335621709,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Suppose the reference haplotype is; TAAGC. . . . TAAGG. . . . and an alt haplotype (SNV at the last G shown) is; TAAGC. . . TAAG**C**. . . Suppose further that we have a read ending in the first TAAGC that has been hard-clipped (to fit the assembly region) to just a 5-base TAAGC stub. Pair-HMM is fully Bayesian and computes the total likelihood of *all* possible alignments of a read to each haplotype. This gives the alt haplotype a factor of 2 advantage because TAAGC matches it in two locations, so there are two perfectly matching alignments instead of one. In log 10 space this is log_10(2) = 0.301, which is greater than our 0.2 threshold for a likelihood to be considered informative. Therefore, by clipping the read and losing the information of its first 96 bases, we end up considering it informative for the wrong haplotype. This can lead to false positives. It *also* causes false negatives because sometimes a read stub from the normal sample get misaligned to the alt haplotype, triggering the normal artifact filter.

Testability,"THe only issue with running PRs on Jenkins is that I would prefer if an ""admin"" (via the comment section -- can be any Broad employee) actually activate the test. Why? Because essentially this enables someone to run arbitrary code on OUR environment. While it's fairly locked down, we want some sort of verification that, at first glance, the code doesn't look like it's going to hack us. Jenkins itself is full of holes that can probably be exploited from a well-crafted job. I'd prefer to mitigate that.

Testability,"Thank you @mehrzads for your contribution. It would appear that this optimization is aimed to incorporate the knowledge that we could never possibly visit a given vertex more than K times in the first K best paths. Since the graphs are prone to exponential expansion of paths this seems like an important safeguard against this exponential expansion of the graph. . Looking at the code and the algorithm behavior it is intending to copy I see that there is a degenerate case in the current code that can cause the results to be order dependent. My belief is that this code can fall over by virtue of the fact that we refuse to make new incoming edges to a given vertex if there are already too many incoming edges for that vertex. Unfortunately this heuristic doesn't strike me as being valid, because those incoming edges can have any weight, including very high weights because they are bad paths through the graph that we created at a previous step. . I think a more correct optimization would be to limit the number of edges we create LEAVING a given vertex. The logic for this is that while we may not necessarily see all of the incoming edges in the correct weight order we will necessarily see all of the leaving edges in the correct order because those paths are pulled off of the priority queue in the correct order. Thus we can safely ignore any additional paths we see leaving a given edge because by construction as they would necessarily have at least one path that is cheaper than all of the paths leaving the current node.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417:1067,log,logic,1067,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Thank you @vruano for your diligent review. I've implemented logger classes to encapsulate the metrics classes. Unfortunately the metrics classes must remain public in order to write output using `MetricsUtils.saveMetrics()`, but at least the tools aren't using them directly. There are two logging class groups - one for Filter and one Score. For Filter, there is an interface `PSFilterLogger` that is implemented by a file-logging class `PSFilterFileLogger` and a dummy class `PSFilterEmptyLogger` that does nothing. There are analogous classes for Score, but there is no Empty logger because it's not actually necessary. This adds a lot of new classes (maybe you can think of a better way) but usage has been greatly simplified. As we discussed in person, I don't think there is a faster way to count the reads in Spark. If you wanted to count the reads as they pass through, you would have to use some kind of atomic type that would be slow. Also it may be impossible to account for cases when tasks fail and restart. @lbergelson @droazen In this PR, I wanted to use htsjdk's MetricsFile and MetricBase classes for writing metrics to a file. I notice that these classes are mostly used for picard-related things. Is this the preferred way to do things? They do force you to expose public variables and also use an upper-case naming convention. On the other hand, they are somewhat convenient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3611#issuecomment-334308160:61,log,logger,61,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3611#issuecomment-334308160,4,['log'],"['logger', 'logging']"

Testability,"Thanks @bbimber, I have the file downloaded, please go ahead and remove it. I have reproduced the seg fault - it is because of one faulty fragment - `WGS_Sept_1117.gdb/QNVO02001147.1$1$28016/__58eb4600-9c95-425e-a585-4bb23b486577140340709598976_1596797671601`. Not sure why, but it seems to be missing a number of files(e.g. `__coords.tdb`) causing the fault. Things work fine if you move the fragment out of the array. . For what its worth, all the samples from the callset.json seem to be represented in the rest of the fragments. So you might be fine with downstream processing with `__58eb4600-9c95-425e-a585-4bb23b486577140340709598976_1596797671601` removed for now. . For our debugging, . 1. Was the GenomicsDBImport run in an update mode at all after an initial import?; 2. Do you have any logs from `gatk GenomicsDBImport` for the `QNVO02001147.1$1$28016` array? ; 3. Was anything reported in the Lustre logs?; 4. I have attached the samples found in the callset.json for the `QNVO02001147.1$1$28016` array, can you confirm these were the expected samples?

Testability,"Thanks @bbimber. Just tested with the files you shared and the book keeping file uncompresses and loads fine. So, no problem on that count. As you have noticed, consolidation is very resource-intensive in GenomicsDBImport. When fragments are not consolidated on-disk during import, they get consolidated in-memory during queries. In this case, it is possible that with 79 fragments and with 10MB(hardcoded currently) being used per fragment per attribute just for consolidation, with memory fragmentation and other internal buffers, we may have run out of memory. Possible solutions -; 1. Can you run with something less that 178 with java heap options `-Xmx178g -Xms178g`, so the native process gets a little more?; 2. There is no way to perform consolidate only from gatk currently. You could try importing another set with the `--consolidate` and possibly the `--bypass-feature-reader` option.; 3. I am working on a fix for consolidation for Cloud Storage mainly, it may perform a little better generally and can point to a gatk branch when created if you are interested. @mlathara, any other ideas?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7674#issuecomment-1042407322:22,test,tested,22,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7674#issuecomment-1042407322,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"Thanks @davidbenjamin. Tests are failing but I think that they are wrong...Here's the deal. In the tests we have SelectVariants (with --trimAlleles) of a two-sample VCF to NA12891.

So somehow, the first line has a non-informative PL omitted from the result, ; while the second line has the non-informative PL included (PL=[0]) in the result. My instinct is that PL=[0] should not appear in the VCF as it is completely uninformative: The length must be 1 since there's only one allele, and a PL or length 1 must be [0]. Do you agree? In that case I can change the expected results and move forward.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3680#issuecomment-335491192:23,Test,Tests,23,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3680#issuecomment-335491192,2,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'tests']"

Testability,"Thanks @kdatta. The branch builds now, but there are a couple of problems that cause several tests to fail, including some existing tests that used to pass. You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class.

Testability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

Testability,"Thanks @ldgauthier, that's definitely thought provoking. Perhaps you are right that for het-non-ref (i.e. 1/2 and similar) genotypes we should consider skipping the strand bias test. I had been assuming, incorrectly, that in a single sample case with a `1/2` genotype that the test would be based on the called alleles, not ref vs. alt. Just thinking out loud about this, I wonder if computing SOR on the `1/2` alleles would catch a small number of incorrect genotypes? I've been doing something analogous with allele balance filtering - whereby I compute a per-sample allele balance and directionality. If the genotype is imbalanced towards ref, I filter the variant. If the genotype is imbalanced towards a different allele I ""correct"" the genotype to be homozygous for that allele. In testing on reference samples from GIAB and PlatGen we are seeing that correct a handful of genotypes where the sample is really hom-alt, but called het due to a high error rate. . I'll read up on how the allele-specific strand bias works because I've never looked at that before. But I wonder if it's possible from the available annotations to get a SOR-like value for each allele that is that allele _vs_ all other alleles?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5698#issuecomment-466538825:177,test,test,177,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5698#issuecomment-466538825,3,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"Thanks a lot for looking into this @sooheelee - I understand the pain of making the small data for the tests, so I really appreciate your work there. I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1. Looking a bit into the code of GATK3, there is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1. Last, bu quite important for me as a developer, I don't have time to spend looking at that engine-level features required to include that argument.

Testability,"Thanks for bringing this up! I actually think that I prefer option 1, although not ideal (since, as you say, it places more burden on the user). The whole point of having generically parameterized models is that we can apply them to many data types. To single out a few with hardcoded sets of defaults seems like a slippery slope to me. (Of course, we should definitely provide defaults for typical data types in *documentation*.) And in the end, I think it is beneficial for users that wish to tweak knobs to do some work to understand what those knobs actually do (even if just at a basic level). The other downside of option 2 is that it might not be immediately obvious from the command line what parameters are being used. For example, if a user chooses a set of defaults but then overrides some of them, we should make it so they don't have to go digging through the logs to see what parameters are actually used in the end. Nor should they have to go back and check what the defaults were for whatever version of the jar they were using at the time. Option 2 might also make it easier to inadvertently override parameters, etc. via command-line typos or copy-and-paste errors---it's much more straightforward to require and check that every parameter is specified once and fallback to a default if not, as we do now. Not to say that we couldn't get around any of these issues in Barclay, but I think it'll require some thought and careful design. Would be interested to hear Engine team's opinions. Finally, one point that I think will become more relevant as our tools and pipelines become more flexible and parameterized: I think we should start thinking of ""Best Practices Recommendations"" less as ""here is the best set of parameters to use with your data"" and more as ""here is *how to find* the best set of parameters to use with your data (for a given truth set, sensitivity requirement, etc.)"".

Testability,"Thanks for comments about the documentation @LeeTL1220 - I fixed them (I hope) trying to explain the logic behind the element tracker. In principle a developer shouldn't care about when to use them, because they should come from a `LocusIteratorByState` or from inside a previous tracker. In addition, the implementation should be (most of the cases) hidden from the API user, which should use `ReadPileup`. The idea of the trackers come from GATK3, so this is a custom port with some design differences. The basic idea is to cache some operations that may be time consuming for large pileups (sorting, split by sample, extract a single sample). I actually haven't test the performance in a proper way, just running some tools in development with the branch and it feels like is faster - in my case I use all the features that are cache: split by sample, retrieving several times single-samples and also calling `fixOverlaps()` (which uses using sorted pileups). I think that because the `LocusIteratorByState` is already splitting by sample, that can improve even more performance, because it will come directly in the state where it can be used by-sample in an efficient way. And maybe, if the tool does not require to split by sample at all, we can add an option to disable that behavior while creating the tracker.

Testability,"Thanks for having a look, David!; (1) I have tested it by running an instrumented BQSR and generating a report for it. I haven't checked in the reporting code yet - it's still very much in flux, and I'm not quite sure where to put it. Perhaps it should even be a separate project, since it's not hellbender-specific.; (2) This class is designed to _not_ being transferred from one machine to another, so the timestamps are consistent. The idea is that a ""START-END"" span corresponds to a piece of work done on a single machine. It could also theoretically correspond to some ""master"" machine sending work and then getting answers back - but in both scenarios, all the log entries from the same operation come from the same machine.; (3) That would be testing log4j, not BunnyLog. I can try to find some way to add a test, sure.; (4) Yes, I started work on the analysis program already. It generates a report of how many times each operation was called, average call time, total CPU time. It also generates a visualization of when things are running.

Testability,"Thanks for taking a look @davidadamsphd. Regarding the singleton pattern, by the looks of things it was introduced for testing with the intention of avoiding the 10+ second overhead of creating the reference table, however `RefAPISourceUnitTest` still builds the table in `queryReferenceAPI` for each test. We could avoid that by using TestNG's `@BeforeClass` to create the `@RefAPISource` just once, as I mentioned above. Otherwise, the API is not called in tests, since a mock `ReferenceDataflowSource` is used. Let's work out a common references interface - @jean-philippe-martin and @akiezun, let me know what you prefer here.

If some representation of indels in such a BAM is sufficient as a truthset, then I can make this VCF. These samples, being from the 1000 Genomes Project, are well-analyzed and their indels will be represented in dbSNP and gnomAD resources.

Once I changed and used my personal account via `gcloud auth application-default login` GATK4 no longer gave that error.

Testability,"Thanks for the response, @droazen! Technically, yes, that would be satisfactory & accurate... and if that's easiest, I'm fine with that. . From a user perspective though, it might be beneficial to report the first occurrence of this error, as that's most likely where I would go back to do future testing & troubleshooting. That being said, all of the overlapping intervals are already outputted to stderr, so all the information is retained regardless, and I could just look through the logs to find that first problematic interval. As an aside, I find it a bit weird that the overlapping interval message shows up as a _warning_ even when using the `-no-overlaps` option (I would assume it would be an error, not a warning). In my experience, most errors cause the program to quit immediately. So, perhaps instead, if this warning were an _error_ when using the `-no-overlaps` option, the program would stop after the first occurrence of this error... and then the error message would be accurate. Maybe that was the original intent of this code. But, again, if that requires much more testing & changes, when a quick rewording would also suffice, there's no need. If it's simply a rewording, I'm happy to make a pull request.

Testability,"Thanks for the review @lbergelson. I have addressed all but one of your comments in a new commit. The only thing I haven't changed is setting the system property to have a default runner.

Having said that, this might not be a common or valid case, so I'm happy to change it.

Testability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

Testability,"Thanks for your feedback, @cmnbroad. In my case, I think that `IntegrationTestSpec` is a good way of avoid complicated code to test tool results, but it is true that it have some problems (one that I had was the usage for testing programs where the outputs are determined by a prefix in the command line, but with different suffixes). I think, from the API user point of view, that a class like `IntegrationTestSpec` to facilitate program output testing (including user exceptions) will be nice for developing purposes. Nevertheless, this is just a convenience that I asked for here, but I can try to solve the issues with the `BaseTest` instead.

Testability,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later. Job 5 *is* doing a lot of computation. It's turning each read into kmers and testing each of those kmers to see if they exist in a large hash table. I don't think there's much opportunity for further optimization -- I knew this would be a bottleneck and tried my best to make the code efficient.

Testability,"Thanks, @droazen. While I understand the effects of the funding landscape on academic resources, it seems to me this is a full capitulation of the GATK developer team given a serious bug, especially in light of the fact that the team seems to have enough resources to continue working on Mutect3. Mutect2 has been one of the best performing variant callers of the last years and is a major reason for the Broad's good reputation in the oncology bioinformatics field. GATK and Mutect2 are used by hundreds of institutions in clinical practice, affecting thousands of real patients' lives. Almost all of these institutions are likely to use clinical WES assays due to cost reasons and will thus have been directly affected by this issue _for the last three years_. Also, almost all of these institutions will never learn of this bug since they likely trusted in the developers to have proper functional regression tests in place. If this is indeed the best the Broad can do as an institution, then I will take your offer of providing a build of Mutect2 4.1.8.1 with the log4j vulnerability patched out - thank you. The one thing that I am asking for in addition (for the sake of the overall oncology bioinformatics community), however, is that you conduct a best effort to notify organizations (universities, hospitals, and biotechs/pharmaceuticals that you know are using Mutect2) and best-practise workflow owners (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL etc. that include Mutect2) of the forced downgrade. Also, I think it makes sense to include a very prominent warning into the Mutect2 READMEs and GATK best practice documentations and guides. I know that this is work, too, but with success comes responsibility, and I can just hope that providing proper warnings uses less developer bandwidth than applying binary search to find out which of these [10 commits between 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 that are touching variant filtering (see below)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0) bro",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1535909226:912,test,tests,912,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1535909226,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Thanks, that's a start. If anyone on the GATK team has thoughts about the other two questions about GenomeLocParser or getting test data, I'd appreciate it. . Based on Daniel's reply: In the GATK3 VariantEval, the walker is counting traversed loci by checking AlignmentContext.getSkippedBases(), and then adding 1 if referenceContext is non-null. From his reply, does this mean it now calls apply() at every locus, meaning getSkippedBases() is irrelevant? In GATK3, would getSkippedBases have come into play if there was zero coverage at a locus? In GATK4, would ReadsContext.getInterval() be the appropriate way to count number of loci being inspected in apply() then?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-337691706:127,test,test,127,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-337691706,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"The ELBO values reported in the log file are supposed to be a smoothed version of the raw ELBO across sliding window average. However, in practice, If you look at these smoothed values rather than the tracked tar file one, one would get a distort impression of how the ELBO converges.

Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, admixture, or population stratification. In order to avoid the latter, HWE tests should be run for each ethnicity/population separately.

Testability,"The SVConcordance tool is currently too inefficient in terms of memory usage, requiring several 100's of GB of heap space on ~100K samples. This PR aims to reduce memory usage in two ways:. 1. Truth VCF records are stripped of all genotype fields except `GT` and `CN`, which are necessary and sufficient for concordance computations.; 2. A new option `--do-not-sort` is introduced to skip output record sorting. A major source of heap usage is the output buffer in the `ClosestSVFinder` class, which ensures records are emitted in coordinate-sorted order. This buffer quickly fills, however, when there is at least one record being actively clustered that spans a large interval because the buffer cannot be flushed until a variant beyond the maximal clusterable coordinate of that large variant is encountered. This option will allow users to substantially reduce max heap usage on larger call sets (a single SVRecord can consume ~100MB with 100K samples).

Testability,"The VCF input I used is dbsnp_138.b37.excluding_sites_after_129.vcf, at 2.3 GB.; It takes 0.47min to copy over. The local computation itself is only a few seconds:; 0.04min on the 4-cpu machine,; 0.05min on the 1-cpu machine,; 0.07min on the 1-cpu machine when ASYNC is on. Running with NIO takes:; 0.21min on the 4-cpu machine,; 0.59min on the 1-cpu machine,. A lot of the IO is done by the network card or operating system, so while we're prefetching on that thread, other threads can make progress. Not all of it, of course, so we pay a little bit of a cost as we have to switch between threads. The best scenario is one where there is both a lot of IO and a lot of computation, so we win most by overlapping them. The VCF case here is borderline because there is so little computation. The fact that we can make progress during IO is confirmed by the ""whole file"" case, where doing the reading and computation in parallel is faster than doing the copy first, then compute - even on a single-core VM. You're asking about `use_async_io_write_tribble`. I didn't set it explicitly and my logs show it was turned off in every experiment:; `INFO SelectVariants - Defaults.USE_ASYNC_IO_WRITE_FOR_TRIBBLE : false`.

We've seen this happen when the CNN Python inference code runs out of memory.

Testability,"The advantage of using SLF4J is that it is a general facade, so it makes simpler to change for one logging system to other if the bound is implemented. For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general. Regarding features, I'm not using more that what log4j is providing, but I'm quite familiar with logback and I have a bias to use it if possible, but the GATK framework as it is implemented now ""force"" to use log4j.

However, we are now applying VETS to long-read genotyping of SVs, where inversions satisfy the same criterion but are then awkwardly classified as SNPs.

Testability,"The goal of this PR is to investigate if what needs doing to compile GATK and run its tests on Java 11. Some notes:. * The Scala 2.12 version of Spark 2.4 is needed to run on Java 11. I disabled `ADAMKryoRegistrator` in this branch since the version we are using is compiled against Scala 2.11. We might consider removing it entirely and no longer support ADAM formats directly in GATK - the workaround would be to use ADAM to convert to/from BAM/VCF. ADAM is also needed for reading 2bit files.; * Java 11 deprecates some APIs. Most of these are fairly easy to fix or suppress. The exception is the Javadoc API [com.sun.javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.javadoc/com/sun/javadoc/package-summary.html), which has been replaced by [jdk.javadoc.doclet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.javadoc/jdk/javadoc/doclet/package-summary.html). The javadoc tools in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.help` may need to be re-written (and it's not clear if it's possible to support Java 8 and Java 11 simultaneously).; * Travis build. Getting this to build and test on Java 11 in addition to the current builds may be fairly involved as the matrix is already quite complicated. (The current PR just changes Java 8 to Java 11 for testing purposes - we'd need a way of getting both to run.). The vast majority of tests are passing on Java 11, the following are failing:; * Missing `TwoBitRecord` (from ADAM); * `ReferenceMultiSparkSourceUnitTest`; * `ImpreciseVariantDetectorUnitTest`; * `SVVCFWriterUnitTest`; * `DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSAMSparkIntegrationTest`; * `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSparkIntegrationTest`; * `SvDiscoverFromLocalAssemblyContigAlignmentsSparkIntegrationTest`; * `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.clear()Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;`; * `SeekableByteChannelPrefetcherTest`; * `GatherVcfsCloudIntegrationTest`; * `Could not serialize lambda`; * `ExampleAssemblyRegionWalkerSparkIntegrationTest`; * `PileupSpa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6119#issuecomment-527179359:86,test,tests,86,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6119#issuecomment-527179359,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"The latest code in htsjdk, which includes https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/1454 (changes the Allele class into an interface, and uses SimpleAllele as the concrete implementation) causes the `VariantAnnotatorEngineUnitTest.testCombineAnnotations` test to fail because the order of the list returned by `ReducibleAnnotationData.getAlleles` is different with that change than it is without it (presumably due to the different hashCode/equals implementations). `AS_RMSMappingQuality.parseRawData` seems to assume that the order of the Alleles in the list returned by ; `ReducibleAnnotationData.getAlleles` exactly matches the order of the raw data in the String returned by `ReducibleAnnotationData.getRawData`, since it uses indexed access to the list, but I don't see anything that states or ensures/enforces this. Changing the Map maintained by `ReducibleAnnotationData` into a LinkedHashMap fixes the issue for this test, but that just changes the order to be input order - the real issue is that the contract around how the order of the list and the order of the raw data is maintained isn't clear.

Testability,"The marginalization over all paths, not the the likeliest one, would make a small difference, but I'm not sure in which direction. In fact, I would even guess it would tend to favor the reference over a deletion because there are more contributions from things like TTTTT -> TT(DELETE A T)TT(INSERT A T)T that don't actually change the bases but do contribute to the sum. That is, if the reference has a longer poly-T, there are more places to put the cancelling deletion(s) and insertion(s). However, all this stuff incurs gap opening penalties and I would be surprised if it could make a difference as big as 0.07. I think I know what can, however. If you take a look at the top of page 3 of our pair-HMM docs https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/docs/pair_hmm.pdf, you will see, as @yfarjoun guessed, that there is a preference for shorter haplotypes in the form of a 1/haplotype length factor. And in fact, this amount seems to be in the right ballpark. For example, @ldgauthier's case is a 28-base deletion. If you calculate the log_10 ratio of the 1/length factors assuming a 100-base deletion haplotype, you get log_10(128/100) = 0.107. This, by the way, would explain why we don't see this sort of thing with insertions. We could simply say that any uninformative read (a log likelihood difference of 0.2) should go to the reference if that is the second best. That's basically the prior I was talking about. The M2-only solution would be to use the somatic likelihoods model on the haplotypes and remove unsupported haplotypes from the likelihoods matrix. Similarly, I could use it to align reads to the haplotype with the greatest posterior probability.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829#issuecomment-393547216:1294,log,log,1294,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829#issuecomment-393547216,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"The point of the second test is to make sure that the new code path involving the spanning deletion has no effect if the spanning deletion has low likelihood. You could imagine that I introduced a bug where you lose sensitivity whenever a spanning deletion appears in the alleles list even if there's very little evidence for it, just because its potential existence sends the code down some new, incorrect, logic. I think `testSpanningDeletionIsNotConsideredVariant` is already doing what you want because before this fix the example VC is definitely considered to be variant even though the only non-ref evidence is for the symbolic `*` allele. The PLs in this example are 50, 100, 100, 0, 100, 100, which means that it is overwhelmingly likely that this sample's genotype is REF/SPAN_DEL. In the old code you get a qual of about 50 (the hom ref PL), whereas in the new code you get that the chances of a variant are about 1 in 10^10 since the only truly variant PLs are 100. Now, if you think a multi-sample case would be useful that sounds good to me. However, a ""confident deletion in sample1 and a low quality SNP in sample2"" would not look very different since the deletion would only exist in an upstream VC, not the VC being tested, so basically we would have sample1 = REF/SPAN_DEL, sample2 = REF/SNP with low quality.

Testability,"The problem currently with having everything in one repo is that we have no way of automatically testing on PPC. So an Intel engineer (for example) making a change to the x86 implementation would have to also find a way to manually test on PPC, which adds considerably to the testing/development burden. With separate repos, a change in the AVX repo wouldn't affect the PPC repo until the maintainer of the PPC repo updated it (after doing appropriate testing of their own), since the PPC repo would depend on a tagged version of the AVX repo. There could also still be some level of code sharing between the two implementations, since the PPC repo would pull in the AVX repo as a dependency. If someone could provide us with a means of automatically testing on PPC, with ability to see the test status on github, then I think we'd be more open to the idea of a single repo.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1748#issuecomment-215127556:97,test,testing,97,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1748#issuecomment-215127556,6,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"The recent branch #8489 has demonstrated that there are some problematic edge cases in the pileup allele merging code that could cause pathological numbers of haplotypes to be handed to the genotyper. In updating the bug in that branch it was observed that it is very common that there are score ties at the 5th haplotype level for the pileupcaller as illustrated by the noise in the updated tests. This algorithm is not a good heuristic and we should replace it with something better, some ideas from that branch that might fix a few of its shortcomings:. 1) Increase/decouple the kmer size used with the reads from the assembly graph kmer size to prevent the filtering step from being redundant with assembly; 2) Normalize the scores to the haplotype lengths to deal with haplotype size bias.; 3) Change the scores to instead reflect the absolute count of unsupported kmers from the graph to also deal with hapotype size bias. ; 4) Iteratively expand the kmer size used for filtering to pare down the number of haplotypes in a more principled fashion.; 5) Utilize the read kmer occurrence counts to construct the scores in order to reduce the risk of spurious reads being sufficient support for a given haplotype. . We have observed that there can be significant changes to the actual genotyping engine output from the pileup engine from even relatively minor changes to the pileupcalling merging code. We should strive to find a more principled solution for merging haplotypes than the one we have currently.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8494:392,test,tests,392,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8494,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"There is going to be a behavior different between the old iteration pattern. The existing code will iterate variants to establish whitelist of start sites, and then re-query variants overlapping those starts. This is generally identical in practice to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart; however, when -L is supplied, it can give differences. I'm not sure which I think is correct. . Example, from VariantEvalIntegrationTest.testFunctionClassWithSnpeff():. // The DbSNP VCF has two variants:; // 1 1423281 rs374004343 GGAAGC G . .; // 1 1423281 rs79849353 G A . .; // If we use 1423281 as the interval, we find both. // The SnpEff VCF has these two:; // 1 1423282 . GAAGC G; // 1 1423286 . C G. The SnpEff VCF is provided as -L when running the tool. Both SnpEff and DbSnp will be used as drivingVariants. Therefore when we hit interval 1423282, the DbSnp variant 1423281:GGAAGC>G variant will be included, but not 1423281:G>A. When using MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, this means only that variant is passed downstream. Previously, VariantEval would simply establish the whitelist of start sites (meaning the lowest from the group, or 1423281) and iterate them. This means that even though 1423282 is the interval from -L, it picks up the overlapping 1423281:GGAAGC>G, which effectively makes 1423281 a whitelisted start site. The existing behavior would iterate each start site and re-query overlapping variants in VariantEvalUtils.bindVariantContexts(). It would call:. List<VariantContext> prior = featureContext.getValues(track, referenceContext.getInterval().getStart());. In this instance, it would query on start=1423281, meaning it picked up both DbSnp sites, even though 1423281:G>A is not within the intervals supplied by -L. This is sort of a fringe case. I dont see how to fix this without reintroducing the expensive re-query step. I'm currently thinking that the existing behavior is probably what's wrong, but I'm going to consider this a little more.

Testability,"There were a couple of things I needed to do to get the new Spark code running on a cluster:. i. Go back to using Spark's version of Kryo. Using a different version of Kryo is not actually needed (2.21 used by Spark passes the tests), and actually caused errors on the cluster when run with `--conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true` (which is needed to avoid other library conflicts, like with jopt-simple). ii. Exclude Spark from the JAR file to avoid library conflicts. It's normal to exclude Spark and Hadoop from JAR files since they are supplied by `spark-submit`. Since Gradle doesn't have a 'provided' dependency (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/issues/836), I had to do a bit of a workaround with the `shadowJar` target, which is now `sparkJar`. .

Testability,"There were a few issues with this case. First, the data source was not constructed 100% correctly. The config file is correct. . The index file is for the tar.gz version of the source data and not for the uncompressed version that they're using. The index should correspond to the source data in the file referenced by the config file itself (not a zipped or otherwise transformed version). Secondly, the source `tsv` data file has the header line for the table commented out. The Xsv codec is aware of leading hash marks as comments and will ignore any such lines. Because of this, the leading hash in the table header is ignored and the file cannot be properly parsed. The fix is simple - just remove the leading hash from the table header (the preceding line with the two hash marks is correctly interpreted as a file header because of the leading hashes acting as comments). Lastly, even if the user fixed the file they would still need to index it with`IndexFeatureFile`. At some point the code underlying this in `HTSJDK` was broken such that no Xsv files can currently be indexed.

Again, that does not happen all that often because Picard-public is stable. . Picard-private is a very different beast and Hellbender is not touching that at all. The big unanswered question is, what happens to the picard/picard-private dependency. I suggest we can try the following cannibalistic approach to Picard-public: logically Picard-public has three parts (utilities, tools and the rest (command line parsing etc)).; a) parts of Picard-public that are generally useful utilities should be moved down to htsjdk.; b) tools from Picard-public will move to Hellbender and live there; c) what remains are things like commandline processing etc. That part can be moved over to picard private and live there (Hellbender will have its own cmd line processing, and it would not be desirable, at least initially, to make picard-private depend on hellbender).; At that point, all functionality from Picard-public will be somewhere else and so Picard-public will cease to exist as a separate entity and the public/private dependency will be obsolete.

Testability,"These are a bunch of random, mostly just annoying things that I repeatedly encountered during the Java 17 port that we should look into. . **Log Spam Issues:** (these result in lots of error log spam that make the logs super hard to scan when there is a failure):. - The WDL test logs are riddled with “localization by hard link failed” and ""Docker not found"" failures, which makes it hard to scan them for real failures. Can we eliminate/fix these ?; - The logs have a few gradle task dependency warnings - we should hunt down the cause. ; - We routinely pull ~800 branches every time we run git clone for a CI job. Can we do shallow git clones?; - We're using deprecated gradle features that result in warnings in the logs, these should be updated.; - The test runner seems to serialize (via toString) every argument to every test method. Many of these have *huge* ""toString"" representations (i.e., `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.spark.sv.integration.ExtractOriginalAlignmentRecordsByNameSparkIntegrationTest`) that fill the logs with reams of huge test values. We should codify/unify the test case wrapper class that we use in htsjdk for these cases. . **Other Issues:**. - We should review the shadowJar contents - it includes some surprising stuff (i.e., the publish-picard.sh script we use to publish picard).; - Do we still need the unpacktestjar task in `dockertest.gradle`, to work around testNG inability to find tests in a jar ?; - The test matrix job names all look the same in the github UI because only the first N characters are displayed, and they all have the same prefix. We should rename them so they start with unique prefixes.; - The library it.unimi.dsi:fastutil:7.0.61 appears to not be used [Fix] (reported in IntelliJ/Project Structure/Problems).; - It's non-intuitive that the *Dockerfile* builds the `run_unit_tests.sh` script.

You could pretend that we started with simulated BAMs that were all aligned w.r.t. this fictional reference/dictionary. (It's just more work to simulate at the BAM level, which is why we start with the counts; simulating BAMs would also not increase test coverage in any meaningful way.). There are already a number of checks to guarantee dictionary consistency, but as you can see from that issue, there are a few scenarios where dictionaries from intervals might not be available via the engine. I don't think there should be a need to provide or check against external references/dictionaries at downstream steps; see point 4 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-719576249 about reverting the code change to allow external dictionaries in PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls.

Testability,"Think it might be worth saving a VariantFiltration pass for the bit of code it'd take, but up to you!. ScoreVariantAnnotations will output both the raw ""VQSLOD"" score and the converted sensitivity, so we're free to specify thresholds on either. However, given that different types of models may have scores in different ranges (e.g., BGMM vs. IsolationForest, positive/negative vs. positive-only, etc.), I think it's better to restrict all command-line options to be expressed in terms of a sensitivity. Same thing goes if you decide to filter externally with VariantFiltration for now. Even though you have both quantities available to you, just use the sensitivity. This brings us to questions related to whether we want to keep the old VQSR requirements of having both training and truth sets specified. For example, we could instead drop the distinction between training and truth for the new tools, and always calibrate sensitivity to the training set (you can essentially force this behavior with the current code by specifying training=true,truth=true for all of your resources). And yes, all of the tools should have a variety of command lines in the tests to demonstrate behavior. If you want to explore positive/negative mode, take a look at the *Unlabeled tests.
