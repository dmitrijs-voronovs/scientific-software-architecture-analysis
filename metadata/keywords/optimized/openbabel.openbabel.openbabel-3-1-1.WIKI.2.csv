Performance,"molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds. Under the hood is a chemical registration technology based on Open Babel. The simplest query language for chemistry is SMILES itself: Just; specify a structure, such as Oc1ccccc1, and search. This is how; eMolecules’ basic searching works (see Sidebar). It’s simple and, because of the; high-performance indexes in eMolecules, is also very fast.; However, for general-purpose cheminformatics, one needs more power.; What if the substructure you’re looking for isn’t a valid molecule?; For example ClccBr (1,2- substitution on an aromatic ring) isn’t a; whole molecule, since the concept of aromaticity is only sensible; in the context of a whole ring system.; Or what if the thing we’re looking for isn’t a simple atom such as; Br, but rather a concept like “Halogen”? Or, “A terminal methyl”?; To address this, cheminformatics systems have special; query languages, such as SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target; Specification). SMARTS is a close cousin to SMILES, but it has; expressions instead of simple atoms and bonds. For example, [C,N]; will find an atom that is either carbon or nitrogen.

Performance,"n theory one can create a canonical connection table,; too, but it’s not as useful since informatics systems usually have; trouble indexing BLOBs - large objects.). Line Notation versus Connection Tables: A practical matter#; Why are line notations preferred over connection-table formats? In; theory, either could express the same information. But there are; practical difference, mostly related to the complexity of “parsing”; a connection table. If you know that the whole molecule is on one; line of a file, it’s easy to parse.; Line notations are also very nice for database applications.; Relational databases have datatypes that, roughly speaking, are; divided into numbers, text, and “everything else”, also known as; “BLOBs” (Binary Large OBjects). You can store line notations in the; “text” fields much more easily than connection tables.; Line notations also have pragmatic advantages. Modern Unix-like; systems (such as UNIX, Linux and Cygwin) have a number of very; powerful “filter” text-processing programs that can be “piped”; together (connected end-to-end) to perform important tasks. For; example, to count the number of molecules containing aliphatic; nitrogen in a SMILES file, I can simply:; grep N file.smi | wc. (grep looks for a particular expression, in this case N, and; prints any line that contains it, and wc (“word count”) counts the; number of words and lines.); This is just a simple example of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines.

Performance,"nable structure for 3D display? Or are you looking; for a structure close to the global minimum?; To use from obabel, see the help for the conformer operation (obabel -L conformer). This operation is used both for conformer searching and for the genetic algorithm conformer generation described below.; Here is an example of use from Python:; >>> ff = ob.OBForceField.FindForceField(""mmff94""); >>> ff.Setup(obmol); True; >>> print(ff.Energy()); 15.179054202; >>> ff.SystematicRotorSearch(100); >>> print(ff.Energy()); 10.8861155747. Gen3D#; To illustrate how some of the above methods might be used in practice, consider the gen3d operation. This operation (invoked using --gen3d at the commandline) generates 3D structures for 0D or 2D structures using the following series of steps, all of which have been described above:. Use the OBBuilder to create a 3D structure using rules and fragment templates; Do 250 steps of a steepest descent geometry optimization with the MMFF94; forcefield; Do 200 iterations of a Weighted Rotor conformational search (optimizing each; conformer with 25 steps of a steepest descent); Do 250 steps of a conjugate gradient geometry optimization. Taken together, all of these steps ensure that the generated structure is likely to be the global minimum energy conformer. However, for many applications where 100s if not 1000s of molecules need to be processed, gen3d is rather slow:. --fastest only generate coordinates, no force field or conformer search; --fast perform quick forcefield optimization; --medium (default) forcefield optimization + fast conformer search; --better more optimization + fast conformer search; --best more optimization + significant conformer search.

Performance,"onfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived then stereo perception is not performed. Any operations that require stereo information should call PerceiveStereo before accessing stereo information.; Behind the scenes, the code for stereo perception is quite different depending on the dimensionality (OBMol::GetDimension()) of the molecule.; 3D structures; Perhaps the most straightforward is when the structure has 3D coordinates. In this case, a symmetry analysis identifies stereogenic centers whose stereoconfigurations are then perceived from the coordinates. Some file formats such as the MOL file allow atoms and double bonds to be marked as have unspecified stereochemistry, and this information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:9201,perform,performed,9201,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['perform'],['performed']

To confirm that the search; system has found something relevant, it must check the pages return; from the index to ensure that the specific phrase “John Hartford”; is present. However, notice that this is much faster than; searching every page, since the overwhelming majority of web pages; were instantly rejected because they have neither “John” nor; “Hartford” on them.; Similarly, a chemical fragment index serves to find only the most; likely molecules for our substructure match - anything that the; index didn’t find is definitely not a match. But we still have to; examine each of the molecules returned by the indexing system and; verify that the complete substructure for which we are searching is; present. NP-Complete - A Little about Computability#; Searching through a page of text for the words “John Hartford” is; pretty easy for a modern computer. Although false positives; returned by the index are a nuisance and impair performance, they; are not a catastrophe. Not so for substructure matching.; Unfortunately, substructure matching falls into a category of; “hard” mathematical problems, which means false positives from the; index are a big problem.; Substructure matching (finding a certain functional group within a; molecule) is an example of what mathematicians call; graph isomorphism,; and is in a class of problems called; NP Complete.; Roughly speaking, this means the time it takes to do a substructure; search is non-polynomial, i.e. exponential in the number of atoms; and bonds. To see why this is a computational disaster, compare two; tasks, one that takes polynomial time,; k1*N2, versus one that takes exponential; time k2*2N. Our polynomial task is bad; enough: If we double N, it takes four times as long to solve. But; the exponential task is worse:; Every time we add an atom it doubles.

Performance,"ounding the molecule are contained by; the Spectrophore. On the other hand, low resolution settings may lead to a more; general representation of the property fields, with little or no emphasis on; small local variations within the fields. Using a low resolution can be the; method of choice during the initial virtual screening experiments in order to get; an initial, but not so discriminative, first selection. This initial selection; can then further be refined during subsequent virtual screening steps using a; higher resolution. In this setting, small local differences in the fields between; pairs of molecules will be picked up much more easily.; The absolute values of the individual Spectrophore data points are dependent; on the used resolution. Low resolution values lead to small values of the; calculated individual Spectrophore data points, while high resolutions will; lead to larger data values. It is therefore only meaningful to compare only; Spectrophores that have been generated using the same resolution settings or; after some kind of normalization is performed.; Computation time is not influenced by the specified resolution and hence; is identical for all different resolution settings. Stereospecificity#; Some of the cages that are used to calculated Spectrophores have a; stereospecific distribution of the interaction points. The resulting; interaction values resulting from these cages are therefore sensitive to the; enantiomeric configuration of the molecule within the cage. The fact that both; stereoselective as well as stereo non-selective cages can be used makes it; possible to include or exclude stereospecificity in the virtual screening; search. Depending on the desired output, the stereospecificity of; Spectrophores can be specified by the user using the -s option:.

Safety," Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others. It gains by way of its users, contributors, developers, related projects, and the general chemical community. We must continually strive to support these constituencies.; We gratefully accept contributions in many forms – from bug reports, complaints, and critiques, which help us improve what we do poorly, to feature suggestions, code contributions, and other efforts, which direct our future development. For end users, we seek to provide a range of utility, from simple (or complex) file interconversion, to indexing, databasing, and transforming chemical and molecular data.; For developers, we seek to provide an easy-to-use free and open source chemical library. This assists a variety of chemical software, from molecular viewers and visualization tools and editors to databases, property prediction tools, and in-house development. To this end, we hope that our tools reflect several key points:. As much chemical information and files should be read and understood by Open Babel. This means that we should always strive to support as many concepts as possible in a given file format, and support for additional file formats is beneficial to the community as a whole.; Releases should be made to be “as good as we can make it” each and every time.; Improving our code and our community to bring in additional contributions in many forms helps both developers and end-users alike. Making development easy for new contributors will result in better tools for users as well. previous; Introduction. next; Frequently Asked Questions. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

Safety," that for some doubly deficient species, like carbene; CH2 and oxygen atoms, the singlet and triplet species are fairly close; in energy and both may be significant in certain applications such; as combustion, atmospheric or preparative organic chemistry, so it; is convenient that they can be described separately. There are of; course an infinity of other electronic configurations of molecules; but Open Babel has no special descriptors for them. However, even; more hydrogen-deficient atoms are indicated by the highest possible; value of spinmultiplicity (C atom has spin multiplicity of 5).; (This extends MDL’s RAD property which has a maximum value of 3.); If the spin multiplicity of an atom is not input explicitly, it is; set (in :obapi:`OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity() <OpenBabel::OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity>`) when the input format is; MOL, SMI, CML or Therm. This routine is called after all the atoms; and bonds of the molecule are known. It detects hydrogen deficiency; in an atom and assigns spin multiplicity appropriately. But because; hydrogen may be implicit it only does this for atoms which have at; least one explicit hydrogen or on atoms which have had; :obapi:`ForceNoH() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::ForceNoH>` called for them - which is effectively zero explicit; hydrogens. The latter is used, for instance, when SMILES inputs [O]; to ensure that it is seen as an oxygen atom (spin multiplicity=3); rather than water. Otherwise, atoms with no explicit hydrogen are; assumed to have a spin multiplicity of 0, i.e with full complement; of implicit hydrogens.; In deciding which atoms should be have spin multiplicity assigned,; hydrogen atoms which have an isotope specification (D,T or even 1H); do not count. So SMILES N[2H] is NH2D (spin multiplicity; left at 0, so with a full content of implicit hydrogens), whereas; N[H] is NH (spin multiplicity=3). A deuterated radical like NHD is; represented by [NH][2H]. In radicals either the hydrogen or the spin multiplicity can be ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html:3558,detect,detects,3558,docs/Features/Radicals.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html,1,['detect'],['detects']
Safety," the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON.

When adding a regression test for a bug fix, the test should fail without the fix, but pass afterwards.; When adding a test for a new feature, the test should provide complete coverage for all code paths.; Test not just perfect input, but all sorts of dodgy input like molecules with no atoms, empty strings, and so forth.; Don’t be afraid to add tests for things which you already (think you) know will pass; such tests may surprise you, and even if they don’t they will prevent regressions. Potential problems/gotchas:. Why isn’t your Python test being run? Test functions name must begin with the word test.; If your new test passes first time, check that it is actually running correctly, by changing your asserts so that they should fail.; The C++ tests will be marked as failing if the test writes any of the following to stdout: ERROR, FAIL, Test failed.

Which prints:; Looking towards atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged anticlockwise. To check whether two Configs represent the same stereo configuration, use the equality operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’.

This section focuses on the --filter option, which is very versatile and can select a subset of molecules based either on properties imported with the molecule (as from a SDF file) or from calculations made by Open Babel on the molecule.; The aim has been to make the option flexible and intuitive to use; don’t be put off by the long description.; You use it like this:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""MW<130 ROTATABLE_BOND > 2"". It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight.

Safety,"mes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol files with code from mdlformat. The calling format should not use the code directly but should do it through a OBConversion object configured with the appropriate helper format.; The objects passed between the modules in the diagram above are polymorphic :obapi:`OBBase` pointers. This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., mol",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:7199,recover,recover,7199,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['recover'],['recover']

Safety,"rception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived then stereo perception is not performed. Any operations that require stereo information should call PerceiveStereo before accessing stereo information.; Behind the scenes, the code for stereo perception is quite different depending on the dimensionality (OBMol::GetDimension()) of the molecule.; 3D structures; Perhaps the most straightforward is when the structure has 3D coordinates. In this case, a symmetry analysis identifies stereogenic centers whose stereoconfigurations are then perceived from the coordinates. Some file formats such as the MOL file allow atoms and double bonds to be marked as have unspecified stereochemistry, and this information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; IC=CC[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -as -osmi; IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F. As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on th",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:9847,detect,detected,9847,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['detect'],['detected']
Safety,"ression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight. You can see a list of available descriptors using:; obabel -L descriptors. or from a menu item in the GUI. Faster filtering; Open Babel provides a number of utility file formats (see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see Copy raw text (copy)). This copies the content of the molecular file directly from input to output. If you are not converting the molecules between different formats, this procedure is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition, if you are converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:17650,avoid,avoids,17650,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['avoid'],['avoids']

Safety,"romaticity models) would not yield the same canonical SMILES string.; Of course, if the SMILES string came from Open Babel in the first place, we are doing unnecessary work when we keep reapplying the same aromaticity model. In this case, you can speed things up by using the a option, so that the aromaticity information present in the input is retained. The following examples show this in action:; $ obabel -:cc -osmi; C=C; $ obabel -:cc -osmi -aa; cc. Effect of modifying the structure#; Perhaps surprisingly, modifying the structure has no effect on the existing aromaticity flags; deleting an atom does not mark aromaticity as unperceived, nor indeed does any other change to the structure such as changing the atomic number of an atom or setting its charge; nor does the use of Begin/EndModify() affect the aromaticity flags. The only way to ensure that aromaticity is reperceived after modifying the structure is to explicitly mark it as unperceived.; The rationale for this is that an efficient toolkit should avoid unnecessary work. The toolkit does not know if a particular modification invalidates any aromaticity already perceived, or even if it did know, it cannot know whether the user actually wishes to invalidate it. It’s up to the user to tell the toolkit. This places more responsibility in the hands of the user, but also more power.; To illustrate, let’s consider what happens when the user reads benzene from the SMILES string c1ccccc1, and then modifies the structure by deleting an aromatic atom.; As this is an aromatic SMILES string, the SMILES reader will mark all atoms and bonds as aromatic. Next, the molecule itself is marked as not having aromaticity perceived (see previous section).

Safety,"ter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; with obabel, no such restriction applies. Because of the original design of babel, it is not possible to add this capability in a backwards-compatible way.; obabel has a shortcut for entering SMILES strings. Precede the SMILES by -: and use in place of an input file. The SMILES string should be enclosed in quotation marks. For example:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C"" -ocan. More than one can be used, and a molecule title can be included if enclosed in quotes:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C aspirin"" -:""Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O salicylic acid""; -ofpt. obabel cannot use concatenated single-character options.

While more verbose, the new arrangement is in line with standard practice and helps avoid conflict with a different Python project, PyBEL. Handling of elements and related information#; The API for interconverting atomic numbers and element symbols has been replaced for performance reasons. The OBElementTable class has been removed and its associated functions are now available through the OBElements namespace:; // OB 2.x; OBElementTable etab;; const char *elem = etab.GetSymbol(6);; unsigned int atomic_num = etab.GetAtomicNum(elem);. // OB 3.0; #include <openbabel/elements.h>; const char *elem = OBElements::GetSymbol(6);; unsigned int atomic_num = OBElements::GetAtomicNum(elem);. Furthermore, the OBAtom API convenience functions for testing for particular elements (e.g. IsHydrogen()) have been removed. Instead, OBAtom::GetAtomicNum() should be used along with an element constant or atomic number:; // OB 2.x; if (atom->IsCarbon()) {... // OB 3.0; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == OBElements.Carbon) {...; // or; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == 6) {...

Security," As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Security," Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -aS -osmi; FC(F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br.

Chemical Registration systems are additionally concerned; with:. Structural novelty - ensure that each compound is only; registered once; Structural normalization - ensure that structures with; alternative representations (such as nitro groups, ferrocenes, and; tautomers) are entered in a uniform way.; Structure drawing - ensure that compounds are drawn in a uniform; fashion, so that they can be quickly recognized “by eye”.; Maintaining relationships among related compounds. For example,; all salt forms of a compound should be recognized as being related; to one another, and compounds in different solvates are also; related.; Registering mixtures, formulations and alternative structures.; Registering compounds the structure of which is unknown.; Roles, responsibilities, security, and company workflow.; Updates, amendments and corrections, and controlling propagation; of changes (e.g. does changing a compound change a mixture; containing that compound?).

Security," Wisswesser in the early 1950’s, was the; first comprehensive line notation, capable of representing; arbitrarily complex molecules correctly and compactly.; 1H = CH4 Methane; 2H = CH3-CH3 Ethane; 3H = CH3-CH2-CH3 Propane; QVR BG CG DG EG FG = C7HCl5O2 Pentachlorbenzoate. WLN was the first line notation to feature a canonical form, that; is, the rules for WLN meant there was only one “correct” WLN for; any particular molecule. Those versed in WLN were able to write; molecular structure in a line format, communicate molecular; structure to one another and to computer programs. Unfortunately,; WLN’s complexity prevented widespread adoption. The rules for; correct specification of WLN filled a small book, encoding those; rules into a computer proved difficult, and the rules for the; canonicalization were computationally; intractable. SMILES - Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry SystemThe best-known line notation today is SMILES. It was by Arthur and; David Weininger in response to a need for a simpler, more “human; accessible” notation than WLN. While SMILES is not trivial to learn; and write, most chemists can create correct SMILES with just a few; minutes training, and the entire SMILES language can be learned in; an hour or two. You can; read more details here.; Here are some examples:; C methane; CC ethane; C=C ethene; Oc1ccccc1 phenol. SMILES, like WLN, has a canonical form, but unlike WLN, Weininger; relied on the computer, rather than the chemist, to convert a; non-canonical SMILES to a canonical SMILES. This important; separation of duties was key to making SMILES easy to enter. (Read; more about canonicalization below.). InChIInChI is the latest and most modern of the line notations.

Atom and Bond Ids; All of the stereo handling code uses Ids to reference atoms and bonds, rather than indices. An Open Babel atom has an index (OBAtom::GetIdx()) and an Id (OBAtom::GetId()). The former runs from 1 to the number of atoms. The latter can be anything (don’t assume it’s the Idx-1), but is unique within the molecule. If you delete an atom, the indices change, but the Ids do not. For this reason, all stereo is stored using Ids so that stereo information is not invalidated by changes to the molecule. When the stereochemistry description involves implicit hydrogens or lone pairs, the special atom Id OBStereo::ImplicitRef (numerically, -2 or 4294967294 if accessed via the bindings) is used. The code above is quite verbose, and requires iteration through all of the stereo data.

If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:11744,hash,hash,11744,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['hash'],['hash']

This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to one of a number of allowed values.

The Open Babel API#; The API (Application Programming Interface) is the set of classes, methods and variables that a programming library provides to the user. The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API. Overall, our goal is for the Open Babel API to remain stable over as long a period as possible. This means that users can be confident that their code will continue to work despite the release of new versions with additi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CppAPI.html:1261,access,accessed,1261,docs/UseTheLibrary/CppAPI.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CppAPI.html,1,['access'],['accessed']

Security,"; FP3 SMARTS patterns specified in the file patterns.txt; FP4 SMARTS patterns specified in the file SMARTS_InteLigand.txt; MACCS SMARTS patterns specified in the file MACCS.txt. At present there are four types of fingerprints:. FP2, a path-based fingerprint which indexes small molecule fragments based on linear segments of up to 7 atoms (somewhat similar to the Daylight fingerprints):. A molecule structure is analysed to identify linear fragments of length from 1-7 atoms. Single atom fragments of C, N, and O are ignored. A fragment is terminated when the atoms form a ring.; For each of these fragments the atoms, bonding and whether they constitute a complete ring is recorded and saved in a set so that there is only one of each fragment type. Chemically identical versions, (i.e. ones with the atoms listed in reverse order and rings listed starting at different atoms) are identified and only a single canonical fragment is retained.; Each remaining fragment is assigned a hash number from 0 to 1020 which is used to set a bit in a 1024 bit vector. FP3 uses a series of SMARTS queries stored in patterns.txt; FP4 uses a series of SMARTS queries stored in SMARTS_InteLigand.txt; MACCS uses the SMARTS patterns in MACCS.txt. Note; Note that you can tailor the latter three fingerprints to your own needs by adding your own SMARTS queries to these files.

Security,"CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived then stereo perception is not performed. Any operations that require stereo information should call PerceiveStereo before accessing stereo information.; Behind the scenes, the code for stereo perception is quite different depending on the dimensionality (OBMol::GetDimension()) of the molecule.; 3D structures; Perhaps the most straightforward is when the structure has 3D coordinates. In this case, a symmetry analysis identifies stereogenic centers whose stereoconfigurations are then perceived from the coordinates. Some file formats such as the MOL file allow atoms and double bonds to be marked as have unspecified stereochemistry, and this information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; IC=CC[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:9293,access,accessing,9293,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['access'],['accessing']

Furthermore, the OBAtom API convenience functions for testing for particular elements (e.g. IsHydrogen()) have been removed.

User Guide; Handling of... Handling of aromaticity#; The purpose of this section is to give an overview of how Open Babel handles aromaticity. Given that atoms can be aromatic, bonds can be aromatic, and that molecules have a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions. If the flag is set, then IsAromatic() simply returns the corresponding value of the atom or bond flag.; If unset, then IsAromatic() triggers aromaticity perception (from scratch), and then returns the value of the flag. Perception of aromaticity#; It’s convenient to use the term “perception”, but what we mean is to apply an aromaticity model. Currently Open Babel only has a single aromaticity model, which is close to the Daylight aromaticity model. An aromaticity model describes how",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html:1452,access,access,1452,docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"ample, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”). Accessing stereochemistry information#; Each record of stereochemistry information around an atom or bond is stored as StereoData associated with the OBMol. First of all, let’s look at direct access to the StereoData. The following code counts the number of tetrahedral centers with specified stereochemistry, as well as the number of double bonds with specified cis/trans stereochemistry:; num_cistrans = 0; num_tetra = 0. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""F/C=C/C[C@@H](Cl)Br""); m = mol.OBMol. for genericdata in m.GetAllData(ob.StereoData):; stereodata = ob.toStereoBase(genericdata); stereotype = stereodata.GetType(). if stereotype == ob.OBStereo.CisTrans:; cistrans = ob.toCisTransStereo(stereodata); if cistrans.IsSpecified():; num_cistrans += 1. elif stereotype == ob.OBStereo.Tetrahedral:; tetra = ob.toTetrahedralStereo(stereodata); if tetra.IsSpecified():; num_tetra += 1.

End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes. The default filter level is set to obWarning, which means that users are told of critical errors, but not non-standard formatting of input files.; A global error handler :obapi:`obErrorLog` (an instance of :obapi:`OBMessageHandler`) is defined and should be used as shown in the API documentation for the :obapi:`OBMessageHandler` class. Lazy Evaluation#; The :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` calls are part of Open Babel’s lazy evaluation mechanism.; In some cases, code may desire to make a large number of changes to an OBMol object at once. Ideally, this should all happen without triggering unintended perception routines. Therefore, the BeginModify() call marks the beginning of such code, and EndModify() triggers any needed updates of lazy eval",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:8281,audit,auditing,8281,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['audit'],['auditing']

The; remaining attributes are as for the Get methods of; :obapi:`OBAtom`. Input/Output#; One of the strengths of Open Babel is the number of chemical file; formats that it can handle (see Supported File Formats and Options). Pybel provides a dictionary of the; input and output formats in the variables informats; and outformats; where the keys are the three-letter codes for each format (e.g.; pdb) and the values are the descriptions (e.g. Protein Data Bank; format).; Pybel greatly simplifies the process of reading and writing; molecules to and from strings or files. There are two functions for; reading Molecules:. readstring(); reads a Molecule from a string; readfile(); provides an iterator over the Molecules in a file. Here are some examples of their use. Note in particular the use of; next() to access the first (and possibly only) molecule in a; file:; >>> mymol = readstring(""smi"", ""CCCC""); >>> print(mymol.molwt); 58; >>> for mymol in readfile(""sdf"", ""largeSDfile.sdf""); ... print(mymol.molwt); >>> singlemol = next(readfile(""pdb"", ""1CRN.pdb"")). If a single molecule is to be written to a molecule or string, the; write(); method of the Molecule should be used:. mymol.write(format) returns a string; mymol.write(format, filename) writes the Molecule to a file.; An optional additional parameter, overwrite, should be set to; True if you wish to overwrite an existing file.

File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional informa",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:13081,hash,hashes,13081,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['hash'],['hashes']

For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified.

Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes. The default filter level is set to obWarning, which means that users are told of critical errors, but not non-standard formatting of input files.; A global error handler :obapi:`obErrorLog` (an instance of :obapi:`OBMessageHandler`) is defined and should be used as shown in the API documentation for the :obapi:`OBMessageHandler` class.

For this reason, a single OBStereoFacade should be created for a molecule and reused. The Config() object#; The description of the stereochemical configuration is accessed via a Config() object associated with each StereoData. The contents of this object will be different depending on the specific type of stereochemistry, e.g. OBCisTransStereo::Config (OBCisTransConfig from Python) records the begin and end Ids of the associated bond, the Ids of the attached atoms, the spatial relationship of those atoms, and whether stereo is specified.; Let’s read the SMILES string F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I and access the stereo.

As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list.

If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:12227,hash,hash,12227,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['hash'],['hash']

This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”). Accessing stereochemistry information#; Each record of stereochemistry information around an atom or bond is stored as StereoData associated with the OBMol. First of all, let’s look at direct access to the StereoData. The following code counts the number of tetrahedral centers with specified stereochemistry, as well as the number of double bonds with specified cis/trans stereochemistry:; num_cistrans = 0; num_tetra = 0. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""F/C=C/C[C@@H](Cl)Br""); m = mol.OBMol. for genericdata in m.GetAllData(ob.StereoData):; stereodata = ob.toStereoBase(genericdata); stereotype = stereodata.GetType(). if stereotype == ob.OBStereo.CisTrans:; cistrans = ob.toCisTransStereo(stereodata); if cistrans.IsSpecified():; num_cistrans += 1. elif stereotype == ob.OBStereo.Tetrahedral:; tetra = ob.toTetrahedralStereo(stereodata); if tetra.IsSpecified():; num_tetra += 1. Atom and Bond Ids; All of the stereo handling code uses Ids to reference atoms and bonds, rather than indices. An Open Babel atom has an index (OBAtom::GetIdx()) and an Id (OBAtom::GetId()). The former runs from 1 to the number of atoms. The latter can be anything (don’t assume it’s the Idx-1), but is uni",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:2074,access,access,2074,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"rs, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers).

Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters.

To make it simpler to access stereo data for a particular atom or bond, a facade class OBStereoFacade can instead be used, which provides convenience functions for these operations:; num_cistrans = 0; num_tetra = 0. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""F/C=C/C[C@@H](Cl)Br""); m = mol.OBMol. facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m). for atom in ob.OBMolAtomIter(m):; mid = atom.GetId(); if facade.HasTetrahedralStereo(mid):; tetra = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(mid); if tetra.IsSpecified():; num_tetra += 1. for bond in ob.OBMolBondIter(m):; mid = bond.GetId(); if facade.HasCisTransStereo(mid):; cistrans = facade.GetCisTransStereo(mid); if cistrans.IsSpecified():; num_cistrans += 1. Note that every time you create a new OBStereoFacade, a certain amount of work is done building up the correspondance between atoms/bonds and stereo data. For this reason, a single OBStereoFacade should be created for a molecule and reused.

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation.

Testability," (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of computation, it would pay to include it late in the boolean expression so that there is a chance it is skipped for some molecules.; Descriptors must have a conditional test and it is an error if they don",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:18827,test,test,18827,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['test'],['test']
Testability," API using Python#; The easiest place to add new tests is into test/testbindings.py. Classes are used to organise the tests, but for a single ‘miscellaneous’ test a good place is the TestSuite class. Somewhere in that class add the following function:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; my_molwt = round(pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The variable here is defined in testbindings.py and may be used find the path to testfiles. For example, given the test/ethanol.smi, the following may be used to read it:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; testfile = os.path.join(here, ""test"", ""ethanol.smi""); for mol, answer in zip(pybel.readfile(""smi"", testfile), answers):; my_molwt = round(mol.molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The tests use the standard unittest framework. One thing to note, which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($""). If you have multiple tests to add on a single ‘topic’, you will probably want to add your own class either into testbindings.py or a new Python file. Note that if you create a new Python file, it should start with the word test and you will need to add the rest of the name to the pybindtest list in test/CMakeLists.txt.

Testability," As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Testability," convenient for single molecules), the OBTestUtil struct provides GetFilename which will return the full path to the testfile, if you wish to open it yourself. Test using a command-line executable#; At the command-line we can calculate the molecular weight of ethanol as shown below. We are going to do something similar using the Python test framework:; > obabel -:CCO --append MW -otxt; 46.0684. Open test/testbabel.py in an editor. I have grouped tests related to the obabel executable into a class testOBabel, so let’s add a new test there. Somewhere in that class (for example, at the end), add a function such as the following (note: it must begin with the word “test”):; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; output, error = run_exec('obabel -:%s --append mw -otxt' % smi); my_molwt = round(float(output), 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). We provide a few convenience functions to help write these tests. The most important of these is run_exec(command) which runs the commandline executable returns a tuple of stdout and stderr. Behind the scenes, it adds the full path to the named executable. In the example above, run_exec(stdin, command) took a single argument; the next example will show its use with two arguments - the additional argument is a string which is treated as stdin, and piped through the executable.; In the previous example, each SMILES string was passed in one-at-a-time. However, it is more efficient to do them all in one go as in the following example:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); smifile = """"""CCO; [H]; [2H]; """"""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; output, error = run_exec(smifile, 'obabel -ismi --append mw -otxt'); for ans, my_ans in zip(answers, output.split(""\n"")):; self.assertEqual(ans, round(float(my_ans), 2)).

Testability," in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the test fails.

Testability," is made if both operands can be converted to numbers. This can be useful:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<129"". will convert the molecules with titles 56 123 and 126, which is probably what you wanted.; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<'129'"". converts only 123 and 126 because a string comparison is being made.; String comparisons can use * as a wildcard if used as the first or last character of the string (anywhere else a * is a normal character). So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’. SMARTS descriptor#; This descriptor will do a SMARTS test (substructure and more) on the molecules. The smarts ID can be abbreviated to s and the = is optional. More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"". This provides a more flexible alternative to the existing -s and -v options, since the SMARTS descriptor test can be combined with other tests. InChI descriptor#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'"". will convert only ethanol. It uses the default parameters for InChI comparison, so there may be some messages from the InChI code. There is quite a lot of flexibility on how the InChI is presented (you can miss out the non-essential bits):; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3"". all have the same effect.; The comparison of the InChI string is done only as far as the parameter’s length.

Testability," is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition, if you are converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of compu",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:18647,log,logP,18647,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['log'],['logP']

Enter MW into the box Sort by descriptor and click CONVERT. Finally, here’s how to filter based on molecular weight. Note that none of the preceding steps are necessary for the filter to work.

Testability," the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided. For example, you could instead ask for the anticlockwise arrangement of atoms looking towards the atom with Id 0:; configB = tetstereo.GetConfig(0, ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise, ob.OBStereo.ViewTowards); print(""Looking towards atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged anticlockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)). Which prints:; Looking towards atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged anticlockwise. To check whether two Configs represent the same stereo configuration, use the equality operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); confi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:7006,assert,assert,7006,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['assert'],['assert']

The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly.

Somewhere in that class add the following function:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; my_molwt = round(pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The variable here is defined in testbindings.py and may be used find the path to testfiles. For example, given the test/ethanol.smi, the following may be used to read it:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; testfile = os.path.join(here, ""test"", ""ethanol.smi""); for mol, answer in zip(pybel.readfile(""smi"", testfile), answers):; my_molwt = round(mol.molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt).

Testability," the options above can be used to filter molecules:. -s - convert molecules that match a SMARTS string; -v - convert molecules that don’t match a SMARTS string; -f and -l - convert molecules in a certain range; --unique - only convert unique molecules (that is, remove duplicates); --filter - convert molecules that meet specified chemical (and other) criteria. This section focuses on the --filter option, which is very versatile and can select a subset of molecules based either on properties imported with the molecule (as from a SDF file) or from calculations made by Open Babel on the molecule.; The aim has been to make the option flexible and intuitive to use; don’t be put off by the long description.; You use it like this:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""MW<130 ROTATABLE_BOND > 2"". It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight. You can see a list of available descriptors using:; obabel -L descriptors. or from a menu item in the GUI. Faster filtering; Open Babel provides a number of utility file formats (see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:16469,test,tests,16469,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability," the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest).

Testability,"""title>='D'"". converts molecules with titles Dimethyl Ether and Ethanol in the example file.; It is not always necessary to use the single quotes when the meaning is unambiguous: the two examples above work without them. But a numerical, rather than a string, comparison is made if both operands can be converted to numbers. This can be useful:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<129"". will convert the molecules with titles 56 123 and 126, which is probably what you wanted.; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<'129'"". converts only 123 and 126 because a string comparison is being made.; String comparisons can use * as a wildcard if used as the first or last character of the string (anywhere else a * is a normal character). So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’.

More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"".

Testability,", which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($""). If you have multiple tests to add on a single ‘topic’, you will probably want to add your own class either into testbindings.py or a new Python file. Note that if you create a new Python file, it should start with the word test and you will need to add the rest of the name to the pybindtest list in test/CMakeLists.txt. Some final comments#; Some thoughts on the topic of the perfect test:. When adding a regression test for a bug fix, the test should fail without the fix, but pass afterwards.; When adding a test for a new feature, the test should provide complete coverage for all code paths.; Test not just perfect input, but all sorts of dodgy input like molecules with no atoms, empty strings, and so forth.; Don’t be afraid to add tests for things which you already (think you) know will pass; such tests may surprise you, and even if they don’t they will prevent regressions. Potential problems/gotchas:. Why isn’t your Python test being run? Test functions name must begin with the word test.; If your new test passes first time, check that it is actually running correctly, by changing your asserts so that they should fail.; The C++ tests will be marked as failing if the test writes any of the following to stdout: ERROR, FAIL, Test failed. This is actually how the assert methods work.; It’s best to avoid writing to disk, and instead write to a variable or stdout and capture it (as in the examples above). previous; Documentation. next; Software Archaeology.

The default; options are to show the image on the screen (show=True), not to; write to a file (filename=None), to calculate 2D coordinates; (usecoords=False) but not to store them (update=False).; The addh(); and removeh(); methods allow hydrogens to be added and removed.; If a molecule does not have 3D coordinates, they can be generated; using the make3D(); method. By default, this includes 50 steps of a geometry; optimisation using the MMFF94 forcefield. The list of available; forcefields is stored in the; forcefields; variable. To further optimise the structure, you can use the; localopt(); method, which by default carries out 500 steps of an optimisation; using MMFF94.

Whenever editing a file, please keep these in mind. Documentation and Code Readability#. Add clear documentation for every public function (see Documentation).; Add clear comments on the internal operation of functions so that anyone can read through the code quickly. If you’re not sure what a function does, e-mail the openbabel-devel list and it can be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally. Many methods are not particularly useful except inside the library itself.; Improve code indentation. It seems like a minor point, but the format of your code is important. As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation sty",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html:1181,test,tested,1181,docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,1,['test'],['tested']

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening.

Every record contains the tags PUBCHEM_CACTVS_HBOND_DONOR, PUBCHEM_CACTVS_HBOND_ACCEPTOR and PUBCHEM_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT, and most of the records contain the tag PUBCHEM_XLOGP3.; The program must create a new SD file which is the same as the input file but with a new tag data field named “RULE5”. This must be “1” if the record passes Lipinski’s rule, “0” if it does not, and “no logP” if the PUBCHEM_XLOGP3 field is missing. This exercise is a bit of a stretch for the Open Babel command-line.

Testability,"; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test.

Testability,"Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code.

AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of computation, it would pay to include it late in the boolean expression so that there is a chance it is skipped for some molecules.; Descriptors must have a conditional test and it is an error if they don’t. The default test, as used by MW or logP, is a numerical one, but the parsing of the text, and what the test does is defined in each descriptor’s code (a virtual function in the OBDescriptor class).

With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided. For example, you could instead ask for the anticlockwise arrangement of atoms looking towards the atom with Id 0:; configB = tetstereo.GetConfig(0, ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise, ob.OBStereo.ViewTowards); print(""Looking towards atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged anticlockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)).

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening.

Testability,"converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130.

For example, many quantum mechanics formats (as well as other formats which do not recognize bonds) offer the following options:; -as Call only :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` (single bonds only); -ab No bond perception. Make sure to use generic data classes like :obapi:`OBUnitCell` and others as appropriate. If your format stores any sort of common data types, consider adding a subclass of :obapi:`OBGenericData` for use by other formats and user code.; Please make sure to add several example files to the test set repository. Ideally, these should work several areas of your import code – in the end, the more robust the test set, the more stable and useful Open Babel will be. The test files should include at least one example of a correct file and one example of an invalid file (i.e., something which will properly be ignored and not crash babel).; Make sure to document your format using the string returned by Description(). At the minimum this should include a description of all options, along with examples.

But a numerical, rather than a string, comparison is made if both operands can be converted to numbers. This can be useful:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<129"". will convert the molecules with titles 56 123 and 126, which is probably what you wanted.; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<'129'"". converts only 123 and 126 because a string comparison is being made.; String comparisons can use * as a wildcard if used as the first or last character of the string (anywhere else a * is a normal character). So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’.

More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"".

Testability,"hat bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the test fails.

Testability,"he documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a new test). Modifying Old Code#; When modifying old code, please take a little time to improve the documentation of the function.; Even an “obvious” function must be documented, if for no other reason than to say, “This function does what you think, and has no side effects.”; Take :obapi:`OBAtom::SetAtomicNum() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::SetAtomicNum>` - should be “obvious”, right? Wrong. Does it affect the charge?; The spin multiplicity?; The implicit valence?; The hybridization?; What happens if I do SetHybridization(3) and then SetAtomicNum(1)?; Does the molecule have to be in the modify state?; If the molecule is not in the modify state, is it put into the modify state by SetAtomicNum()?; Does SetAtomicNum() cause a recomputation of aromaticity?. User documentation and tutorials#; There’s no point spending time adding new features to Open Babel unless you describe how to use them and give examples. The best place to do this is in the user documentation…which you’re reading right now.; This documentation is automatically generated from text files in a simple markup language (reStructuredText) using the Sphinx documentation system.

The variable here is defined in testbindings.py and may be used find the path to testfiles. For example, given the test/ethanol.smi, the following may be used to read it:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; testfile = os.path.join(here, ""test"", ""ethanol.smi""); for mol, answer in zip(pybel.readfile(""smi"", testfile), answers):; my_molwt = round(mol.molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The tests use the standard unittest framework. One thing to note, which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($"").

Testability,"he molecules with titles 56 123 and 126, which is probably what you wanted.; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<'129'"". converts only 123 and 126 because a string comparison is being made.; String comparisons can use * as a wildcard if used as the first or last character of the string (anywhere else a * is a normal character). So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’. SMARTS descriptor#; This descriptor will do a SMARTS test (substructure and more) on the molecules. The smarts ID can be abbreviated to s and the = is optional. More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"". This provides a more flexible alternative to the existing -s and -v options, since the SMARTS descriptor test can be combined with other tests. InChI descriptor#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'"". will convert only ethanol. It uses the default parameters for InChI comparison, so there may be some messages from the InChI code. There is quite a lot of flexibility on how the InChI is presented (you can miss out the non-essential bits):; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3"". all have the same effect.; The comparison of the InChI string is done only as far as the parameter’s length.

This feature can be useful because it lets you know (based on the output) how many and which OB_ASSERT statements failed.; OB_COMPARE(expA, expB) - Expressions A and B must be equal or else the test fails (but does not terminate). It is often useful to write a test that uses a checked-in testfile. Let’s do this for our example testcase. If you place a file ethanol.smi into test/files, then the following will read it using a convenience function provided by obtest.h.:; void test_Ethanol_MolWt(); {; OBMolPtr mol = OBTestUtil::ReadFile(""ethanol.smi""); double molwt = mol.GetMolWt();; OB_ASSERT(molwt - 46.07 < 0.01);; }.

Substructure and similarity searching#; For information on using obabel for substructure searching and similarity searching, see Molecular fingerprints and similarity searching. Sorting molecules#; The --sort option is used to output molecules ordered by the value of a descriptor:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.xxx --sort desc. If the descriptor desc provides a numerical value, the molecule with the smallest value is output first. For descriptors that provide a string output the order is alphabetical, but for the InChI descriptor a more chemically informed order is used (e.g. “CH4” is before than “C2H6”, “CH4” is less than “ClH” hydrogen chloride).; The order can be reversed by preceding the descriptor name with ~, e.g.:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --sort ~logP. As a shortcut, the value of the descriptor can be appended to the molecule name by adding a + to the descriptor, e.g.:; obabel aromatics.smi -osmi --sort ~MW+; c1ccccc1C=C styrene 104.149; c1ccccc1C toluene 92.1384; c1ccccc1 benzene 78.1118. Remove duplicate molecules#; The --unique option is used to remove, i.e. not output, any chemically identical molecules during conversion:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique [param]. The optional parameter param defines what is regarded as “chemically identical”. It can be the name of any descriptor, although not many are likely to be useful. If param is omitted, the InChI descriptor is used. Other useful descriptors are ‘cansmi’ and ‘cansmiNS’ (canonical SMILES, with and without stereochemical information),’title’ and truncated InChI (see below).; A message is output for each duplicate found:; Removed methyl benzene - a duplicate of toluene (#1).

Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization. The available forcefields as listed as follows:; C:\>obabel -L forcefields; GAFF General Amber Force Field (GAFF).; Ghemical Ghemical force field.; MMFF94 MMFF94 force field.; MMFF94s MMFF94s force field.; UFF Universal Force Field. To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:27969,log,log,27969,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,2,['log'],['log']

The tests use the standard unittest framework. One thing to note, which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($""). If you have multiple tests to add on a single ‘topic’, you will probably want to add your own class either into testbindings.py or a new Python file. Note that if you create a new Python file, it should start with the word test and you will need to add the rest of the name to the pybindtest list in test/CMakeLists.txt. Some final comments#; Some thoughts on the topic of the perfect test:. When adding a regression test for a bug fix, the test should fail without the fix, but pass afterwards.; When adding a test for a new feature, the test should provide complete coverage for all code paths.; Test not just perfect input, but all sorts of dodgy input like molecules with no atoms, empty strings, and so forth.; Don’t be afraid to add tests for things which you already (think you) know will pass; such tests may surprise you, and even if they don’t they will prevent regressions. Potential problems/gotchas:. Why isn’t your Python test being run?

There are a couple of points to note about the pattern file:. Although a SMARTS string may match a substructure of a molecule, the descriptor contribution is only assigned to the first atom of the match.; Where several SMARTS strings assign values to the same atom, only the final assignment is retained. As an example, the following set of patterns will assign a contribution of 0.4 to all atoms except for carbon atoms, which have a value of 1.0:; ;heavy; [*] 0.4 # All atoms; [#6] 1.0 # All carbon atoms. If you wish to take into account contributions from hydrogen atoms, you should precede the ;heavy section by a ;hydrogen section. The values for the contributions in the latter section are multiplied by the number of hydrogens attached to the matching atom. For example, consider the following set of patterns:; ;hydrogen; [*] 0.2 # Hydrogens attached to all atoms; C 1.0 # Hydrogens attached to an aliphatic carbon; ;heavy; C 10.0 # An aliphatic carbon. For ethanol, this gives a value of 25.2: two carbons (20.0), five hydrogens attached to a carbon (5.0), and one other hydrogen (0.2).

I have grouped tests related to the obabel executable into a class testOBabel, so let’s add a new test there. Somewhere in that class (for example, at the end), add a function such as the following (note: it must begin with the word “test”):; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; output, error = run_exec('obabel -:%s --append mw -otxt' % smi); my_molwt = round(float(output), 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). We provide a few convenience functions to help write these tests. The most important of these is run_exec(command) which runs the commandline executable returns a tuple of stdout and stderr. Behind the scenes, it adds the full path to the named executable. In the example above, run_exec(stdin, command) took a single argument; the next example will show its use with two arguments - the additional argument is a string which is treated as stdin, and piped through the executable.; In the previous example, each SMILES string was passed in one-at-a-time.

Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening.

A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($""). If you have multiple tests to add on a single ‘topic’, you will probably want to add your own class either into testbindings.py or a new Python file. Note that if you create a new Python file, it should start with the word test and you will need to add the rest of the name to the pybindtest list in test/CMakeLists.txt. Some final comments#; Some thoughts on the topic of the perfect test:. When adding a regression test for a bug fix, the test should fail without the fix, but pass afterwards.; When adding a test for a new feature, the test should provide complete coverage for all code paths.; Test not just perfect input, but all sorts of dodgy input like molecules with no atoms, empty strings, and so forth.; Don’t be afraid to add tests for things which you already (think you) know will pass; such tests may surprise you, and even if they don’t they will prevent regressions. Potential problems/gotchas:. Why isn’t your Python test being run? Test functions name must begin with the word test.; If your new test passes first time, check that it is actually running correctly, by changing your asserts so that they should fail.; The C++ tests will be marked as failing if the test writes any of the following to stdout: ERROR, FAIL, Test failed. This is actually how the assert methods work.; It’s best to avoid writing to disk, and instead write to a variable or stdout and capture it (as in the examples above). previous; Documentation. next; Software Archaeology.

It is often useful to write a test that uses a checked-in testfile. Let’s do this for our example testcase. If you place a file ethanol.smi into test/files, then the following will read it using a convenience function provided by obtest.h.:; void test_Ethanol_MolWt(); {; OBMolPtr mol = OBTestUtil::ReadFile(""ethanol.smi""); double molwt = mol.GetMolWt();; OB_ASSERT(molwt - 46.07 < 0.01);; }.

We are going to do something similar using the Python test framework:; > obabel -:CCO --append MW -otxt; 46.0684. Open test/testbabel.py in an editor. I have grouped tests related to the obabel executable into a class testOBabel, so let’s add a new test there. Somewhere in that class (for example, at the end), add a function such as the following (note: it must begin with the word “test”):; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; output, error = run_exec('obabel -:%s --append mw -otxt' % smi); my_molwt = round(float(output), 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt).

To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the test fails.

Testability,"nd that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests.

While more verbose, the new arrangement is in line with standard practice and helps avoid conflict with a different Python project, PyBEL.

Furthermore, the OBAtom API convenience functions for testing for particular elements (e.g. IsHydrogen()) have been removed. Instead, OBAtom::GetAtomicNum() should be used along with an element constant or atomic number:; // OB 2.x; if (atom->IsCarbon()) {... // OB 3.0; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == OBElements.Carbon) {...; // or; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == 6) {...

So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of computation, it would pay to include it late in the boolean expression so that there is a chance it is skipped for some molecules.; Descriptors must have a conditional test and it is an error if they don’t. The default test, as used by MW or logP, is a numerical one, but the parsing of the text, and what the test does is defined in each descriptor’s code (a virtual function in the OBDescriptor class). Three examples of this are described in the following sections. String descriptors#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title='Ethanol'"".

Testability,"orted as converted matches N. Test the API using Python#; The easiest place to add new tests is into test/testbindings.py. Classes are used to organise the tests, but for a single ‘miscellaneous’ test a good place is the TestSuite class. Somewhere in that class add the following function:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; my_molwt = round(pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The variable here is defined in testbindings.py and may be used find the path to testfiles. For example, given the test/ethanol.smi, the following may be used to read it:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; testfile = os.path.join(here, ""test"", ""ethanol.smi""); for mol, answer in zip(pybel.readfile(""smi"", testfile), answers):; my_molwt = round(mol.molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The tests use the standard unittest framework. One thing to note, which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($""). If you have multiple tests to add on a single ‘topic’, you will probably want to add your own class either into testbindings.py or a new Python file. Note that if you create a new Python file, it should start with the word test and you will need to add the rest of the name to the pybindtest list in test/CMakeLists.txt. Some final comments#; Some thoughts on the topic of the perfect test:.

Testability,"others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the test fails.

There are a couple of points to note about the pattern file:. Although a SMARTS string may match a substructure of a molecule, the descriptor contribution is only assigned to the first atom of the match.; Where several SMARTS strings assign values to the same atom, only the final assignment is retained. As an example, the following set of patterns will assign a contribution of 0.4 to all atoms except for carbon atoms, which have a value of 1.0:; ;heavy; [*] 0.4 # All atoms; [#6] 1.0 # All carbon atoms. If you wish to take into account contributions from hydrogen atoms, you should precede the ;heavy section by a ;hydrogen section. The values for the contributions in the latter section are multiplied by the number of hydrogens attached to the matching atom. For example, consider the following set of patterns:; ;hydrogen; [*] 0.2 # Hydrogens attached to all atoms; C 1.0 # Hydrogens attached ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html:3302,test,test,3302,docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"pB) - Expressions A and B must be equal or else the test fails (but does not terminate). It is often useful to write a test that uses a checked-in testfile. Let’s do this for our example testcase. If you place a file ethanol.smi into test/files, then the following will read it using a convenience function provided by obtest.h.:; void test_Ethanol_MolWt(); {; OBMolPtr mol = OBTestUtil::ReadFile(""ethanol.smi""); double molwt = mol.GetMolWt();; OB_ASSERT(molwt - 46.07 < 0.01);; }. As well as ReadFile (which is convenient for single molecules), the OBTestUtil struct provides GetFilename which will return the full path to the testfile, if you wish to open it yourself. Test using a command-line executable#; At the command-line we can calculate the molecular weight of ethanol as shown below. We are going to do something similar using the Python test framework:; > obabel -:CCO --append MW -otxt; 46.0684. Open test/testbabel.py in an editor. I have grouped tests related to the obabel executable into a class testOBabel, so let’s add a new test there. Somewhere in that class (for example, at the end), add a function such as the following (note: it must begin with the word “test”):; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; output, error = run_exec('obabel -:%s --append mw -otxt' % smi); my_molwt = round(float(output), 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). We provide a few convenience functions to help write these tests. The most important of these is run_exec(command) which runs the commandline executable returns a tuple of stdout and stderr. Behind the scenes, it adds the full path to the named executable. In the example above, run_exec(stdin, command) took a single argument; the next example will show its use with two arguments - the additional argument is a string which is treated as stdin, and piped through the exec",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:5905,test,tests,5905,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,3,['test'],"['test', 'testOBabel', 'tests']"

So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of computation, it would pay to include it late in the boolean expression so that there is a chance it is skipped for some molecules.; Descriptors must have a conditional test and it is an error if they don’t. The default test, as used by MW or logP, is a numerical one, but the parsing of the text, and what the test does is defined in each descriptor’s code (a virtual function in the OBDescriptor class). Three examples of this are described in the following sections. String descriptors#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title='Ethanol'"". The descriptor title, when followed by a string (here enclosed by single quotes), does a case-sensitive string comparison. (‘ethanol’ wouldn’t match anything in the example file.) The comparison does not have to be just equality:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title>='D'"". converts molecules with titles Dimethyl Ether and Ethanol in the example file.; It is not always necessary to use the single quotes when the meaning is unambiguous: the two examples above work without them.

Testability,"s, remove duplicates); --filter - convert molecules that meet specified chemical (and other) criteria. This section focuses on the --filter option, which is very versatile and can select a subset of molecules based either on properties imported with the molecule (as from a SDF file) or from calculations made by Open Babel on the molecule.; The aim has been to make the option flexible and intuitive to use; don’t be put off by the long description.; You use it like this:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""MW<130 ROTATABLE_BOND > 2"". It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight. You can see a list of available descriptors using:; obabel -L descriptors. or from a menu item in the GUI. Faster filtering; Open Babel provides a number of utility file formats (see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see Copy raw text (copy)). This copies the content of the molecular file directly from input to output. If you are not converting the molecules between different formats, this procedure is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:16723,test,tests,16723,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see Copy raw text (copy)). This copies the content of the molecular file directly from input to output. If you are not converting the molecules between different formats, this procedure is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition, if you are converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate.

Potential problems/gotchas:. Why isn’t your Python test being run? Test functions name must begin with the word test.; If your new test passes first time, check that it is actually running correctly, by changing your asserts so that they should fail.; The C++ tests will be marked as failing if the test writes any of the following to stdout: ERROR, FAIL, Test failed.

The various assert methods are listed in obtest.h and are as follows:. OB_REQUIRE(exp) - This must evaluate to true or else the test will be marked as failing and will terminate. This is useful for conditions that must be true or else the remaining tests cannot be run (e.g. was the necessary OBFormat found?).; OB_ASSERT(exp) - This must evaluate to true or else the test will be marked as failing. In contrast to OB_REQUIRE, the test does not terminate in this case, but continues to run. This feature can be useful because it lets you know (based on the output) how many and which OB_ASSERT statements failed.; OB_COMPARE(expA, expB) - Expressions A and B must be equal or else the test fails (but does not terminate).

Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’. Properties can contain spaces, but then when writing the name in the filter parameter, you need to replace them with underscores. So in the example above, the test would also be suitable for a property ‘ROTATABLE BOND’.; Open Babel uses a SDF-like property (internally this is stored in the class OBPairData) in preference to a descriptor if one exists in the molecule. So with the example file, which can be found here:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""logP>5"". converts only a molecule with a property logP=10.900, since the others do not have this property and logP, being also a descriptor, is calculated and is always much less than 5.; If a property does not have a conditional test, then it returns true only if it exists. So:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""ROTATABLE_BOND MW<130"". converts only those molecules with a ROTATABLE_BOND property and a molecular weight less than 130. If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property.

The various assert methods are listed in obtest.h and are as follows:. OB_REQUIRE(exp) - This must evaluate to true or else the test will be marked as failing and will terminate. This is useful for conditions that must be true or else the remaining tests cannot be run (e.g. was the necessary OBFormat found?).; OB_ASSERT(exp) - This must evaluate to true or else the test will be marked as failing. In contrast to OB_REQUIRE, the test does not terminate in this case, but continues to run. This feature can be useful because it lets you know (based on the output) how many and which OB_ASSERT statements failed.; OB_COMPARE(expA, expB) - Expressions A and B must be equal or else the test fails (but does not terminate). It is often useful to write a test that uses a checked-in testfile. Let’s do this for our example testcase. If you place a file ethanol.smi into test/files, then the following will read it using a convenience function provided by obtest.h.:; void test_Ethanol_MolWt(); {; OBMolPtr mol = OBTestUtil::ReadFile(""ethanol.smi""); double molwt = mol.GetMolWt();; OB_ASSERT(molwt - 46.07 < 0.01);; }.

This section describes some general guidelines and “best practices” for code developers. Developer Resources#; For new and existing developers here are some useful resources:. GitHub project page; Development version API documentation; Development version Sphinx documentation. Working with the Development Code#; To download and update the latest version of the Open Babel source code, you need Git. Git is the name of the project used to maintain the Open Babel version control repository. There are many clients for Git, including command-line and GUI applications. Keeping up to date with Git#. Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel.

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html:780,test,test,780,docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,1,['test'],['test']

Whenever editing a file, please keep these in mind. Documentation and Code Readability#. Add clear documentation for every public function (see Documentation).; Add clear comments on the internal operation of functions so that anyone can read through the code quickly. If you’re not sure what a function does, e-mail the openbabel-devel list and it can be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally.

Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel. Configure and compile this using CMake (see Compiling Open Babel).; After some time passes, and you want the latest bug fixes or new features, you may want to update your source code.

They keep thinking of new file formats.; Indeed, these are not just simple differences in how chemical; data is stored, but often completely different views on molecular; representations. For example, some file formats ignore hydrogen atoms; as “implicit,” while others do not store bonding information. This is,; in fact, a key reason for Open Babel’s existence.; OpenBabel has support for 146 formats in total. It can read 108 formats and can write 107 formats. These formats are identified by a name (for example, ShelX format) and one or more short codes (in this case, ins or res). The titles of each section provide this information (for example, ShelX format (ins, res)).; The short code is used when using obabel or babel to convert files from one format to another:; obabel -iins myfile.ins -ocml. converts from ShelX format to Chemical Markup Language (in this case, no output file is specified and the output will be written to screen [stdout]). In fact, if the filename extension is the same as the file format code, then there is no need to specify the code.

General#; What is Open Babel?; Put simply, Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and many related areas.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version of Babel. But if you like one",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:1000,simpl,simply,1000,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability," be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified. Click CONVERT. We can going to use the following structure for substructure and similarity searching. It can be represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc(N)cc1. How the search works; Behind the scenes, the FastSearch index simply stores a path-based; binary fingerprint for each molecule. When used to search, similarity; is measured based on the Tanimoto coefficient. For exact search, hits; are verified by Open Babel’s graph isomorphism matcher. Next, we will create a FastSearch index for this dataset of 1000 molecules:. Convert 1000_chembl.sdf from SDF to FS format, with an output filename of 1000_chembl.fs. By using this FastSearch index, the speed of substructure and similarity searching is much improved. First of all, let’s do a substructure search:. Set up a conversion from FS to SMILES with 1000_chembl.fs as the input file. Tick the box for Output below only and Display in Firefox; Enter Nc1ccc(N)cc1 into the box Convert only if match SMARTS or mol in file; Click CONVERT.

As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolki",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:10908,clear,clear,10908,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability," new descriptor. Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel. Remember that if you do add a new plugin, please contribute the code back to the Open Babel project. How to add a new file format; Adding new operations and options; The OBOp class.

Usability," quickly required adding the; concept of a non-integral “aromatic” distributed bond, to the; single/double/triple bonds of the simple valence model. And that; was just the start - tautomers, ferrocenes, charged molecules and a; host of other common molecules simply don’t fit the valence model; well.; This complicates life for the computer scientist. As we shall see,; they are the source of most of the complexity of modern; cheminformatics systems. Older systems: Connection Tables#; Most of the early (and some modern) representations of molecules; were in a connection table, literally, a table enumerating the; atoms, and a table enumerating the bonds and which atoms each bond; connected. Here is an example of connection-table (CTAB) portion of; an MDL “SD” file (the data portion is not shown here):; MOLCONV. 3 2 0 0 1 0 1 V2000; 5.9800 -0.0000 -0.0000 Br 0 0 0 0 0 0; 4.4000 -0.6600 0.8300 C 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3.5400 -1.3500 -0.1900 C 0 0 0 0 0 0; 1 2 1 0; 2 3 1 0.

MDL provides; extensive documentation; for their various CTFile formats if you are interested in the; details.; Connection tables can capture the valence model of chemistry fairly; well, but they suffer from three problems:; 1. They are very inefficient, taking on the order of a dozen or two of; bytes of data per atom and per bond. Newer line notations; (discussed below) represent a molecules with an average of 1.2 to; 1.5 bytes per atom, or 6-8 bytes per atom if coordinates are added.; 2. Many suffered from lack of specificity. For example, since; hydrogens are often not specified, there can be ambiguity as to the; electronic state of some molecules, because the connection-table; format does not explicitly state the valence assumptions.; 3.

User Guide; obabel vs... obabel vs Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta#; The Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta is the brainchild of Andrew Dalke. It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used. Also the copy output format at present works only for files with Unix line endings. Heavy atom counts from an SD file#. For each record from the benzodiazepine file, print the total number of heavy atoms in each record (that is, exclude hydrogens).

Usability," you know that the whole molecule is on one; line of a file, it’s easy to parse.; Line notations are also very nice for database applications.; Relational databases have datatypes that, roughly speaking, are; divided into numbers, text, and “everything else”, also known as; “BLOBs” (Binary Large OBjects). You can store line notations in the; “text” fields much more easily than connection tables.; Line notations also have pragmatic advantages. Modern Unix-like; systems (such as UNIX, Linux and Cygwin) have a number of very; powerful “filter” text-processing programs that can be “piped”; together (connected end-to-end) to perform important tasks. For; example, to count the number of molecules containing aliphatic; nitrogen in a SMILES file, I can simply:; grep N file.smi | wc. (grep looks for a particular expression, in this case N, and; prints any line that contains it, and wc (“word count”) counts the; number of words and lines.); This is just a simple example of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds.

Usability,", ""with_desc.sdf""); output.write(mol); output.close(). For convenience, a Molecule provides an iterator over its Atoms.; This is used as follows:; for atom in myMolecule:; # do something with atom. Atoms have the following attributes: atomicmass, atomicnum,; coords, exactmass, formalcharge, heavyvalence,; heterovalence, hyb, idx, implicitvalence, isotope,; partialcharge, spin, type, valence, vector. The .coords; attribute provides a tuple (x, y, z) of the atom’s coordinates. The; remaining attributes are as for the Get methods of; :obapi:`OBAtom`. Input/Output#; One of the strengths of Open Babel is the number of chemical file; formats that it can handle (see Supported File Formats and Options). Pybel provides a dictionary of the; input and output formats in the variables informats; and outformats; where the keys are the three-letter codes for each format (e.g.; pdb) and the values are the descriptions (e.g. Protein Data Bank; format).; Pybel greatly simplifies the process of reading and writing; molecules to and from strings or files. There are two functions for; reading Molecules:. readstring(); reads a Molecule from a string; readfile(); provides an iterator over the Molecules in a file. Here are some examples of their use. Note in particular the use of; next() to access the first (and possibly only) molecule in a; file:; >>> mymol = readstring(""smi"", ""CCCC""); >>> print(mymol.molwt); 58; >>> for mymol in readfile(""sdf"", ""largeSDfile.sdf""); ... print(mymol.molwt); >>> singlemol = next(readfile(""pdb"", ""1CRN.pdb"")). If a single molecule is to be written to a molecule or string, the; write(); method of the Molecule should be used:. mymol.write(format) returns a string; mymol.write(format, filename) writes the Molecule to a file.; An optional additional parameter, overwrite, should be set to; True if you wish to overwrite an existing file.

So to read the 2D coordinates (rather than the 3D) from a CML file and generate an SVG file displaying the molecule on a black background, the relevant options are used as follows:; obabel mymol.cml out.svg -a2 -xb. Append property values to the title#; The command line option --append adds extra information to the title of the molecule.; The information can be calculated from the structure of the molecule or can originate from a property attached to the molecule (in the case of CML and SDF input files). It is used as follows:; obabel infile.sdf -osmi --append ""MW CAT_NO"". MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates the molecular weight of the molecule, and CAT_NO is a property of the molecule from the SDF input file. The values of these are added to the title of the molecule. For input files with many molecules these additions are specific to each molecule. (Note that the related option --addtotitle simply adds the same text to every title.); The append option only takes one parameter, which means that it may be necessary to enclose all of the descriptor IDs or property names together in a single set of quotes.; If the name of the property in the SDF file (internally the Attribute in OBPairData) contains spaces, these spaces should be replaced by underscore characters, ‘_’. So the example above would also work for a property named CAT NO.; By default, the extra items are added to the title separated by spaces. But if the first character in the parameter is a punctuation character other than ‘_’, it is used as the separator instead. If the list starts with “t”, a tab character is used as a separator.

Others use only atoms and electrons.; Some programs use symmetric representations. Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others. It gains by way of its users, contributors, developers, related projects, and the general chemical community. We must continually strive to support these constituencies.; We gratefully accept contributions in many forms – from bug reports, complaints, and critiques, which help us improve what we do poorly, to feature suggestions, code contributions, and other efforts, which direct our future development. For end users, we seek to provide a range of utility, from simple (or complex) file interconversion, to indexing, databasing, and transforming chemical and molecular data.; For developers, we seek to provide an easy-to-use free and open source chemical library. This assists a variety of chemical software, from molecular viewers and visualization tools and editors to databases, property prediction tools, and in-house development. To this end, we hope that our tools reflect several key points:. As much chemical information and files should be read and understood by Open Babel. This means that we should always strive to support as many concepts as possible in a given file format, and support for additional file formats is beneficial to the community as a whole.; Releases should be made to be “as good as we can make it” each and every time.; Improving our code and our community to bring in additional contributions in many forms helps both developers and end-users alike.

Usability,"Line Notation versus Connection Tables: A practical matter#; Why are line notations preferred over connection-table formats? In; theory, either could express the same information. But there are; practical difference, mostly related to the complexity of “parsing”; a connection table. If you know that the whole molecule is on one; line of a file, it’s easy to parse.; Line notations are also very nice for database applications.; Relational databases have datatypes that, roughly speaking, are; divided into numbers, text, and “everything else”, also known as; “BLOBs” (Binary Large OBjects). You can store line notations in the; “text” fields much more easily than connection tables.; Line notations also have pragmatic advantages. Modern Unix-like; systems (such as UNIX, Linux and Cygwin) have a number of very; powerful “filter” text-processing programs that can be “piped”; together (connected end-to-end) to perform important tasks. For; example, to count the number of molecules containing aliphatic; nitrogen in a SMILES file, I can simply:; grep N file.smi | wc. (grep looks for a particular expression, in this case N, and; prints any line that contains it, and wc (“word count”) counts the; number of words and lines.); This is just a simple example of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue).

Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:. Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer.

User Guide; obabel vs... obabel vs Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta#; The Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta is the brainchild of Andrew Dalke. It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used. Also the copy output format at present works only for files with Unix line endings. Heavy atom counts from an SD file#. For each record from the benzodiazepine file, print the total number of heavy atoms in each record (that is, exclude hydrogens). The output is one output line per record, containing the count as an integer. If at all possible, show how to read directly from the gzip’ed input SD file. obabel benzodiazepine.sdf.gz -otxt --title """" --append atoms -d -l5. The txt format outputs only the title but we set that to nothing and then append the result. The atoms descriptor counts the number of atoms after the -d option has removed the hydrogens.

Usability,"ading/writing and the handling of aromaticity.; Writing SMILES; Unless Kekulé SMILES are requested (via the k output option), the SMILES writer will always write an aromatic SMILES string. IsAromatic() will be called on atoms and bonds to determine whether to use lowercase letters. As described earlier, this will trigger aromaticity perception according to the default model if the molecules is not marked as having its aromaticity perceived.; Reading SMILES; The situation when reading SMILES is a bit more involved. If the SMILES string contains lowercase characters and aromatic bonds, this information is used to mark atoms and bonds as aromatic. The molecule is then kekulized to assign bond orders to aromatic bonds. Next, unless the a option is supplied, the molecule is marked as having its aromaticity unperceived.; That last step might seem strange. Why, after going to the trouble of reading the aromaticity and using it to kekulize, do we then effectively ignore it?; The reason is simply this: when writing an aromatic SMILES, we usually want to use our own aromaticity model and not that present in the input SMILES string. Otherwise, SMILES strings for the same molecule from different sources (that may use different aromaticity models) would not yield the same canonical SMILES string.; Of course, if the SMILES string came from Open Babel in the first place, we are doing unnecessary work when we keep reapplying the same aromaticity model. In this case, you can speed things up by using the a option, so that the aromaticity information present in the input is retained. The following examples show this in action:; $ obabel -:cc -osmi; C=C; $ obabel -:cc -osmi -aa; cc. Effect of modifying the structure#; Perhaps surprisingly, modifying the structure has no effect on the existing aromaticity flags; deleting an atom does not mark aromaticity as unperceived, nor indeed does any other change to the structure such as changing the atomic number of an atom or setting its charge;",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html:4475,simpl,simply,4475,docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,1,['simpl'],['simply']

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title).

The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-bonded pairs (default = 10).

Software Archaeology#; In any large software project, some parts of the code are revised and kept up-to-date more than others.; Conversely, some parts of the code begin to fall behind – the code may be poorly tested, poorly documented, and not always up to best practices.; With that in mind, the following sections describe the important task of software archeology – diving in to older parts of code and bringing them up to date. Whenever editing a file, please keep these in mind. Documentation and Code Readability#. Add clear documentation for every public function (see Documentation).; Add clear comments on the internal operation of functions so that anyone can read through the code quickly. If you’re not sure what a function does, e-mail the openbabel-devel list and it can be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally. Many methods are not particularly useful except inside the library itself.; Improve code indentation. It seems like a minor point, but the format of your code is important. As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list.

There are atoms and space. Everything else is opinion.; —Democritus. However, the valence model of chemistry has many shortcomings.

This is how; eMolecules’ basic searching works (see Sidebar). It’s simple and, because of the; high-performance indexes in eMolecules, is also very fast.; However, for general-purpose cheminformatics, one needs more power.; What if the substructure you’re looking for isn’t a valid molecule?; For example ClccBr (1,2- substitution on an aromatic ring) isn’t a; whole molecule, since the concept of aromaticity is only sensible; in the context of a whole ring system.; Or what if the thing we’re looking for isn’t a simple atom such as; Br, but rather a concept like “Halogen”? Or, “A terminal methyl”?; To address this, cheminformatics systems have special; query languages, such as SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target; Specification).

Usability,"ave a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions. If the flag is set, then IsAromatic() simply returns the corresponding value of the atom or bond flag.; If unset, then IsAromatic() triggers aromaticity perception (from scratch), and then returns the value of the flag. Perception of aromaticity#; It’s convenient to use the term “perception”, but what we mean is to apply an aromaticity model. Currently Open Babel only has a single aromaticity model, which is close to the Daylight aromaticity model. An aromaticity model describes how many pi electrons are contributed by each atom; if this sums to 4n+2 within a cycle, then all atoms and bonds in that cycle will be marked as aromatic.; Applying a model involves creating an instance of OBAromaticTyper(), and calling AssignAromaticFlags() passing an OBMol as a parameter. This wipes any existing flags, sets the atom and bond flags according to the model, and marks the aromaticity as perceived.; If you wish (and know what you are doing), you can apply your own aromaticity model by setting various atoms and bonds as aromatic and then marking t",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html:2032,simpl,simply,2032,docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability,"bviously is the easiest with text file formats. Binary files take some time to reverse engineer without documentation or working code. Also consider pointing developers to this FAQ and the “What’s in it for me?” section.; When I convert from SMILES to MOL2/PDB/etc., why are all of the coordinates zero?; The SMILES format contains 2D information on the molecule. That is, it says which atoms are connected to which other atoms, and what type of bonds are present. MOL2, PDB and several other formats contain 3D coordinate information not present in the SMILES format. Since Open Babel does not attempt to generate 3D structure by default, all of the coordinates are set to zero. However, it is possible to generate 3D structure with the release of Open Babel 2.2.0 using the --gen3d option.; What sorts of features will be added in the future?; It’s an open project, so if features are suggested or donated, they’ll be considered as much as anything else on the drawing board. Some things are pretty clear from the roadmap. What’s in it for me to contribute?#; What’s in it for my chemistry software company?; If your product is closed-source or otherwise incompatible with the GPL, you unfortunately cannot link directly to the code library. You can, however, distribute Open Babel in unmodified form with your products to use the command-line interface. This is fairly easy because the Open Babel babel program allow reading from the standard input and writing to the standard output (functioning as a POSIX pipe).; If you decide to distribute binaries, you should either offer users the source if they want, or point them to the Open Babel website. Note that if you modify the source, you obviously can’t point back to the Open Babel website – the GPL requires that you distribute the changed source.

User Guide; Contributing to Open Babel; Documentation. Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a new test). Modifying Old Code#; When modifying old code, please take a little time to improve the documentation of the function.; Even an “obvious” function must be documented, if for no other reason than to say, “This function does what you think, and has no side effects.”; Take :obapi:`OBAtom::SetAtomicNum() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::SetAtomicNum>` - should be “obvious”, right? Wrong. Does it affect the charge?; The spin multiplicity?; The implicit valence?; The hybridization?; What happens if I do SetHybridization(3) and then SetAtomicNum(1)?; Does the molecule have to be in the modify state?; If the molecule is not in the modify state, is it put into the modify state by SetAtomicNum()?; Does SetAtomicNum() cause a recomputation of aromaticity?.

Usability,"e meaning of the SMARTS string c1ccccc1F. Removing potentially toxic molecules; Filtering a dataset of molecules by substructure is particularly useful; if you need to remove molecules with problematic functional groups. For; example, particular functional groups are associated with toxicological; problems. Let’s filter the molecules using this substructure:. In the Options section, enter c1ccccc1F into the box labeled Convert only if match SMARTS or mols in file; Click CONVERT. How many structures are matched?. Now find all those that are not matched by preceding the SMARTS filter with a tilde ~, i.e. ~c1ccccc1F.; Click CONVERT. How many structures are not matched?. Filter by descriptor. Screenshot. As discussed above, Open Babel provides several descriptors. Here we will focus on the molecular weight, MW.; To begin with, let’s show the molecular weights in the depiction:. Clear the existing title by entering a single space into the box Add or replace molecule title; Set the title to the molecular weight by entering MW into the box Append properties or descriptors in list to title; Click CONVERT. You should see the molecular weight below each molecule in the depiction. Notice also that the SMILES output has the molecular weight beside each molecule. This could be useful for preparing a spreadsheet with the SMILES string and various calculated properties.; Now let’s sort by molecular weight:. Enter MW into the box Sort by descriptor and click CONVERT. Finally, here’s how to filter based on molecular weight. Note that none of the preceding steps are necessary for the filter to work. We will convert all those molecules with molecular weights between 300 and 320 (in the following expression & signifies Boolean AND):. Enter MW>300 & MW<320 into the box Filter convert only when tests are true and click CONVERT.

In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities. This depends only on the Conversion control module (obconversion.h is included), but not on the Chemical core or on any of the Formats.; The Fingerprint API, as well as being usable in external programs, is employed by the fastsearch and fingerprint formats.; The Fingerprints, which are bit arrays which describe an object and which facilitate fast searching. They are also built as plugins, registering themselves with their base class OBFingerprint which is in the Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts.

For example, if aspirin.smi contained O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C, it could be displayed with the aliases COOH and OAc by:; obabel aspirin.smi -O out.svg --genalias -xA. Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization. The available forcefields as listed as follows:; C:\>obabel -L forcefields; GAFF General Amber Force Field (GAFF).; Ghemical Ghemical force field.; MMFF94 MMFF94 force field.; MMFF94s MMFF94s force field.; UFF Universal Force Field. To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-bonded pairs (default = 10).

Filtering molecules from a multimolecule file#; Six of the options above can be used to filter molecules:. -s - convert molecules that match a SMARTS string; -v - convert molecules that don’t match a SMARTS string; -f and -l - convert molecules in a certain range; --unique - only convert unique molecules (that is, remove duplicates); --filter - convert molecules that meet specified chemical (and other) criteria. This section focuses on the --filter option, which is very versatile and can select a subset of molecules based either on properties imported with the molecule (as from a SDF file) or from calculations made by Open Babel on the molecule.; The aim has been to make the option flexible and intuitive to use; don’t be put off by the long description.; You use it like this:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""MW<130 ROTATABLE_BOND > 2"". It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added.

Usability,"ey need.; What’s in it for me as an academic?; If you’re an academic developer, you certainly should read the previous answer too. It takes little work on your part to interface with Open Babel and you get a lot in return.; But even if you’re just an academic user, there’s a lot of reasons to contribute. Most of us deal with a variety of file formats in our work. So it’s useful to translate these cleanly. If a format isn’t currently supported by Open Babel, see above. If you find bugs please report them. Since it’s open source, you can patch the code yourself, recompile and have the problem fixed very quickly.; If you’re inclined to write code, the GPL is an excellent option for the academic. You’re the original copyright holder, so you can do whatever you want with the code, in addition to selling it. But if you’ve also licensed it under the GPL, no one can distribute it as proprietary (i.e., closed-source) software without your agreement. Fellow academics can use it directly, learn from it, improve it and contribute back to you. Isn’t that why many of us went into science?; Once licensed under the GPL, the code must remain free to interested parties. If someone modifies it, that code must still remain under the GPL, free for all.; What’s in it for an open-source software project?; Certainly the answers for closed-source software and academics also apply for you. Beyond that, if your code is compatible with the GPL, you can directly use Open Babel and all of the API. This is already happening with the Avogadro molecular editor, available under the GPL, and many others (see related projects). There’s a lot of code in Open Babel beyond file translation and more to come. Why reinvent the wheel?; Why is this covered under the GPL instead of license X?; The short answer is that OpenEye Scientific Software employs Matt Stahl, one of the authors of the original Babel. They released a library called OELib under the GPL that did many things that Babel did. Later they decide",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:8807,learn,learn,8807,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,1,['learn'],['learn']

The Open Babel graphical user interface (GUI) is an; alternative to using the command line and has the same capabilities. Since Open Babel 2.3, the GUI is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. On Windows, you can find it in the Start Menu in the Open Babel folder; on Linux and MacOSX, the GUI can be started with the obgui command.; Since the functionality of the GUI mirrors that of obabel, you should consult the previous chapter to learn about available features and how to use them. This chapter describes the general use of the GUI and then focuses on features that are specific to the GUI. Basic operation#; Although the GUI presents many options, the basic operation is straightforward:. Select the type of the type of the input file from the dropdown list.; Click the “…” button and select the file. Its contents are displayed in the textbox below.; Choose the output format and file in a similar way. You can merely display the output without saving it by not selecting an output file or by checking “Output below only..”.; Click the “Convert” button. The message window below the button gives the number of molecules; converted, and the contents of the output file are displayed.; By default, all the molecules in an input file are converted if the; output format allows multiple molecules.

Usability,"molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds. Under the hood is a chemical registration technology based on Open Babel. The simplest query language for chemistry is SMILES itself: Just; specify a structure, such as Oc1ccccc1, and search. This is how; eMolecules’ basic searching works (see Sidebar). It’s simple and, because of the; high-performance indexes in eMolecules, is also very fast.; However, for general-purpose cheminformatics, one needs more power.; What if the substructure you’re looking for isn’t a valid molecule?; For example ClccBr (1,2- substitution on an aromatic ring) isn’t a; whole molecule, since the concept of aromaticity is only sensible; in the context of a whole ring system.; Or what if the thing we’re looking for isn’t a simple atom such as; Br, but rather a concept like “Halogen”? Or, “A terminal methyl”?; To address this, cheminformatics systems have special; query languages, such as SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target; Specification). SMARTS is a close cousin to SMILES, but it has; expressions instead of simple atoms and bonds. For example, [C,N]; will find an atom that is either carbon or nitrogen. IUPAC Names, Trade Names, Common Names#; Chemistry also has three other important name systems:.

Usability,"n be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally. Many methods are not particularly useful except inside the library itself.; Improve code indentation. It seems like a minor point, but the format of your code is important. As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Usability,"p to best practices.; With that in mind, the following sections describe the important task of software archeology – diving in to older parts of code and bringing them up to date. Whenever editing a file, please keep these in mind. Documentation and Code Readability#. Add clear documentation for every public function (see Documentation).; Add clear comments on the internal operation of functions so that anyone can read through the code quickly. If you’re not sure what a function does, e-mail the openbabel-devel list and it can be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally. Many methods are not particularly useful except inside the library itself.; Improve code indentation. It seems like a minor point, but the format of your code is important. As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, ST",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html:2176,Simpl,Simply,2176,docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,1,['Simpl'],['Simply']
Usability,"ple of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds. Under the hood is a chemical registration technology based on Open Babel. The simplest query language for chemistry is SMILES itself: Just; specify a structure, such as Oc1ccccc1, and search. This is how; eMolecules’ basic searching works (see Sidebar). It’s simple and, because of the; high-performance indexes in eMolecules, is also very fast.; However, for general-purpose cheminformatics, one needs more power.; What if the substructure you’re looking for isn’t a valid molecule?; For example ClccBr (1,2- substitution on an aromatic ring) isn’t a; whole molecule, since the concept of aromaticity is only sensible; in the context of a whole ring system.; Or what if the thing we’re looking for isn’t a simple atom such as; Br, but rather a concept like “Halogen”? Or, “A terminal methyl”?; To address this, cheminformatics systems have special; query languages, such as SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target; Specification). SMARTS is a close cousin to SMILES, but it has; expressions instead of simple atoms and bonds. For example, [C,N]; will find an atom that is either carbon or nitrogen.

Remove duplicate molecules#; The --unique option is used to remove, i.e. not output, any chemically identical molecules during conversion:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique [param]. The optional parameter param defines what is regarded as “chemically identical”. It can be the name of any descriptor, although not many are likely to be useful. If param is omitted, the InChI descriptor is used. Other useful descriptors are ‘cansmi’ and ‘cansmiNS’ (canonical SMILES, with and without stereochemical information),’title’ and truncated InChI (see below).; A message is output for each duplicate found:; Removed methyl benzene - a duplicate of toluene (#1). Clearly, this is more useful if each molecule has a title. The (#1) is the number of duplicates found so far.; If you wanted to identify duplicates but not output the unique molecules, you could use the null format:; obabel infile.xxx -onul --unique. Truncated InChI#; It is possible to relax the criterion by which molecules are regarded as “chemically identical” by using a truncated InChI specification as param. This takes advantage of the layered structure of InChI. So to remove duplicates, treating stereoisomers as the same molecule:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique /nostereo. Truncated InChI specifications start with / and are case-sensitive. param can be a concatenation of these e.g. /nochg/noiso:; /formula formula only; /connect formula and connectivity only; /nostereo ignore E/Z and sp3 stereochemistry; /nosp3 ignore sp3 stereochemistry; /noEZ ignore E/Z stereoochemistry; /nochg ignore charge and protonation; /noiso ignore isotopes.

Adding plugins; Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Contributing to Open Babel; Software Archaeology. Software Archaeology#; In any large software project, some parts of the code are revised and kept up-to-date more than others.; Conversely, some parts of the code begin to fall behind – the code may be poorly tested, poorly documented, and not always up to best practices.; With that in mind, the following sections describe the important task of software archeology – diving in to older parts of code and bringing them up to date. Whenever editing a file, please keep these in mind. Documentation and Code Readability#. Add clear documentation for every public function (see Documentation).; Add clear comments on the internal operation of functions so that anyone can read through the code quickly. If you’re not sure what a function does, e-mail the openbabel-devel list and it can be worked out. Mark functions which should be publicly visible and functions which are only useful internally. Many methods are not particularly useful except inside the library itself.; Improve code indentation. It seems like a minor point, but the format of your code is important. As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html:1569,clear,clear,1569,docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/SoftwareArchaeology.html,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"s an optional argument, fptype,; which should be one of the fingerprint types supported by OpenBabel; (see Molecular fingerprints and similarity searching). The; list of supported fingerprints is stored in the variable; fps.; If unspecified, the default fingerprint (FP2) is calculated.; Once created, the Fingerprint has two attributes: fp gives the; original OpenBabel vector corresponding to the fingerprint, and; bits gives a list of the bits that are set.; The Tanimoto coefficient of two Fingerprints can be calculated; using the | operator.; Here is an example of its use:; >>> from openbabel import pybel; >>> smiles = ['CCCC', 'CCCN']; >>> mols = [pybel.readstring(""smi"", x) for x in smiles] # Create a list of two molecules; >>> fps = [x.calcfp() for x in mols] # Calculate their fingerprints; >>> print(fps[0].bits, fps[1].bits); [261, 385, 671] [83, 261, 349, 671, 907]; >>> print(fps[0] | fps[1]) # Print the Tanimoto coefficient; 0.3333. SMARTS matching#; Pybel also provides a simplified API to the Open Babel SMARTS; pattern matcher. A; Smarts; object is created, and the; findall(); method is then used to return a list of the matches to a given; Molecule.; Here is an example of its use:; >>> mol = readstring(""smi"",""CCN(CC)CC"") # triethylamine; >>> smarts = Smarts(""[#6][#6]"") # Matches an ethyl group; >>> print(smarts.findall(mol)); [(1, 2), (4, 5), (6, 7)]. Combining Pybel with openbabel.py#; It is easy to combine the ease of use of Pybel with the; comprehensive coverage of the Open Babel toolkit that; openbabel.py provides. Pybel is really a wrapper around; openbabel.py, with the result that the OBAtom and OBMol used by; openbabel.py can be interconverted to the Atom and Molecule used by; Pybel.; The following example shows how to read a molecule from a PDB file; using Pybel, and then how to use openbabel.py to add hydrogens.

Usability,"situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:13418,simpl,simply,13418,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Modular design of code base#; Since version 2.0, Open Babel has had a modular structure. Particularly for the use of Open Babel as a chemical file format converter, it aims to:. separate the chemistry, the conversion process and the user interfaces, reducing, as far as possible, the dependency of one on another.; put all the code for each chemical format in one place (usually a single cpp file) and make the addition of new formats simple.; allow the format conversion of not just molecules, but also any other chemical objects, such as reactions. The structure of the Open Babel codebase broken down into modules#. The separate parts of the OpenBabel program are:. The Chemical core, which contains OBMol etc. and has all the chemical structure description and manipulation. This bit is the heart of the application and its API can be used as a chemical toolbox. It has no input/output capabilities.; The Formats, which read and write to files of different types. These classes are derived from a common base class, OBFormat, which is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion. This means the formats are plugins - new formats can be added with",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:3148,simpl,simple,3148,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"trahedral:; tetra = ob.toTetrahedralStereo(stereodata); if tetra.IsSpecified():; num_tetra += 1. Atom and Bond Ids; All of the stereo handling code uses Ids to reference atoms and bonds, rather than indices. An Open Babel atom has an index (OBAtom::GetIdx()) and an Id (OBAtom::GetId()). The former runs from 1 to the number of atoms. The latter can be anything (don’t assume it’s the Idx-1), but is unique within the molecule. If you delete an atom, the indices change, but the Ids do not. For this reason, all stereo is stored using Ids so that stereo information is not invalidated by changes to the molecule. When the stereochemistry description involves implicit hydrogens or lone pairs, the special atom Id OBStereo::ImplicitRef (numerically, -2 or 4294967294 if accessed via the bindings) is used. The code above is quite verbose, and requires iteration through all of the stereo data. To make it simpler to access stereo data for a particular atom or bond, a facade class OBStereoFacade can instead be used, which provides convenience functions for these operations:; num_cistrans = 0; num_tetra = 0. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""F/C=C/C[C@@H](Cl)Br""); m = mol.OBMol. facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m). for atom in ob.OBMolAtomIter(m):; mid = atom.GetId(); if facade.HasTetrahedralStereo(mid):; tetra = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(mid); if tetra.IsSpecified():; num_tetra += 1. for bond in ob.OBMolBondIter(m):; mid = bond.GetId(); if facade.HasCisTransStereo(mid):; cistrans = facade.GetCisTransStereo(mid); if cistrans.IsSpecified():; num_cistrans += 1. Note that every time you create a new OBStereoFacade, a certain amount of work is done building up the correspondance between atoms/bonds and stereo data. For this reason, a single OBStereoFacade should be created for a molecule and reused.

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a new test). Modifying Old Code#; When modifying old code, please take a little time to improve the documentation of the function.; Even an “obvious” function must be documented, if for no other reason than to say, “This function does what you think, and has no side effects.”; Take :obapi:`OBAtom::SetAtomicNum() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::SetAtomicNum>` - should be “obvious”, right?

Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a sh",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:146,Guid,Guide,146,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html:143,Guid,Guide,143,docs/WritePlugins/index.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

The following examples show how this is done. File conversion#; Let’s convert a PDB file to MOL format:. Create a folder on the Desktop called Work; Download the PDB file for insulin (4ins) from the Protein Data Bank and save it in the Work folder; Set the input file format to PDB and the input filename to the downloaded PDB file. Set the output file format to MOL and the output filename to file:4ins.mol in the Work folder. Now click CONVERT. Converting without files#; Rather than use input and output files, it is possible to paste the contents of a chemical file format into the input box, and see the results of the conversion in the output box.; Here we will try this with the SMILES format, and illustrate how stereochemistry is handled by SMILES:. Screenshot. Choose the SMILES format as the input format; Tick the box Input below (ignore input file); Copy and paste the following SMILES",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html:161,Guid,Guide,161,docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html:142,Guid,Guide,142,docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

User Guide; Introduction; Frequently... Frequently Asked Questions#. General#; What is Open Babel?; Put simply, Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and many related areas.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:155,Guid,Guide,155,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J.

Generate multiple conformers#; In contrast to conformer searching, the goal of conformer generation is not simply to find a low energy conformation but to generate several different conformations. Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:.

Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem.

Goals of the Open Babel project#; Open Babel is a project to facilitate the interconversion of chemical data from one format to another – including file formats of various types. This is important for the following reasons:. Multiple programs are often required in realistic workflows. These may include databases, modeling or computational programs, visualization programs, etc.; Many programs have individual data formats, and/or support only a small subset of other file types.; Chemical representations often vary considerably:. Some programs are 2D. Some are 3D. Some use fractional k-space coordinates.; Some programs use bonds and atoms of discrete types. Others use only atoms and electrons.; Some programs use symmetric representations. Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others.

User Guide; Handling of... Handling of aromaticity#; The purpose of this section is to give an overview of how Open Babel handles aromaticity. Given that atoms can be aromatic, bonds can be aromatic, and that molecules have a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions.

Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html:156,Guid,Guide,156,docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html:157,Guid,Guide,157,docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

Bond stretching; Angle bending; Dihedral torsions; Out-of-plane bending; Van der Waals repulsion; Atomic partial charges (electrostatic). Open Babel supports several force field methods.

The most common type of fingerprint is a series of binary digits (bits) that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing fingerprints allows you to determine the similarity between two molecules, to find matches to a query substructure, etc.; Open Babel provides several fingerprints of different types:. Fingerprint format: the path-based fingerprint FP2; substructure based fingerprints FP3, FP4 and MACCS; user-defined substructures; Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA) (mna): a circular fingerprint; MolPrint2D format (mpd): a circular fingerprint; Spectrophores™: a fingerprint that encodes the 3D structure of a molecule.

User Guide; Stereochemistry. Stereochemistry#; Open Babel stores stereochemistry as the relative arrangement of a set of atoms in space. For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”). Accessing stereochemistry information#; Each record of stereochemistry information around an atom or bond is stored as ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:144,Guid,Guide,144,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

What is Indexing?#; Indexing is pre-computing the answers to portions of expected; questions before they’re asked, so that when the question comes,; it can be answered quickly.; Take your favorite search engine (AOL, Yahoo!, Google, MSN, …); for example. Without indexing, they might wait until you ask for; “John Hartford Bluegrass”, then start searching the web, and in a; year or two find all the web pages about the deceased banjo/fiddle; player and steamboat captain. That would probably not impress you.; Instead, these search engines search the web before you ask your; question, and build an index of the words they find. When you; type in “Bluegrass John Hartford”, they already know all of the; pages that have “John”, all of the pages with “Hartford”, and all; of the pages with “Bluegrass”. Instead of searching, they examine; their index, and find pages that are on all three lists, and; quickly find your results.

Substructure and similarity searching a large dataset#; Open Babel provides a format called the fs -- fastsearch index which should be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:164,Guid,Guide,164,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']

Using this library, you can write your own custom scripts and software for yourself or others. Note; Any software that uses the Open Babel library must abide by terms of the GNU Public License version 2. This includes all of the supporting language bindings (for example, Python scripts) as well as C++ programs. To summarise, if you are considering distributing your software to other people, you must make your source code available to them on request. Open Babel is a C++ library and can easily be used from C++. In addition it can be accessed from Python, Perl, Ruby, CSharp and Java. These are referred to as language bindings (the Python bindings, etc.) and they were automatically generated from the C++ library using SWIG. For Python we also provide a module (Pybel) that makes it easier to access features of the bindings.

User Guide; obabel vs... obabel vs Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta#; The Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta is the brainchild of Andrew Dalke. It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used. Also the copy output format at present works only for files with Unix line endings. Heavy atom counts from an SD file#. For each record from the benzodiazepine file, print the total number of heavy atoms in each record (that is, exclude hydr",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/Rosetta.html:164,Guid,Guide,164,docs/Command-line_tools/Rosetta.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/Rosetta.html,3,['Guid'],['Guide']
