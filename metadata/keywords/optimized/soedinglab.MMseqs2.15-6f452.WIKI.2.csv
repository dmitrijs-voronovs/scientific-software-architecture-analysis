By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated. Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB cluDB_old newDB_updated cluDB_updated tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences.

The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow.

Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence using gapped local sequence alignment.

Energy Efficiency,"d clustering step.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on multiple cores and servers using OpenMP (OMP) and; message passing interface (MPI). MPI assigns database splits to each; servers and each server computes them using multiple cores (OMP).; Currently prefilter, align, result2profile, swapresults can take; advantage of MPI. To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence; set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all; queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is; split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk; against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less; time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it; reduces the memory required on each server to; (7 * N * L * #chunks + 21^k * 8) byte and allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers, chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of memory). Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the HAVE_MPI=1 flag (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..`).; Our precomplied static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI.

Energy Efficiency,"equence. It is possible to transform an external TSV in m8 format (BLAST tab) into an result file database using tsv2db. The m8 or tsv file must contains a self hit ""ID1 ID1 …."" for each entry in the sequence.fasta. Also we need to overwrite the identifier (first and second column) with numerical identifier for the sequence database before calling tsv2db.; awk 'NR == FNR { f[$2] = $1; next} { line = f[$1]""\t""f[$2]; for(i = 3; i <= NF; i++){ line=line""\t""$i } print line }' sequence.lookup result.m8 > result.m8.newid; mmseqs tsv2db result.m8.newid result. Now we should be able to use the internal clustering (greedy incremental, connected component, set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the defa",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/034eedf28f794df6124e32d2a8ecce6f6dacf563.html:99054,efficient,efficiently,99054,Home/034eedf28f794df6124e32d2a8ecce6f6dacf563.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/034eedf28f794df6124e32d2a8ecce6f6dacf563.html,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

However, MMseqs2's modules do not; use the FASTA format internally. Since the goal of this tutorial is to; make you an expert in using MMseqs2 workflows, we will explain and use; the MMseqs2 database formats and create FASTA files only for downstream; tools.; You can convert a FASTA file to the MMseqs2 database format using:; mmseqs createdb plass_proteins.faa plass_proteins_db. This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities.

These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disc space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM. The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (usually 21 including the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 a^k) byte. Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; To limit the memory use at the cost of longer runtimes, the option; --max-chunk-size allows the user to split the database into chunks of; the given maximum size.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time consuming step.

Since the goal of this tutorial is to; make you an expert in using MMseqs2 workflows, we will explain and use; the MMseqs2 database formats and create FASTA files only for downstream; tools.; You can convert a FASTA file to the MMseqs2 database format using:; mmseqs createdb plass_proteins.faa plass_proteins_db. This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

MMseqs2 will still use some additional memory for its database structures etc. In total, --split-memory-limit will be about 80% of the total memory required. Order of magnitude suffices can be passed to --split-memory-limit, such as 10G for ten gigabyte or 1T for one terabyte of RAM.; Database splitting runtime slowdown; Target database splitting primarily affects MMseqs2's runtime by introducing an additional result merging stage. The slowdown is less noticable on higher sensitivity levels, where the actual prefiltering dominates runtime and most noticable on lower sensitivity levels. We measured the search time with query sets containing 10000 and 100000 sequences through the UniProt database (Release 2017_03 with 80204488 sequences) using four sensitivity settings (faster, fast, default, and sensitive) and splitting the database into 1, 2, and 4 chunks. The peak memory consumption of the index table for the split levels of 1, 2, and 4 was 190GB, 101GB, and 57GB respectively.

We recommend using an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS). It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions. (1) Load the index; into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory; database by using the parameter --db-load-mode 3. (2) Do not create an; index, MMseqs2 will compute an index on the fly this reduces the IO; volume by roughly a factor of seven.; More details to the underlying search algorithm can be found here:; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively.

Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30).

Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary.

Energy Efficiency,"mmseqs prefilter queryDB targetDB resultDB_pref . MMseqs2 can handle profiles or protein/nucleotide sequences as input for the; queryDB. The prefilter k-mer match stage is key to the high speed and; sensitivity. It detects consecutive short words (""k-mer"") match on the same diagonal. The diagonal of a k-mer match is the difference between the positions of the two similar ''k''-mer in the query and in the target sequence.; The pre-computed index table for the target database (blue frame) contains for each possible ''k''-mer the list of the target sequences and positions where the k-mer occurs (green frame).; Query sequences/profiles are processed one by one (loop 1). For each overlapping, spaced query k-mer (loop 2), a list of all similar k-mer is generated (orange frame). The similarity threshold determines the list length and sets the trade-off between speed and sensitivity. The similar k-mer list length can be controlled with -s.; For each similar k-mer (loop 3) we look up the list of sequences and positions where it occurs (green frame). In loop 4 we detect consecutive double matches on the same diagonals (magenta and black frames).; For each consecutive k-mer matches an ungapped alignment is computed.; Only the maximal ungapped alignment score for each target is reported.; Set sensitivity -s parameter; The sensitivity of the prefiltering can be set using the -s option.; Internally, -s sets the average length of the lists of similar; k-mers per query sequence position. Similar k-mers list length: Low sensitivity yields short similar; k-mer lists. Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary. However, the sensitivity of the; search decreases, since only very similar k-mers are generated and; therefore, the prefiltering cannot identify sequence pairs with low; sequence identity.

The id 2 is the representatives sequence while 5 and 3 are members.; Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources; This section discusses how to keep the run time, memory and disc space; consumption of MMseqs2 at reasonable values, while obtaining results; with the highest possible sensitivity. These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disc space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM. The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (usually 21 including the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 a^k) byte. Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; To limit the memory use at the cost of longer runtimes, the option; --max-chunk-size allows the user to split the database into chunks of; the given maximum size.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time consuming step.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB oldDB_clustering outDB tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the results obtained by this older database; clustering, and the newer version of the sequence database.

Terminology; An MMseqs2 database seqTaxDB is a sequence database augmented with taxonomic information and a mapping file from each database key to its taxon id. Such a database includes the following files:; seqTaxDB, seqTaxDB.index, seqTaxDB.dbtype, seqTaxDB.lookup, seqTaxDB_h, seqTaxDB_h.index, seqTaxDB_h.dbtype, seqTaxDB_mapping and either the taxonomy flat file databases seqTaxDB_nodes.dmp, seqTaxDB_names.dmp, seqTaxDB_merged.dmp or seqTaxDB_taxonomy a binary version of the former files (created by createtaxdb which reduces the read-in time of the taxonomy database).; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB.

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage.

The id 2 is the representatives sequence while 5 and 3 are members.; Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources; This section discusses how to keep the run time, memory and disc space; consumption of MMseqs2 at reasonable values, while obtaining results; with the highest possible sensitivity. These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disc space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM. The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (usually 21 including the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 a^k) byte. Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; To limit the memory use at the cost of longer runtimes, the option; --max-chunk-size allows the user to split the database into chunks of; the given maximum size.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time consuming step.

Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; We introduced an extremely fast redundancy filtering preprocessing step; that can cluster sequences of identical length and overlap. It reduces; each sequence to a -letter alphabet, computes a CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Afterwards we begin with three the cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high results significance threshold in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity. In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity.

The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (does not include the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 20^k) byte.

Energy Efficiency,"searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. MMseqs2 is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers, making it highly scalable.; MMseqs2 matches the sensitivity of BLAST, but with several orders of magnitude faster speed. It can perform profile searches, like PSI-BLAST, but with a speed advantage of up to 400 times faster.; While MMseqs2 includes many more modules, the prefiltering and alignment modules are the core modules that underpin its algorithm. The prefiltering module performs a rapid and sensitive double consecutive k-mer matching-based calculation of similarities between sequences in a query database and a target database, followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module then performs a vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of sequences that pass a cut-off score in the prefiltering module. Both modules are parallelized to use all available computer cores, resulting in a highly efficient software suite. With its combination of sensitivity and speed, MMseqs2 can effectively search predicted ORFs in vast metagenomics datasets against the entire UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping similar sequences into clusters. It takes the similarity graph generated from the comparison of a sequence set with itself in the prefiltering or alignment modules as its input. Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set.

Now we should be able to use the internal clustering (greedy incremental, connected component, set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Energy Efficiency,"th a being the size of the amino acid alphabet (usually 20, the unknown amino acid X is excluded) and the k-mer size k.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on multiple cores and servers using OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI).; MPI assigns database splits to each compute node and each node computes them using multiple cores (OpenMP).; Most of the resource demanding modules of MMseqs2 such as prefilter or align can take advantage of MPI to speed up the computation.; To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it reduces the memory required on each server to (7 × N L/#chunks) byte + (a^k × 8) byte and allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers, chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of memory).; Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the -DHAVE_MPI=1 flag (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..). Our precompiled static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI.; To search with multiple server call the search workflow with the MPI command exported in the RUNNER environment variable.

Energy Efficiency,"tion of MMseqs2 at reasonable values, while obtaining results; with the highest possible sensitivity. These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disc space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM. The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (does not include the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 20^k) byte. Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; MMseqs2 will automatically split the database if the compute has not enough main memory.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time consuming step. It can scale; from minutes in runtime to days by adjusting the sensitivity setting.; Searching with 637000 protein sequences against 30 Mio Uniprot seqeunces; took around 12 minutes on a 16 cores.; Disc Space; The prefiltering results for very large databases can grow to; considerable sizes (in the order of TB) of the disc space if very long; result lists are allowed and no strict ungapped score threshold is set.; As an example, an all-against-all prefiltering run on the 25 Mio; s",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/5417e65f9ad99da70e3405d90702be111a23e783.html:48223,consumption,consumption,48223,Home/5417e65f9ad99da70e3405d90702be111a23e783.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/5417e65f9ad99da70e3405d90702be111a23e783.html,1,['consumption'],['consumption']

Energy Efficiency,"uence while 5 and 3 are members.; Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources; This section discusses how to keep the run time, memory and disc space; consumption of MMseqs2 at reasonable values, while obtaining results; with the highest possible sensitivity. These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disc space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM. The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (usually 21 including the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 a^k) byte.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single queries fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that cop",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html:120240,efficient,efficiently,120240,Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,108,['efficient'],['efficiently']

Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known.; Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.; This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care.

Then it adds; the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed from the newer database. Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Taxonomy assignment using mmseqs taxonomy. By identifying homologs through searches with reference databases with taxonomy annotations, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor of these homologs. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol with --lca-mode 2 (default) for chosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be then only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the one from blast2lca.

If you want to compile MMseqs2 on your own, install the following packages from Cygwin:; bash xxd cmake make gcc-g++ zlib-devel libbz2-devel busybox-standalone binutils. Afterwards, use a workflow similar to the util/build_windows.sh script to build MMseqs2 on Windows.; Use the Docker image; You can pull the official docker image by running:; docker pull soedinglab/mmseqs2. To use the MMseqs2 Docker container you have to mount a folder from the host system into the container with the -v argument. The following call mounts the current working directory under /app inside the container and then calls easy-search:; docker run -v ""$(pwd):/app"" soedinglab/mmseqs2 mmseqs easy-search /app/QUERY.fasta /app/DB.fasta /app/result.m8 /app/tmp.

Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on an accelerated approximation (Supp. Material in Mirdita et al., 2021) of the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et al., 2013) --lca-mode 3 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy calls an internal module lca that implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB. You can control the information provided about the lineage by using the tax-lineage parameter. The default mode is --tax-lineage 0 and does not include information about the ancestry of the assigned taxon. The mode --tax-lineage 1 will add a column with the full line",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:57371,protocol,protocol,57371,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,21,['protocol'],['protocol']

Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known.; Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.; This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Convert stockholm MSAs to a FASTA formatted MSA database.; mmseqs convertmsa Pfam-A.full.gz pfam_msa_db. Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html:106526,depend,depend,106526,Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,176,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"ing MMseqs2 from source has the advantage that it will be optimized to the specific system, which should improve its performance. To compile MMseqs2 git, g++ (4.6 or higher) and cmake (3.0 or higher) are needed. Afterwards, the MMseqs2 binary will be located in build/bin/.; git clone https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2.git; cd MMseqs2; mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..; make; make install ; export PATH=$(pwd)/bin/:$PATH. Compile from source under Mac OSX; ❗ Please install the gcc@7 zlib bzip2 vim cmake packages from Homebrew. The default MacOS clang compiler does not support OpenMP and MMseqs2 will not be able to run multithreaded. Use the following cmake call:; CXX=""$(brew --prefix)/bin/g++-7"" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..

Integrability,"l TB of disc space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Integrability,"mple how to build it yourself.; For the GTDB database see Create a seqTaxDB for GTDB.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy calls an internal module lca that implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB. You can control the information provided about the lineage by using the tax-lineage parameter. The default mode is --tax-lineage 0 and does not include information about the ancestry of the assigned taxon. The mode --tax-lineage 1 will add a column with the full lineage names, prefixed with their short rank (e.g., -_cellular organisms;d_Eukaryota;",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html:50143,protocol,protocol,50143,Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,46,['protocol'],['protocol']

Use empty lines to structure code in logical blocks or tasks.; Programming Practices; Logging errors or info messages; Do not use printf, std::cout, std::err (etc.) for printing messages. All output have to go through the Debug logging class.; Error handling; We do not use Exceptions in our code. We have two types of errors in MMseqs2.; Exceptions are disabled per compile flag.; 1) Errors which stop the run completely; Write a descriptive error message with Debug(Debug::ERROR) and exit out immediately with the EXIT macro.; Dot not use exit directly.

Additionally, we are providing a preview version for Windows.; The alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 (or optionally AVX2) and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disk space (~500 GB). In section; Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources,; we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disk space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; To check if MMseqs2 supports your system execute the following commands, depending on your operating system:; Check system requirements under Linux; [[ $(uname -m) == ""x86_64"" ]] && echo ""64bit Supported"" || echo ""64bit Unsupported""; cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c sse4_1 > /dev/null && echo ""SSE4.1 Supported"" || echo ""SSE4.1 Unsupported""; cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c avx2 > /dev/null && echo ""AVX2 Supported"" || echo ""AVX2 Unsupported"".

Integrability,"stering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database. Sequences which are not similar enough to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; clusterupdate creates a new sequence database newDB_updated that has consistent identifiers with the previous sequence databases. Meaning, the same sequences in both sets will have the same numeric identifier. All modules afterwards (for example convertalis) expect this sequence database to be passed.; Taxonomy assignment using mmseqs taxonomy. By identifying homologs through searches with taxonomy annotated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through an dynamic programming approach.; Prerequisites; The taxonomy workflow requires the NCBI taxonomy taxdump.tar.gz.

Modifiability," module needs, and options can be provided to modify the behavior of the module or change parameter settings. Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective; workflows are shell scripts that chain together elementary MMseqs2 modules and other workflows. A complete list of available modules can be obtained by running mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. This will give a short description, the usage text, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage string as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h. MMseqs2 workflows combine and chain these single-purpose modules into larger tasks, such as searching, clustering or taxonomic annotation. When you pass -h to a workflow it will show a combined list of parameters of all individual modules. Some parameter combinations might be non-sensical or conflicting. Generally, be careful when you change parameters from -h.; Easy Workflows in MMseqs2; MMseqs2 includes easy workflows like easy-search, easy-cluster, and easy-linclust, which are designed to simplify common tasks like searching and clustering using FASTA/FASTQ file formats.; Easy-Search; The easy-search workflow enables searching with a FASTA/FASTQ file against another FASTA/FASTQ file or a pre-built MMseqs2 target database.; mmseqs easy-search examples/QUERY.fasta examples/DB.fasta alnResult.m8 tmp.

Modifiability,", but more suitable for handling very large datasets efficiently.; Using MMseqs2 Workflows and Modules; While these easy workflows simplify tasks by directly working with common file formats like FASTA/FASTQ, MMseqs2 also offers a wide range of modules for more specialized operations like data transformation, filtering, and external program execution. These modules typically work with MMseqs2's internal database formats. For better performance and flexibility, it's often recommended to use MMseqs2's workflows and modules directly, especially for complex or large-scale bioinformatics analyses.; Downloading databases; Finding and setting up databases for different use cases can be a time-consuming; step.

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.; Example: computedValues or index; Local variable names; Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants.; Whitespace; Be generous with white spacing horizontally, but try to keep code compact vertically.; Here a _ characters indicates where you should be placing a space character",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html:3515,variab,variables,3515,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,1,['variab'],['variables']

It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h. Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

Modifiability,"e in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html:37509,extend,extended,37509,Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,186,['extend'],['extended']

The backtrace is however computed anyway (for the; calculation of the sequence identities) and then discarded.; How to run external tools for each database entry; The apply module can be used to call an external tools on each entry of a MMseqs2 database. It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database (with the same key). The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'. The apply module exports the MMSEQS_ENTRY_NAME environment variable into the called processes. It contains the current database key.; How to compute a multiple alignment for each cluster; There are two ways to produce MSAs from a clustering; (1) MMseqs2 mmseqs result2msa can produce a MSA using a centre star alignment without insertions in the query.; mmseqs cluster DB DB_clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB DB_clu DB_clu_msa.

We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears).

To compile MMseqs2, use the script in util/build_osx.sh. The resulting binary will be placed in OUTPUT_DIR/mmseqs.; To compile MMseqs2 with Clang, follow these steps:; ./util/build_osx.sh PATH_TO_MMSEQS2_REPO OUTPUT_DIR. Replace PATH_TO_MMSEQS2_REPO with the path to the MMseqs2 repository on your computer, and replace OUTPUT_DIR with the desired output directory.; Compiling using GCC; To compile MMseqs2 using GCC, please install the following packages with Homebrew:; brew install cmake gcc@12 zlib bzip2. After installing the necessary packages, use the following cmake command:; CC=""gcc-12"" CXX=""g++-12"" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..; make. This command sets the CC and CXX environment variables to use the gcc-12 and g++-12 compilers, respectively. It also sets the build type to Release and the installation prefix to the current directory. Install MMseqs2 for Windows (preview); If you are using Windows 10 or later, we recommend installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to use MMseqs2. To install WSL, please refer to Microsoft's documentation.; After installing WSL2 and rebooting, you can follow the Linux instructions above to install and use MMseqs2 on Windows.

Modifiability,"odule needs, and options can be optionally given to change parameter settings or modify the behavior of the module in some way. Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h.

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility.

Performance," Environment variables used by MMseqs2; External libraries used in MMseqs2; License terms. Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. MMseqs2 is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers, making it highly scalable.; MMseqs2 matches the sensitivity of BLAST, but with several orders of magnitude faster speed. It can perform profile searches, like PSI-BLAST, but with a speed advantage of up to 400 times faster.; While MMseqs2 includes many more modules, the prefiltering and alignment modules are the core modules that underpin its algorithm. The prefiltering module performs a rapid and sensitive double consecutive k-mer matching-based calculation of similarities between sequences in a query database and a target database, followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module then performs a vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of sequences that pass a cut-off score in the prefiltering module. Both modules are parallelized to use all available computer cores, resulting in a highly efficient software suite. With its combination of sensitivity and speed, MMseqs2 can effectively search predicted ORFs in vast metagenomics datasets against the entire UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping similar sequences into clusters. It takes the similarity graph generated from the comparison of a sequence set with itself in the prefiltering or alignment modules as its input. Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set. We use MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the UniProtKB database, ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:7502,perform,performs,7502,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['perform'],['performs']

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible.

Performance," a new Docker image with the tag mmseqs2 that you can use to run MMseqs2 in a containerized environment. Set up the Bash/Zsh command completion; MMseqs2 comes with a Bash command and parameter auto completion feature, which makes it easy to navigate and execute MMseqs2 modules, workflows and parameters by providing a list of available parameters or completing partially typed module/workflow names. To enable this feature, add the following lines to your $HOME/.bashrc:; if [ -f /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh ]; then; source /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh; fi. The Bash completion can also be used with Zsh by loading the bashcompinit compatibility shim first. Add the following lines to your $HOME/.zshrc:; if [ -f /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh ]; then; autoload -U +X compinit && compinit; autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit; source /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh; fi. Customizing compilation through CMake; Compiling MMseqs2 from source results in binaries that are optimized for the system on which MMseqs2 was compiled. Using these binaries on another system may lead to errors (e.g., Invalid instruction) or degraded performance. You can customize the compilation process by specifying the appropriate flags during the cmake call for your system. The following flags are available:. -DHAVE_AVX2=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE4_1=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE4.1 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE2=1: for old AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE2 instructions. -DHAVE_POWER9=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER9 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_POWER8=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER8 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_ARM8=1: for ARM64 systems with support for NEON instructions. You can also disable the automatic setup of architecture-specific compilation flags with -DNATIVE_ARCH=0. Use -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to set the flags for your system.

Performance," but less senstive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off the similar k-mers and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: 0). --max-accapet controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-reject aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit got accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the search. (Default: 1). --db-load-mode controls the behaviour how the database is loaded into memory, the main considertions It make sense to consider switching from. The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low.

Detailed Parameter List. Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to b",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2f0a12d7113a12899480dfa909a939af2d7ad033.html:4190,perform,perform,4190,Home/2f0a12d7113a12899480dfa909a939af2d7ad033.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2f0a12d7113a12899480dfa909a939af2d7ad033.html,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance," easy workflows.; How to search; You can use the query database ""QUERY.fasta"" and target database ""DB.fasta"" in the examples folder to test the search workflow. First, you need to convert the FASTA files into the MMseqs2 database format.; mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. If the target database will be used several times, we recommend to precompute an index of targetDB as this saves overhead computations. The index should be created on a computer that has the at least the same amount of memory as the computer that performs the search.; Transfer of large database files via NFS quickly becomes time-limiting for MMseqs2. Therefore, ideally the database and database index file should be stored on a fast local drive.; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp. MMseqs2 will create, if it does not exist already, a temporary directory tmp in which intermediate results are stored. You can also specify a different path, for example on a local drive to reduce load on a shared filesystem or to provide a fast local drive.; ❗ In MPI mode all databases and temporary directory need to be accessible by all nodes.; The mmseqs search searches the queryDB against the targetDB. The sensitivity can be adjusted with -s parameter and should be adapted based on your use case (see setting sensitivity -s parameter). If you require the exact alignment information in later steps add the option -a, without this parameter MMseqs2 will automatically decide if the exact alignment boundaries need to be saved to disk.; Please ensure that, in case of large input databases, the tmp directory provides enough free space.; Our user guide provides or information about disk space requirements.; To run the search execute:; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. Then convert the result database into a BLAST-tab formatted database (format: qId, tId, seqIdentity, alnLen, mismatchCnt, gapOpenCnt, qStart, qEnd, tStart, tEnd, eVal, bitScore).; mmseqs convertalis ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html:8215,load,load,8215,Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html,3,['load'],['load']

A precomputed index is only helpful if enough system RAM is available to keep the created index file fully resident in RAM. You can ensure that the precomputed index is fully in RAM with e.g. vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch):; sudo vmtouch -t -l -d -w uniref30_2103_db.idx. uniref30_2103_db.idx will contain all the databases mentioned above and can be searched as follows:; mmseqs search queryDB uniref30_2103_db res tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs expandaln queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs align queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign.m8 --db-load-mode 2. Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb.

The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole structure into memory.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Performance," mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be m",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/184b98015e720c8f2fcfcc62d249b38424ed1d01.html:4796,perform,perform,4796,Home/184b98015e720c8f2fcfcc62d249b38424ed1d01.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/184b98015e720c8f2fcfcc62d249b38424ed1d01.html,10,['perform'],['perform']

Given two protein sets 'A' and 'B', MMseqs2 can search in two directions and report pairs ('a','b'), such that 'b' is the highest scoring hit of 'a' and 'a' is the highest scoring hit of 'b':; mmseqs createdb Aproteins.fasta Adb; mmseqs createdb Bproteins.fasta Bdb; mmseqs rbh Adb Bdb ABrbh tmp. To obtain the results in m8 format:; mmseqs convertalis Adb Bdb ABrbh ABrbh.m8. Behind the scenes; The workflow searches with each 'a' against the targets in 'B'. It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user. The detailed parameter lists for the; modules is provided in section Detailed Parameter List.; MMseqs2 contains three core modules: prefiltering, alignment and; clustering.; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow.

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; # MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m; # no MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -f -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m.

Performance," read-in. We recommend using an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS). It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions. (1) Load the index; into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory; database by using the parameter --db-load-mode 3. (2) Do not create an; index, MMseqs2 will compute an index on the fly this reduces the IO; volume by roughly a factor of seven.; More details to the underlying search algorithm can be found here:; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb.

Performance," results are merged and the resulting clustering is; written to the output database.; Cascaded clustering yields more sensitive results than simple; clustering. Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transforms the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation the verticies represents the proteins, which are connected by an edge. An edge between proteins are introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) is an approximative algorithm for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover. Greedy set cover removes the node with most connections and all connected nodes. These form a cluster and the procedure repeats until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. Cluster member are assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologes. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible.

The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases a",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/6ad4eb61e80e7c9fb0ad0c275a3ef893fc6b44d3.html:4634,scalab,scalability,4634,Home/6ad4eb61e80e7c9fb0ad0c275a3ef893fc6b44d3.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/6ad4eb61e80e7c9fb0ad0c275a3ef893fc6b44d3.html,4,['scalab'],['scalability']
Performance," will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit got accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the search. (Default: 1). --min-ungapped-score the prefilter can filter based on the ungapped alignment score (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1dca39ddf2975265057cc134a0ab26aa9ec188d0.html:92468,perform,performs,92468,Home/1dca39ddf2975265057cc134a0ab26aa9ec188d0.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1dca39ddf2975265057cc134a0ab26aa9ec188d0.html,16,['perform'],['performs']
Performance," workflow combines the prefiltering and alignment modules into a; fast and sensitive batch sequence search that compares all; sequences in the query database with all sequences in the target; database.; Query and target databases may be identical. The program outputs for; each query sequence all database sequences satisfying the search; criteria (such as sensitivity).; MMseqs2 can precompute the prefilter index createindex to speed up; subsequent prefilter index read-in. We recommend using an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS). It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions. (1) Load the index; into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory; database by using the parameter --db-load-mode 3. (2) Do not create an; index, MMseqs2 will compute an index on the fly this reduces the IO; volume by roughly a factor of seven.; More details to the underlying search algorithm can be found here:; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the ca",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html:28658,load,load-mode,28658,Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,14,['load'],['load-mode']

Performance,", set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single (or small) query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow.

Performance,"-core processing and takes advantage of the SIMD capabilities of the host system. For optimal performance, we recommend a system with the AVX2 instruction set, although MMseqs2 can also run on systems with SSE4.1 or even SSE2. Additionally, MMseqs2 is compatible with the PPC64LE and ARM64 processor architectures, which require support for the AltiVec and NEON SIMD instruction sets, respectively.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may require a significant amount of main memory (see section memory requirements). To address this issue, we offer an option for limiting memory usage at the expense of longer runtimes. The database is split into chunks, with the program only retaining one chunk in memory at a time (see Database splitting runtime slowdown). If clustering large databases containing tens of millions of sequences, ensure that you have sufficient free disk space (~500 GB). In the section Optimizing sensitivity and consumption of resources, we will explore the runtime, memory, and disk space requirements of MMseqs2 and discuss ways to optimize resource usage for large databases.; To determine if MMseqs2 is supported on your system, run the following commands based on your operating system:; Check system requirements under Linux; [ $(uname -m) = ""x86_64"" ] && echo ""64bit: Yes"" || echo ""64bit: No""; grep -q avx2 /proc/cpuinfo && echo ""AVX2: Yes"" || echo ""AVX2: No""; grep -q sse4_1 /proc/cpuinfo && echo ""SSE4.1: Yes"" || echo ""SSE4.1: No""; # for very old systems which support neither SSE4.1 or AVX2; grep -q sse2 /proc/cpuinfo && echo ""SSE2: Yes"" || echo ""SSE2: No"". Note: MMseqs2 also supports Linux systems running on ARM64 (aarch64), so disregard the commands above for these systems.; Check system requirements under macOS; [ $(uname -m) = ""x86_64"" ] && echo ""64bit: Yes"" || echo ""64bit: No""; sysctl machdep.cpu.leaf7_features | grep -q AVX2 && echo ""AVX2: Yes"" || echo ""AVX2: No""; sysctl machdep.cpu.features | grep -q SSE4.1 && echo ""SSE4.1: Yes"" || echo ""SSE4.1: No",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:10091,optimiz,optimize,10091,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['optimiz'],['optimize']

The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity.

Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

Compile from source; Compiling MMseqs2 from source has the advantage that it will be optimized to the specific system, which should improve its performance. To compile MMseqs2 git, g++ (4.6 or higher) and cmake (3.0 or higher) are needed. Afterwards, the MMseqs2 binary will be located in the build/bin/ directory.; git clone https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2.git; cd MMseqs2; mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..; make; make install ; export PATH=$(pwd)/bin/:$PATH. ❗ To compile MMseqs2 on MacOS, first install the gcc compiler from Homebrew. The default MacOS clang compiler does not support OpenMP and MMseqs2 will only be able to use a single thread. Then use the following cmake call:; CXX=""$(brew --prefix)/bin/g++-8"" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. .. Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

Performance,"ST-tab formatted alignment results (see Searching section).; Sensitivity of the centroid search can be increased with the usual parameters (e.g. -s and --num-iterations).; Using a precomputed index with expandable profile databases; A precomputed index can be created to enable many rapid searches against an expandable profile database.; mmseqs tsv2exprofiledb uniref30_2103 uniref30_2103_db; mmseqs createindex uniref30_2103_db tmp --split 1. A precomputed index is only helpful if enough system RAM is available to keep the created index file fully resident in RAM. You can ensure that the precomputed index is fully in RAM with e.g. vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch):; sudo vmtouch -t -l -d -w uniref30_2103_db.idx. uniref30_2103_db.idx will contain all the databases mentioned above and can be searched as follows:; mmseqs search queryDB uniref30_2103_db res tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs expandaln queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs align queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign.m8 --db-load-mode 2. Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1).

Performance,"STX or TBLASTN search respectively. The search detect the open reading frames on all six frames and translates them into proteins. As default the minimum codon length of 30 (10 amino acids) is used.; To perform a search a BLASTX or TBLASTN create your database by using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

A TBLASTN like search ca be triggered using the nucleotide database on the target database side.; mmseqs search ecoli_proteins ecoli_genome outDB tmp. It is not out of the box possible to have nucleotide databases on both sides of the search workflow. The following workflow can be used to perform such a TBLASTX search:; mmseqs extractorfs genome genome_orfs --longest-orf --min-length 30 --max-length 48000; mmseqs translatenucs genome_orfs genome_orfs_aa; mmseqs search genome_orfs_aa ecoli_genome alnDB tmp; mmseqs offsetalignment genome_orfs ecoli_genome alnDB alnOffsetedDB. All open reading frames (ORFs) from each six frame can be; extracted by using extractorf. This ORFs are translated into proteins; by translatenucleotide. The tool offsetalignment will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases a",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/fcd88cd047d02b598a20dbf08cce1e26d562bdcd.html:9291,scalab,scalability,9291,Home/fcd88cd047d02b598a20dbf08cce1e26d562bdcd.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/fcd88cd047d02b598a20dbf08cce1e26d562bdcd.html,1,['scalab'],['scalability']

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; # MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b; # no MPI version ; cstranslate -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -f -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b. In the ""search"" case, those files are generated by MMseqs2, since it needs to merge the query and the target sequence databases.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% spe",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/45b4f5df08f73fe01b7953bf9a165425b45bac94.html:99268,load,load,99268,Home/45b4f5df08f73fe01b7953bf9a165425b45bac94.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/45b4f5df08f73fe01b7953bf9a165425b45bac94.html,2,['load'],['load']

Performance,"d component, set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore we turned of compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; How to build your own MMseqs2 compatible substitution matrices; You can use the (still Work in Progress) R script in util/format_substitution_matrix.R to prepare a substitution matrix for use in MMseqs2.

A precomputed index is only helpful if enough system RAM is available to keep the created index file fully resident in RAM. You can ensure that the precomputed index is fully in RAM with e.g. vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch):; sudo vmtouch -t -l -d -w uniref30_2103_db.idx. uniref30_2103_db.idx will contain all the databases mentioned above and can be searched as follows:; mmseqs search queryDB uniref30_2103_db res tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs expandaln queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs align queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB uniref30_2103_db.idx res_expanded res_expanded_realign.m8 --db-load-mode 2. Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. MMseqs2 is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers, making it highly scalable.; MMseqs2 matches the sensitivity of BLAST, but with several orders of magnitude faster speed. It can perform profile searches, like PSI-BLAST, but with a speed advantage of up to 400 times faster.; While MMseqs2 includes many more modules, the prefiltering and alignment modules are the core modules that underpin its algorithm. The prefiltering module performs a rapid and sensitive double consecutive k-mer matching-based calculation of similarities between sequences in a query database and a target database, followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module then performs a vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of sequences that pass a cut-off score in the prefiltering module. Both modules are parallelized to use all available computer cores, resulting in a highly efficient software suite. With its combination of sensitivity and speed, MMseqs2 can effectively search predicted ORFs in vast metagenomics datasets against the entire UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping simil",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:7029,perform,perform,7029,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['perform'],['perform']

To obtain the results in m8 format:; $ mmseqs convertalis Adb Bdb ABrbh ABrbh.m8. Behind the scenes; The workflow searches with each 'a' against the targets in 'B'. It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility.

How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single (or small) query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache m",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1a21527a3c3e8407fe60eba0a0d1cfc6f5ac6ca9.html:106208,load,load,106208,Home/1a21527a3c3e8407fe60eba0a0d1cfc6f5ac6ca9.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1a21527a3c3e8407fe60eba0a0d1cfc6f5ac6ca9.html,35,['load'],['load']

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible.

Performance,"e to perform a single step clustering using --single-step-clustering.; Cascaded clustering has many advantages but comes with one caveat. Since the representative of a cluster can change with every iteration it can happen that some members that were already close to a clustering do not fulfill the clustering criteria anymore. However, we can correct this by reassigning the sequences. To active the reassignment use --cluster-reassign. This mode removes sequences from the cascaded cluster result that do not fulfill the cluster criteria and reassigns them (if possible) to a different cluster.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transform the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, each vertex (i.e. node) represents a sequence, which is connected to other sequences by edges. An edge between a pair of sequences is introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; The Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover. Greedy set cover works by iteratively selecting the node with most connections and all its connected nodes to form a cluster and repeating until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs l",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html:42808,optimiz,optimization,42808,Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/01b802670fbdcf6850072cc13893a0f636857720.html,94,['optimiz'],['optimization']

It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30).

Performance,"eqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set. We use MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the UniProtKB database, which have been clustered down to a 30% sequence similarity threshold. This database is accessible at uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System requirements; MMseqs2 is compatible with modern UNIX-based operating systems and has been thoroughly tested on Linux and macOS. While we do provide a version of MMseqs2 for Windows, we recommend that users utilize the Linux version through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for the best performance and stability.; MMseqs2 utilizes OpenMP to enable multi-core processing and takes advantage of the SIMD capabilities of the host system. For optimal performance, we recommend a system with the AVX2 instruction set, although MMseqs2 can also run on systems with SSE4.1 or even SSE2. Additionally, MMseqs2 is compatible with the PPC64LE and ARM64 processor architectures, which require support for the AltiVec and NEON SIMD instruction sets, respectively.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may require a significant amount of main memory (see section memory requirements). To address this issue, we offer an option for limiting memory usage at the expense of longer runtimes. The database is split into chunks, with the program only retaining one chunk in memory at a time (see Database splitting runtime slowdown). If clustering large databases containing tens of millions of sequences, ensure that you have sufficient free disk space (~500 GB). In the section Optimizing sensitivity and consumption of resources, we will explore the runtime, memory, and disk space requirements of MMseqs2 and discuss ways to optimize resource usage for large databases.; To determine if MMseqs2 is supported on",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:9124,perform,performance,9124,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"g clustering is; written to the output database.; Cascaded clustering yields more sensitive results than simple; clustering. Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transform the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, each vertex (i.e. node) represents a sequence, which is connected to other sequences by edges. An edge between a pair of sequences is introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; The Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover. Greedy set cover works by iteratively selecting the node with most connections and all its connected nodes to form a cluster and repeating until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs l",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html:36286,optimiz,optimization,36286,Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/006266fe883cb587a5746361d719e5d3471cf2c8.html,89,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"g search algorithm can be found here:; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search create your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome ; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

Performance,"h full-path-to-mmseqs-binary intermediate-files-scratch-directory. It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Performance,"hould be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit got accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the search. (Default: 1). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html:90772,perform,performs,90772,Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html,1,['perform'],['performs']
