The first line is used as a caption for the GUI checkbox. Subsequent lines are shown when listed with the verbose option.; Line 7: WorksWith() identifies the type of object. Usually this is a molecule (OBMol) and the line is used as shown. The function is used by the GUI to display the option only when it is relevant. The OBOp base class doesn’t know about OBMol or OBConversion and so it can be used with any kind of object derived from OBBase (essentially anything). Although this means that the dependencies between one bit of the program and another are reduced, it does lead to some compromises, such as having to code WorksWith() explicitly rather than as a base class default. Line 12: This is a global instance which defines the Id of the class. This is the option name used on the command line, preceded by --.; Line 14: The Do() function carries out the operation on the target object. It should normally return true.

The display will give an overall impression of the set of molecules but details can be seen by zooming in with the mousewheel and panning by dragging with a mouse button depressed. The substructure that is being matched can be highlighted in the output molecules by adding another parameter to the -s option.

There are 15 false positives from the fingerprint stage. These are of no significance, but you can see them using:; obabel chembl_02.fs -O out.svg -s ~first.sdf.

Energy Efficiency,"een abstracted might commonly be represented by; something like: ; This uses implicit hydrogens and an explicit radical centre. But; sometimes the hydrogens are explicit and the radical centre; implicit, as when CH3is used to represent the methyl radical. How Open Babel does it#; Open Babel accepts molecules with explicit or implicit hydrogens and; can convert between the two. It will also handle radicals (and; other hydrogen-deficient species) with implicit hydrogen by using; internally a property of an atom, _spinmultiplicity, modelled on; the RAD property in MDL MOL files and also used in CML. This can be; regarded in the present context as a measure of the hydrogen; deficiency of an atom. Its value is:. 0 for normal atoms,; 2 for radical (missing one hydrogen) and; 1 or 3 for carbenes and nitrenes (missing two hydrogens). It happens that for some doubly deficient species, like carbene; CH2 and oxygen atoms, the singlet and triplet species are fairly close; in energy and both may be significant in certain applications such; as combustion, atmospheric or preparative organic chemistry, so it; is convenient that they can be described separately. There are of; course an infinity of other electronic configurations of molecules; but Open Babel has no special descriptors for them. However, even; more hydrogen-deficient atoms are indicated by the highest possible; value of spinmultiplicity (C atom has spin multiplicity of 5).; (This extends MDL’s RAD property which has a maximum value of 3.); If the spin multiplicity of an atom is not input explicitly, it is; set (in :obapi:`OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity() <OpenBabel::OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity>`) when the input format is; MOL, SMI, CML or Therm.

Energy Efficiency,"ereochemical information),’title’ and truncated InChI (see below).; A message is output for each duplicate found:; Removed methyl benzene - a duplicate of toluene (#1). Clearly, this is more useful if each molecule has a title. The (#1) is the number of duplicates found so far.; If you wanted to identify duplicates but not output the unique molecules, you could use the null format:; obabel infile.xxx -onul --unique. Truncated InChI#; It is possible to relax the criterion by which molecules are regarded as “chemically identical” by using a truncated InChI specification as param. This takes advantage of the layered structure of InChI. So to remove duplicates, treating stereoisomers as the same molecule:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique /nostereo. Truncated InChI specifications start with / and are case-sensitive. param can be a concatenation of these e.g. /nochg/noiso:; /formula formula only; /connect formula and connectivity only; /nostereo ignore E/Z and sp3 stereochemistry; /nosp3 ignore sp3 stereochemistry; /noEZ ignore E/Z stereoochemistry; /nochg ignore charge and protonation; /noiso ignore isotopes. Multiple files#; The input molecules do not have to be in a single file. So to collect all the unique molecules from a set of MOL files:; obabel *.mol uniquemols.sdf --unique. If you want the unique molecules to remain in individual files:; obabel *.mol U.mol -m --unique. On the GUI use the form:; obabel *.mol U*.mol --unique. Either form is acceptable on the Windows command line.; The unique molecules will be in files with the original name prefixed by ‘U’. Duplicate molecules will be in similar files but with zero length, which you will have to delete yourself. Aliases for chemical groups#; There is a limited amount of support for representing common chemical groups by an alias, e.g. benzoic acid as Ph-COOH, with two alias groups.

For example, if aspirin.smi contained O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C, it could be displayed with the aliases COOH and OAc by:; obabel aspirin.smi -O out.svg --genalias -xA. Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization. The available forcefields as listed as follows:; C:\>obabel -L forcefields; GAFF General Amber Force Field (GAFF).; Ghemical Ghemical force field.; MMFF94 MMFF94 force field.; MMFF94s MMFF94s force field.; UFF Universal Force Field. To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-bonded pairs (default = 10).

Combining Pybel with openbabel.py#; It is easy to combine the ease of use of Pybel with the; comprehensive coverage of the Open Babel toolkit that; openbabel.py provides. Pybel is really a wrapper around; openbabel.py, with the result that the OBAtom and OBMol used by; openbabel.py can be interconverted to the Atom and Molecule used by; Pybel.; The following example shows how to read a molecule from a PDB file; using Pybel, and then how to use openbabel.py to add hydrogens. It; also illustrates how to find out information on what methods and; classes are available, while at the interactive Python prompt.; >>> from openbabel import pybel; >>> mol = next(pybel.readfile(""pdb"", ""1PYB"")); >>> help(mol); Help on Molecule in module pybel object:; ...; | Attributes:; | atoms, charge, dim, energy, exactmass, flags, formula,; | mod, molwt, spin, sssr, title.; ...; | The original Open Babel molecule can be accessed using the attribute:; | OBMol; ...; >>> print(len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt); 3430 49315.2; >>> dir(mol.OBMol) # Show the list of methods provided by openbabel.py; ['AddAtom', 'AddBond', 'AddConformer', 'AddHydrogens', 'AddPolarHydrogens', ... ]; >>> mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(); >>> print(len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt); 7244 49406.0. The next example is an extension of one of the openbabel.py; examples at the top of this page. It shows how a molecule could be; created using openbabel.py, and then written to a file using; Pybel:; from openbabel import openbabel, pybel. mol = openbabel.OBMol(); a = mol.NewAtom(); a.SetAtomicNum(6) # carbon atom; a.SetVector(0.0, 1.0, 2.0) # coordinates; b = mol.NewAtom(); mol.AddBond(1, 2, 1) # atoms indexed from 1. pybelmol = pybel.Molecule(mol); pybelmol.write(""sdf"", ""outputfile.sdf""). previous; The openbabel module. next; Pybel API.

Gen3D#; To illustrate how some of the above methods might be used in practice, consider the gen3d operation. This operation (invoked using --gen3d at the commandline) generates 3D structures for 0D or 2D structures using the following series of steps, all of which have been described above:. Use the OBBuilder to create a 3D structure using rules and fragment templates; Do 250 steps of a steepest descent geometry optimization with the MMFF94; forcefield; Do 200 iterations of a Weighted Rotor conformational search (optimizing each; conformer with 25 steps of a steepest descent); Do 250 steps of a conjugate gradient geometry optimization. Taken together, all of these steps ensure that the generated structure is likely to be the global minimum energy conformer. However, for many applications where 100s if not 1000s of molecules need to be processed, gen3d is rather slow:. --fastest only generate coordinates, no force field or conformer search; --fast perform quick forcefield optimization; --medium (default) forcefield optimization + fast conformer search; --better more optimization + fast conformer search; --best more optimization + significant conformer search.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin.

In some cases, the entire set of conformations generated is also available. Many; of these methods include an option to optimize the geometry of conformations; during the search. This greatly slows down the procedure but may produce more; accurate results.; The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the speed/accuracy tradeoff with; which you are happy, and also on the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.; Are you looking for a reasonable structure for 3D display? Or are you looking; for a structure close to the global minimum?; To use from obabel, see the help for the conformer operation (obabel -L conformer). This operation is used both for conformer searching and for the genetic algorithm conformer generation described below.; Here is an example of use from Python:; >>> ff = ob.OBForceField.FindForceField(""mmff94""); >>> ff.Setup(obmol); True; >>> print(ff.Energy()); 15.179054202; >>> ff.SystematicRotorSearch(100); >>> print(ff.Energy()); 10.8861155747. Gen3D#; To illustrate how some of the above methods might be used in practice, consider the gen3d operation. This operation (invoked using --gen3d at the commandline) generates 3D structures for 0D or 2D structures using the following series of steps, all of which have been described above:. Use the OBBuilder to create a 3D structure using rules and fragment templates; Do 250 steps of a steepest descent geometry optimization with the MMFF94; forcefield; Do 200 iterations of a Weighted Rotor conformational search (optimizing each; conformer with 25 steps of a steepest descent); Do 250 steps of a conjugate gradient geometry optimization. Taken together, all of these steps ensure that the generated structure is likely to be the global minimum energy conformer. However, for many applications where 100s if not 1000s of molecules need to be processed, gen3d is rather slow:. --fastest only generate coo",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html:5085,Energy,Energy,5085,docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,1,['Energy'],['Energy']

Energy Efficiency,"iptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; 3D Structure Generation; Generate... Generate multiple conformers#; In contrast to conformer searching, the goal of conformer generation is not simply to find a low energy conformation but to generate several different conformations. Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:. Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer. Although labelled as “Conformer Searching”, if you choose the genetic algorithm method (which is the default) then you can save the conformers in the final generation using --writeconformers. For example, the following line creates 30 conformers optimized for RMSD diversity:; obabel startingConformer.mol -O ga_conformers.sdf --conformer --nconf 30; --score rmsd --writeconformers. In this case --score rmsd was not strictly necessary as RMSD diversity was the default in any case. Confab#; Confab systematically generates all diverse low-energy conformers for molecules. To run Confab use the --confab operation, and to assess the results by calculating RMSDs to reference structures, use the confabreport output format.; confab operator. obabel <inputfile> -O <outputfile> --confab [confab options] for typical usage;",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/multipleconformers.html:1925,energy,energy,1925,docs/3DStructureGen/multipleconformers.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/multipleconformers.html,1,['energy'],['energy']

The available forcefields as listed as follows:; C:\>obabel -L forcefields; GAFF General Amber Force Field (GAFF).; Ghemical Ghemical force field.; MMFF94 MMFF94 force field.; MMFF94s MMFF94s force field.; UFF Universal Force Field. To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:27719,energy,energy,27719,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,2,['energy'],['energy']

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:27990,energy,energy,27990,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['energy'],['energy']

User Guide; 3D Structure Generation; Generate a... Generate a single conformer#; There are several steps involved in generating a low-energy conformer from a 0D or 2D structure. OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J. Cheminf.* (2019) **11**, Art. 49.<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5>. Please cite this paper if you use the coordinate generation features in Open Babel.; The functionality of OBBuilder is not directly available through obabel but it is used as the necessary first step of the Gen3D operation discussed below. Conformer searching#; Given a 3D structure, the goal of conformer searching is to find a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching.

Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes. The default filter level is set to obWarning, which means that users are told of critical errors, but not non-standard formatting of input files.; A global error handler :obapi:`obErrorLog` (an instance of :obapi:`OBMessageHandler`) is defined and should be used as shown in the API documentation for the :obapi:`OBMessageHandler` class.

Since Open Babel 2.3.1 this can be done in one line:; obabel benzodiazepine.sdf.gz -O out.png -l16 --align -d -xu -xw 400 -xh 400; -s""[#7]~1~[#6]~[#6]~[#7]~[#6]~[#6]~2~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]12 green"". The depiction has some cosmetic tweaks: the substructure is highlighted in green; -d removes hydrogen; -xu removes the element specific coloring.; Open Babel also supports outputting SVG, which is resolution independent as a vector format.:; obabel benzodiazepine.sdf.gz -O out.svg -l16 --align -d -xu; -s""[#7]~1~[#6]~[#6]~[#7]~[#6]~[#6]~2~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]12 green"". In earlier versions the obfit program can be used. First extract the first molecule for the reference and the first 16 to be displayed:; obabel benzodiazepine.sdf.gz -O firstbenzo.sdf -l1; obabel benzodiazepine.sdf.gz -O sixteenbenzo.sdf -l16. Then use the program obfit, which is distributed with Open Babel:; obfit ""[#7]~1~[#6]~[#6]~[#7]~[#6]~[#6]~2~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]~[#6]12""; firstbenzo.sdf sixteenbenzo.sdf > 16out.sdf.

Energy Efficiency,"n theory one can create a canonical connection table,; too, but it’s not as useful since informatics systems usually have; trouble indexing BLOBs - large objects.). Line Notation versus Connection Tables: A practical matter#; Why are line notations preferred over connection-table formats? In; theory, either could express the same information. But there are; practical difference, mostly related to the complexity of “parsing”; a connection table. If you know that the whole molecule is on one; line of a file, it’s easy to parse.; Line notations are also very nice for database applications.; Relational databases have datatypes that, roughly speaking, are; divided into numbers, text, and “everything else”, also known as; “BLOBs” (Binary Large OBjects). You can store line notations in the; “text” fields much more easily than connection tables.; Line notations also have pragmatic advantages. Modern Unix-like; systems (such as UNIX, Linux and Cygwin) have a number of very; powerful “filter” text-processing programs that can be “piped”; together (connected end-to-end) to perform important tasks. For; example, to count the number of molecules containing aliphatic; nitrogen in a SMILES file, I can simply:; grep N file.smi | wc. (grep looks for a particular expression, in this case N, and; prints any line that contains it, and wc (“word count”) counts the; number of words and lines.); This is just a simple example of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”.

Or are you looking; for a structure close to the global minimum?; To use from obabel, see the help for the conformer operation (obabel -L conformer).

Gen3D#; To illustrate how some of the above methods might be used in practice, consider the gen3d operation. This operation (invoked using --gen3d at the commandline) generates 3D structures for 0D or 2D structures using the following series of steps, all of which have been described above:.

Taken together, all of these steps ensure that the generated structure is likely to be the global minimum energy conformer.

OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J. Cheminf.* (2019) **11**, Art. 49.<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5>. Please cite this paper if you use the coordinate generation features in Open Babel.; The functionality of OBBuilder is not directly available through obabel but it is used as the necessary first step of the Gen3D operation discussed below. Conformer searching#; Given a 3D structure, the goal of conformer searching is to find a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to one of a number of allowed values.

Energy Efficiency,"on of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J. Cheminf.* (2019) **11**, Art. 49.<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5>. Please cite this paper if you use the coordinate generation features in Open Babel.; The functionality of OBBuilder is not directly available through obabel but it is used as the necessary first step of the Gen3D operation discussed below. Conformer searching#; Given a 3D structure, the goal of conformer searching is to find a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to one of a number of allowed values. The allowed values are listed in the data file torlib.txt; for example, C-C bonds in alkanes have three allowed values: -60, 60 and 180. :obapi:`Systematic Rotor Search <SystematicRotorSearch>`: Systematically; iterate through all possible; conformers according to Open Babel’s torsion library.; This approach is thorough and will; find the global minimum. However as; the number of conformations increases by multiples for each additional; rotational bond, this can take quite a while for molecules with even just; 7 rotatable bonds.

User Guide; 3D Structure Generation; Generate... Generate multiple conformers#; In contrast to conformer searching, the goal of conformer generation is not simply to find a low energy conformation but to generate several different conformations. Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:. Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer. Although labelled as “Conformer Searching”, if you choose the genetic algorithm method (which is the default) then you can save the conformers in the final generation using --writeconformers. For example, the following line creates 30 conformers optimized for RMSD diversity:; obabel startingConformer.mol -O ga_conformers.sdf --conformer --nconf 30; --score rmsd --writeconformers. In this case --score rmsd was not strictly necessary as RMSD diversity was the default in any case.

Gen3D#; To illustrate how some of the above methods might be used in practice, consider the gen3d operation. This operation (invoked using --gen3d at the commandline) generates 3D structures for 0D or 2D structures using the following series of steps, all of which have been described above:. Use the OBBuilder to create a 3D structure using rules and fragment templates; Do 250 steps of a steepest descent geometry optimization with the MMFF94; forcefield; Do 200 iterations of a Weighted Rotor conformational search (optimizing each; conformer with 25 steps of a steepest descent); Do 250 steps of a conjugate gradient geometry optimization. Taken together, all of these steps ensure that the generated structure is likely to be the global minimum energy conformer. However, for many applications where 100s if not 1000s of molecules need to be processed, gen3d is rather slow:. --fastest only generate coordinates, no force field or conformer search; --fast perform quick forcefield optimization; --medium (default) forcefield optimization + fast conformer search; --better more optimization + fast conformer search; --best more optimization + significant conformer search.

Effect of modifying the structure#; Perhaps surprisingly, modifying the structure has no effect on the existing aromaticity flags; deleting an atom does not mark aromaticity as unperceived, nor indeed does any other change to the structure such as changing the atomic number of an atom or setting its charge; nor does the use of Begin/EndModify() affect the aromaticity flags. The only way to ensure that aromaticity is reperceived after modifying the structure is to explicitly mark it as unperceived.; The rationale for this is that an efficient toolkit should avoid unnecessary work. The toolkit does not know if a particular modification invalidates any aromaticity already perceived, or even if it did know, it cannot know whether the user actually wishes to invalidate it. It’s up to the user to tell the toolkit. This places more responsibility in the hands of the user, but also more power.; To illustrate, let’s consider what happens when the user reads benzene from the SMILES string c1ccccc1, and then modifies the structure by deleting an aromatic atom.; As this is an aromatic SMILES string, the SMILES reader will mark all atoms and bonds as aromatic. Next, the molecule itself is marked as not having aromaticity perceived (see previous section). After reading, we can trigger aromaticity perception by calling IsAromatic() on an atom; now, in addition to the atoms and bonds being marked as aromatic, the molecule itself will be marked as having aromaticity perceived.; If at this point we delete a carbon and write out a SMILES string, what will the result be? You may expect something like [CH]=CC=C[CH] (or C=CC=CC if we also adjust the hydrogen count on the neighbor atoms) but instead it will be [cH]ccc[cH] (or ccccc if hydrogens were adjusted).; This follows from the discussion above - structural modifications have no effect on aromat",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html:6063,power,power,6063,docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,1,['power'],['power']

No normalization (default); Normalization towards zero mean; Normalization towards standard deviation; Normalization towards zero mean and unit standard deviation. In all these cases, normalization is performed on a ‘per-property’ basis, which; means that the data points belonging to the same property set are treated as a; single set and that normalization is only performed on the data points within; each of these sets and not across all data points.; Normalization may be important when comparing the Spectrophores of charged; molecules with those of neutral molecules. For molecules carrying a global; positive charge, the resulting Spectrophore data points of the charge and; electrophilicity properties will both be shifted in absolute value compared to; the corresponding data points of the respective neutral species. Normalization; of the Spectrophores removes the original magnitude differences for the data; points corresponding to the charge and electrophilicity properties of charged; and neutral species. Therefore, if the emphasis of the virtual screening; consists of the identification of molecules with similar property fields without; taking into account differences in absolute charge, then Spectrophores; should be normalized towards zero mean. However, if absolute charge differences; should be taken into account to differentiate between molecules, unnormalized; Spectrophores are recommended. [bll2002]; P. Bultinck, W. Langenaeker, P.

This approach scales to the power of N, where N is the; number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Fast Rotor Search <FastRotorSearch>`: This iterates through the; same conformer space as the; SystematicRotorSearch but it greedily optimises the torsion angle at each; rotatable bond in turn, starting from the most central.

As with the Random Rotor Search, it randomly choses from; the allowed torsion angles but the choice is reweighted based on the energy; of the generated conformer. Over time, the generated conformer for each; step should become increasingly better. For each of these methods, the lowest energy conformation found is selected. In some cases, the entire set of conformations generated is also available. Many; of these methods include an option to optimize the geometry of conformations; during the search.

From an :obapi:`OBAtom`, using Atom(myOBAtom); By accessing the atoms attribute of a Molecule. Using Pybel with openbabel.py; It is always possible to access the OBMol or OBAtom on which a; Molecule or Atom is based, by accessing the appropriate attribute,; either .OBMol or .OBAtom. In this way, it is easy to; combine the convenience of pybel with the many additional; capabilities present in openbabel. See; Combining Pybel with openbabel.py; below. Molecules have the following attributes: atoms, charge, data, dim,; energy, exactmass, formula, molwt, spin, sssr, title; and unitcell (if crystal data). The atoms attribute provides a; list of the Atoms in a Molecule. The data attribute returns a; dictionary-like object for accessing and editing the data fields; associated with the molecule (technically, it’s a; MoleculeData; object, but you can use it like it’s a regular dictionary).

Energy Efficiency,"to focus on the relative differences between the; Spectrophore data points rather than focussing on the absolute differences.; In these cases, normalization of Spectrophores may be required. The current; implementation offers with the -n option the possibility to normalize in four; different ways:. No normalization (default); Normalization towards zero mean; Normalization towards standard deviation; Normalization towards zero mean and unit standard deviation. In all these cases, normalization is performed on a ‘per-property’ basis, which; means that the data points belonging to the same property set are treated as a; single set and that normalization is only performed on the data points within; each of these sets and not across all data points.; Normalization may be important when comparing the Spectrophores of charged; molecules with those of neutral molecules. For molecules carrying a global; positive charge, the resulting Spectrophore data points of the charge and; electrophilicity properties will both be shifted in absolute value compared to; the corresponding data points of the respective neutral species. Normalization; of the Spectrophores removes the original magnitude differences for the data; points corresponding to the charge and electrophilicity properties of charged; and neutral species. Therefore, if the emphasis of the virtual screening; consists of the identification of molecules with similar property fields without; taking into account differences in absolute charge, then Spectrophores; should be normalized towards zero mean. However, if absolute charge differences; should be taken into account to differentiate between molecules, unnormalized; Spectrophores are recommended. [bll2002]; P. Bultinck, W. Langenaeker, P.

Note that for both --energy and --minimize, hydrogens are made explicit before energy evaluation. Aligning molecules or substructures#; The --align option aligns molecules to the first molecule provided.; It is typically used with the -s option to specify an alignment; based on a substructure:; obabel pattern.www dataset.xxx -O outset.yyy -s SMARTS --align. Here, only molecules matching the specified SMARTS pattern are converted; and are aligned by; having all their atom coordinates modified. The atoms that are; used in the alignment are those matched by SMARTS in the first; output molecule. The subsequent molecules are aligned so that; the coordinates of atoms equivalent to these are as nearly as; possible the same as those of the pattern atoms.; The atoms in the various molecules can be in any order.; Tha alignment ignores hydrogen atoms but includes symmetry.; Note that the standalone program obfit has similar functionality.; The first input molecule could also be part of the data set:; obabel dataset.xxx -O outset.yyy -s SMARTS ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:29000,energy,energy,29000,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,2,['energy'],['energy']
Energy Efficiency,"to the trouble of reading the aromaticity and using it to kekulize, do we then effectively ignore it?; The reason is simply this: when writing an aromatic SMILES, we usually want to use our own aromaticity model and not that present in the input SMILES string. Otherwise, SMILES strings for the same molecule from different sources (that may use different aromaticity models) would not yield the same canonical SMILES string.; Of course, if the SMILES string came from Open Babel in the first place, we are doing unnecessary work when we keep reapplying the same aromaticity model. In this case, you can speed things up by using the a option, so that the aromaticity information present in the input is retained. The following examples show this in action:; $ obabel -:cc -osmi; C=C; $ obabel -:cc -osmi -aa; cc. Effect of modifying the structure#; Perhaps surprisingly, modifying the structure has no effect on the existing aromaticity flags; deleting an atom does not mark aromaticity as unperceived, nor indeed does any other change to the structure such as changing the atomic number of an atom or setting its charge; nor does the use of Begin/EndModify() affect the aromaticity flags. The only way to ensure that aromaticity is reperceived after modifying the structure is to explicitly mark it as unperceived.; The rationale for this is that an efficient toolkit should avoid unnecessary work. The toolkit does not know if a particular modification invalidates any aromaticity already perceived, or even if it did know, it cannot know whether the user actually wishes to invalidate it. It’s up to the user to tell the toolkit. This places more responsibility in the hands of the user, but also more power.; To illustrate, let’s consider what happens when the user reads benzene from the SMILES string c1ccccc1, and then modifies the structure by deleting an aromatic atom.; As this is an aromatic SMILES string, the SMILES reader will mark all atoms and bonds as aromatic. Next, the molecule its",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html:5472,charge,charge,5472,docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Aromaticity/Aromaticity.html,1,['charge'],['charge']

Energy Efficiency,"ypographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds. Under the hood is a chemical registration technology based on Open Babel. The simplest query language for chemistry is SMILES itself: Just; specify a structure, such as Oc1ccccc1, and search. This is how; eMolecules’ basic searching works (see Sidebar). It’s simple and, because of the; high-performance indexes in eMolecules, is also very fast.; However, for general-purpose cheminformatics, one needs more power.; What if the substructure you’re looking for isn’t a valid molecule?; For example ClccBr (1,2- substitution on an aromatic ring) isn’t a; whole molecule, since the concept of aromaticity is only sensible; in the context of a whole ring system.; Or what if the thing we’re looking for isn’t a simple atom such as; Br, but rather a concept like “Halogen”? Or, “A terminal methyl”?; To address this, cheminformatics systems have special; query languages, such as SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target; Specification). SMARTS is a close cousin to SMILES, but it has; expressions instead of simple atoms and bonds. For example, [C,N]; will find an atom that is either carbon or nitrogen.

The groups that are recognized and converted are a subset of those that are read. Displaying or writing them still requires the -xA option. For example, if aspirin.smi contained O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C, it could be displayed with the aliases COOH and OAc by:; obabel aspirin.smi -O out.svg --genalias -xA. Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization.

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutof",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:27775,energy,energy,27775,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,2,"['Energy', 'energy']","['Energy', 'energy']"

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a sh",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:877,Charge,Charge,877,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

Adding new operations and options#; The babel command line has the form:; babel inputfile [outputfile] [options]. There are several types of options:. Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html:879,Charge,Charge,879,docs/WritePlugins/index.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

The following examples show how this is done. File conversion#; Let’s convert a PDB file to MOL format:. Create a folder on the Desktop called Work; Download the PDB file for insulin (4ins) from the Protein Data Bank and save it in the Work folder; Set the input file format to PDB and the input filename to the downloaded PDB file. Set the output file format to MOL and the output filename to file:4ins.mol in the Work folder. Now click CONVERT. Converting without files#; Rather than use input and output files, it is possible to paste the contents of a chemical file format into the input box, and see the results of the conversion in the output box.; Here we will try this with the SMILES format, and illustrate how stereochemistry is handled by SMILES:. Screenshot. Choose the SMILES format as the input format; Tick the box Input below (ignore input file); Copy and paste the following SMILES",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html:914,Charge,Charge,914,docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html:873,Charge,Charge,873,docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

General#; What is Open Babel?; Put simply, Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and many related areas.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice.

OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J.

They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:.

User Guide; Introduction; Goals of... Goals of the Open Babel project#; Open Babel is a project to facilitate the interconversion of chemical data from one format to another – including file formats of various types. This is important for the following reasons:. Multiple programs are often required in realistic workflows. These may include databases, modeling or computational programs, visualization programs, etc.; Many programs have individual data formats, and/or support only a small subset of other file types.; Chemical representations often vary considerably:. Some programs are 2D. Some are 3D. Some use fractional k-space coordinates.; Some programs use bonds and atoms of discrete types. Others use only atoms and electrons.; Some programs use symmetric representations. Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others.

User Guide; Handling of... Handling of aromaticity#; The purpose of this section is to give an overview of how Open Babel handles aromaticity. Given that atoms can be aromatic, bonds can be aromatic, and that molecules have a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions.

Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html:892,Charge,Charge,892,docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html:893,Charge,Charge,893,docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']

Molecular Mechanics and Force Fields#; Used by a number of features, such as 3D coordinate generation,; conformer searching, etc., Open Babel provides support for a variety; of all-atom molecular mechanics force fields. The key idea is to use; classical mechanics to rapidly simulate molecular systems.; Each force field method is parameterized for a set of possible; molecules (e.g., proteins, organic molecules, etc.), building in; assumptions about how various aspects of the molecules contribute to; the overall potential energy.; The total potential energy of the system is usually given as a sum of; multiple components, including some or all of (but not limited to):. Bond stretching; Angle bending; Dihedral torsions; Out-of-plane bending; Van der Waals repulsion; Atomic partial charges (electrostatic). Open Babel supports several force field methods.

User Guide; Molecular... Molecular fingerprints and similarity searching#; Molecular fingerprints are a way of encoding the structure of a molecule. The most common type of fingerprint is a series of binary digits (bits) that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing fingerprints allows you to determine the similarity between two molecules, to find matches to a query substructure, etc.; Open Babel provides several fingerprints of different types:. Fingerprint format: the path-based fingerprint FP2; substructure based fingerprints FP3, FP4 and MACCS; user-defined substructures; Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA) (mna): a circular fingerprint; MolPrint2D format (mpd): a circular fingerprint; Spectrophores™: a fingerprint that encodes the 3D structure of a molecule. The next two sections describe the Fingerprint format and Spectrophores in depth. For the others, see the relevant sections listed above.

User Guide; Stereochemistry. Stereochemistry#; Open Babel stores stereochemistry as the relative arrangement of a set of atoms in space. For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”).

That would probably not impress you.; Instead, these search engines search the web before you ask your; question, and build an index of the words they find. When you; type in “Bluegrass John Hartford”, they already know all of the; pages that have “John”, all of the pages with “Hartford”, and all; of the pages with “Bluegrass”.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option.

It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used.

Integrability," Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts. Several formats or fingerprints may be present in a single dynamic library.; Alternatively, and most commonly, the same source code can be built into a single executable. The restricted dependencies still provide easier program maintenance.; This segregation means that a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows. So some discipline is needed when adding new code, and sometimes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol files with code from mdlformat. The calling format should not use the code directly but should do it through a OBConversion object configured with the appropriate helper format.; The objects passed between the modules in the diagram above are polymorphic :obapi:`OBBase` pointers. This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code.

Pybel#; Pybel provides convenience functions and classes that make it; simpler to use the Open Babel libraries from Python, especially for; file input/output and for accessing the attributes of atoms and; molecules. The Atom and Molecule classes used by Pybel can be; converted to and from the OBAtom and OBMol used by the; openbabel module. These features are discussed in more detail; below.; The rationale and technical details behind Pybel are described in O’Boyle et al [omh2008]. To support further development of Pybel, please cite this paper if you use Pybel to obtain results for publication.; Information on the Pybel API can be found at the interactive Python; prompt using the help() function.

What’s new from 1.100.2#; This release represents Open Babel’s fourth “birthday” and a milestone for; a stable, flexible interface for developers and users alike. New conversion framework. The new framework allows dynamicloading/unloading of file translator modules (i.e., shared; libraries, DLLs, DSO, etc.). More importantly, it facilitates adding; new formats, since each format is self-contained and no editing of; other files is required. Improved support for XML chemistry formats, including CML, PubChem XML,. Support for fingerprinting and calculation of Tanimoto coefficients forsimilarity consideration.; (A flexible fingerprint framework is available for developers.). New support for Perl and Python “wrappers” of the Open Babel library. Many enhancements to the Open Babel API: See the Developers API Notes formore information. Some code will require updating, see the; Developer’s Migration Guide for details. Support for automatically reading .gz compressed files.(e.g., 1abc.pdb.gz is uncompressed and treated as a PDB file); Use of the -z flag creates gzip-compressed output files. Support for the new IUPAC InChI identifiers. Improved bond order typing, including flexible SMARTS matching inbondtyp.txt. New Kekulization routine – improves aromaticity detection in aromatic amineslike pyrroles, porphyrins, etc. Improved support for radicals and spin multiplicity, includingassignment of hydrogens to radicals. Improved support for 2D vs. 3D file formats. New error logging framework keeps an “audit log” of changes to files(hydrogen addition, bond order assignment) and different levels of; error reporting / debugging.; Use the “—errorlevel 4” flag to access this information.

Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes.

Integrability," is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion. This means the formats are plugins - new formats can be added without changing any framework code.; Common Formats include OBMoleculeFormats and XMLBaseFormat from which most other formats (like Format A and Format B in the diagram) are derived. Independent formats like Format C are also possible.; The Conversion control, which also keeps track of the available formats, the conversion options and the input and output streams. It can be compiled without reference to any other parts of the program. In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities. This depends only on the Conversion control module (obconversion.h is included), but not on the Chemical core or on any of the Formats.; The Fingerprint API, as well as being usable in external programs, is employed by the fastsearch and fingerprint formats.; The Fingerprints, which are bit arrays which describe an object and which facilitate fast searching. They are also built as plugins, registering themselves with their base class OBFingerprint which is in the Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts.

The variables are accessible through get methods.; When accessing various types of :obapi:`OBGenericData`, you will need to cast them to the particular subclass using the global functions, toPairData, toUnitCell, etc.; The Java versions of the iterator classes in the C++ API (that is, all those classes ending in Iter) implement the Iterator and Iterable interfaces. This means that the following foreach loop is possible:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetAtomicNum());; }. To facilitate use of the :obapi:`OBMolAtomBFSIter`, OBAtom has been extended to incorporate a CurrentDepth value, accessible through a get method:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomBFSIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetCurrentDepth());; }. previous; Examples. next; Perl.

User Guide; Install Open Babel. Install Open Babel#; Open Babel runs on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. You can either install a binary package (the easiest option) or compile Open Babel yourself (also easy, but much more geek cred). Install a binary package#. Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the feature",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:1281,interface,interface,1281,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,1,['interface'],['interface']

Using a restricted set of formats#; It is likely that you will only be interested in a subset of the large range of formats handled by Open Babel.; You can restrict; the choice offered in the dropdown boxes, which makes routine; selection easier. Clicking “Select set of formats” on the View menu; allows the formats to be displayed to be selected. Subsequently,; clicking “Use restricted set of formats” on the View menu toggles; this facility on and off.; Using a restricted set overcomes an irritating bug in the Windows; version. In the file Open and Save dialogs the files displayed can; be filtered by the current format, All Chemical Formats, or All; Files. The All Chemical Formats filter will only display the first; 30 possible formats (alphabetically). The All Files will indeed; display all files and the conversion processes are unaffected. Other features#; Most of the interface parameters, such as the selected format and; the window size and position, are remembered between sessions.; Using the View menu, the input and output text boxes can be set not; to wrap the text. At present you have to restart the program for; this to take effect.; The message box at the top of the output text window receives; program output on error and audit logging, and some progress; reports. It can be expanded by dragging down the divider between; the windows. Example files#; In the Windows distribution, there are three chemical files included to try out:. serotonin.mol which has 3D atom coordinates; oxamide.cml which is 2D and has a large number of properties that will be seen when converting to SDF; FourSmallMols.cml which (unsurprisingly) contains four molecules with no atom coordinates and can be used to illustrate the handling of multiple molecules:; Setting the output format to SMI (which is easy to see), you can convert only the second and third molecules by entering 2 and 3 in the appropriate option boxes.",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUI/GUI.html:6739,interface,interface,6739,docs/GUI/GUI.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUI/GUI.html,1,['interface'],['interface']

In particular, the output states that 206983 and 207022 are possible superstructures of the query molecule, and that is indeed true. How many of the molecules in the dataset are superstructures of the molecule in first.sdf? To do this and to visualize the large numbers of molecules produced, we can output to SVG format (see SVG 2D depiction (svg)):; obabel chembl_02.fs -O out.svg -s first.sdf. Note that obabel has been used here because of its more flexible option handling.; This command does a substructure search and puts the 47 matching structures in the file out.svg.

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a new test).

User Guide; Write software using the Open Babel library; Updating to... Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; with obabel, no such restriction applies. Because of the original design of babel, it is not possible to add this capability in a backwards-compatible way.; obabel has a shortcut for entering SMILES strings. Precede the SMILES by -: and use in place of an input file.

However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -aS -osmi; FC(F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br.

End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code.

Integrability,"d later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` at the end. This will ensure that perception routines do not run while you read in a molecule and are reset after your code finishes (see Lazy Evaluation).; Currently, lazy perception does not include connectivity and bond order assignment. If your format does not include bonds, make sure to call :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` and :obapi:`OBMol::PerceiveBondOrders() <OpenBabel::OBMol::PerceiveBondOrders>` after :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` to ensure bonds are assigned.; Consider various input and output options that users can set from the command-line or GUI. For example, many quantum mechanics formats (as well as other formats which do not recognize bonds) offer the following options:; -as Call only :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` (single bonds only); -ab No bond perception. Make sure to use generic data classes like :obapi:`OBUnitCell` and others as appropriate.

Usually this is a molecule (OBMol) and the line is used as shown. The function is used by the GUI to display the option only when it is relevant. The OBOp base class doesn’t know about OBMol or OBConversion and so it can be used with any kind of object derived from OBBase (essentially anything). Although this means that the dependencies between one bit of the program and another are reduced, it does lead to some compromises, such as having to code WorksWith() explicitly rather than as a base class default. Line 12: This is a global instance which defines the Id of the class. This is the option name used on the command line, preceded by --.; Line 14: The Do() function carries out the operation on the target object. It should normally return true.

MOL2, PDB and several other formats contain 3D coordinate information not present in the SMILES format.

However, it is possible to generate 3D structure with the release of Open Babel 2.2.0 using the --gen3d option.; What sorts of features will be added in the future?; It’s an open project, so if features are suggested or donated, they’ll be considered as much as anything else on the drawing board.

What’s in it for me to contribute?#; What’s in it for my chemistry software company?; If your product is closed-source or otherwise incompatible with the GPL, you unfortunately cannot link directly to the code library. You can, however, distribute Open Babel in unmodified form with your products to use the command-line interface. This is fairly easy because the Open Babel babel program allow reading from the standard input and writing to the standard output (functioning as a POSIX pipe).; If you decide to distribute binaries, you should either offer users the source if they want, or point them to the Open Babel website. Note that if you modify the source, you obviously can’t point back to the Open Babel website – the GPL requires that you distribute the changed source. (Or you can convince us to incorporate the changes and point back to us.); What’s not to like with this deal? You can have Open Babel translate foreign file formats for you and can point users at the website for distribution. You don’t need to write tons of code for all these formats and bug reports can be passed back to us.; Of course, there’s one catch.

Remove duplicate molecules#; The --unique option is used to remove, i.e. not output, any chemically identical molecules during conversion:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique [param]. The optional parameter param defines what is regarded as “chemically identical”. It can be the name of any descriptor, although not many are likely to be useful. If param is omitted, the InChI descriptor is used. Other useful descriptors are ‘cansmi’ and ‘cansmiNS’ (canonical SMILES, with and without stereochemical information),’title’ and truncated InChI (see below).; A message is output for each duplicate found:; Removed methyl benzene - a duplicate of toluene (#1). Clearly, this is more useful if each molecule has a title. The (#1) is the number of duplicates found so far.; If you wanted to identify duplicates but not output the unique molecules, you could use the null format:; obabel infile.xxx -onul --unique. Truncated InChI#; It is possible to relax the criterion by which molecules are regarded as “chemically identical” by using a truncated InChI specification as param. This takes advantage of the layered structure of InChI. So to remove duplicates, treating stereoisomers as the same molecule:; obabel infile.xxx outfile.yyy --unique /nostereo. Truncated InChI specifications start with / and are case-sensitive. param can be a concatenation of these e.g. /nochg/noiso:; /formula formula only; /connect formula and connectivity only; /nostereo ignore E/Z and sp3 stereochemistry; /nosp3 ignore sp3 stereochemistry; /noEZ ignore E/Z stereoochemistry; /nochg ignore charge and protonation; /noiso ignor",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:24398,message,message,24398,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['message'],['message']

Since it’s open source, you can patch the code yourself, recompile and have the problem fixed very quickly.; If you’re inclined to write code, the GPL is an excellent option for the academic. You’re the original copyright holder, so you can do whatever you want with the code, in addition to selling it. But if you’ve also licensed it under the GPL, no one can distribute it as proprietary (i.e., closed-source) software without your agreement.

Molecules having similar; three-dimensional properties and shapes always yield similar Spectrophores.; A Spectrophore is calculated by surrounding the three-dimensional; conformation of the molecule by a three-dimensional arrangement of points,; followed by calculating the interaction between each of the atom properties and; the surrounding the points. The three-dimensional arrangement of the points; surrounding the molecule can be regarded as an ‘artificial’ cage or receptor,; and the interaction calculated between the molecule and the cage can be regarded; as an artificial representation of an affinity value between molecule and cage.; Because the calculated interaction is dependent on the relative orientation of; the molecule within the cage, the molecule is rotated in discrete angles and the; most favorable interaction value is kept as final result. The angular stepsize; at which the molecule is rotated along its three axis can be specified by the; user and influences the accuracy of the method.; The Spectrophore code was developed by Silicos NV, and donated to the OpenBabel project in July 2010 (see sidebar for information on commercial support).

As a result, a Spectrophore is organized as a vector of minimized; interaction values V, each of these organized in order of cages and; property values. Since for a typical Spectrophore implementation twelve; different cages are used, the total length of a Spectrophore vector equals; to 12 times the number of properties. Since four different properties are used; in the current implementation (electrostatic, lipophilic, electrophilic; potentials, and an additional shape index as described before), this leads to a; total Spectrophore length of 48 real values per molecular conformation.; Since Spectrophore descriptors are dependent on the actual; three-dimensional conformation of the molecule, a typical analysis includes the; calculation of Spectrophores from a reasonable set of different; conformations.

They are also built as plugins, registering themselves with their base class OBFingerprint which is in the Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts. Several formats or fingerprints may be present in a single dynamic library.; Alternatively, and most commonly, the same source code can be built into a single executable. The restricted dependencies still provide easier program maintenance.; This segregation means that a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows. So some discipline is needed when adding new code, and sometimes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol files with code from mdlformat.

Integrability,"ove, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived then stereo perception is not performed. Any operations that require stereo information should call PerceiveStereo before accessing stereo information.; Behind the scenes, the code for stereo perception is quite different depending on the dimensionality (OBMol::GetDimension()) of the molecule.; 3D structures; Perhaps the most straightforward is when the structure has 3D coordinates. In this case, a symmetry analysis identifies stereogenic centers whose stereoconfigurations are then perceived from the coordinates. Some file formats such as the MOL file allow atoms and double bonds to be marked as have unspecified stereochemistry, and this information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; IC=CC[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -as -osmi; IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F.

In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities. This depends only on the Conversion control module (obconversion.h is included), but not on the Chemical core or on any of the Formats.; The Fingerprint API, as well as being usable in external programs, is employed by the fastsearch and fingerprint formats.; The Fingerprints, which are bit arrays which describe an object and which facilitate fast searching. They are also built as plugins, registering themselves with their base class OBFingerprint which is in the Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts. Several formats or fingerprints may be present in a single dynamic library.; Alternatively, and most commonly, the same source code can be built into a single executable. The restricted dependencies still provide easier program maintenance.; This segregation means that a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows. So some discipline is needed when adding new code, and sometimes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol fil",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:5530,depend,dependencies,5530,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"s easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxWidgets 2.8 (or newer). Binary packages may be available through your package manager (wx-common, wx2.8-headers and libwxbase2.8-dev on Ubuntu) or from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Otherwise, you could try compiling it yourself from the source code. The following are optional when compiling Open Babel, but if not available some features will be missing:. libxml2 development headers are required to read/write CML files and other XML formats (the libxml2-dev package in Ubuntu); zlib development libraries are required to support reading gzipped files (the zlib1g-dev package in Ubuntu); Eigen version 2 or newer is required if using the language bindings in the release. In addition, if it not present, some API classes (OBAlign, OBConformerSearch) and plugins (the QEq and QTPIE charge models, the --conformer and --align operations) will not be available.; Eigen may be available through your package manager (the libeigen2-dev package i",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:3449,Interface,Interface,3449,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,1,['Interface'],['Interface']

So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’. SMARTS descriptor#; This descriptor will do a SMARTS test (substructure and more) on the molecules. The smarts ID can be abbreviated to s and the = is optional. More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"". This provides a more flexible alternative to the existing -s and -v options, since the SMARTS descriptor test can be combined with other tests. InChI descriptor#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'"". will convert only ethanol. It uses the default parameters for InChI comparison, so there may be some messages from the InChI code. There is quite a lot of flexibility on how the InChI is presented (you can miss out the non-essential bits):; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3"". all have the same effect.; The comparison of the InChI string is done only as far as the parameter’s length. This means that we can take advantage of InChI’s layered structure:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O"". will convert both Ethanol and Dimethyl Ether.

The Open Babel graphical user interface (GUI) is an; alternative to using the command line and has the same capabilities. Since Open Babel 2.3, the GUI is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. On Windows, you can find it in the Start Menu in the Open Babel folder; on Linux and MacOSX, the GUI can be started with the obgui command.; Since the functionality of the GUI mirrors that of obabel, you should consult the previous chapter to learn about available features and how to use them. This chapter describes the general use of the GUI and then focuses on features that are specific to the GUI.

Integrability,"the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the test fails. (test_runner is a testing harness generated by CMake.). python test\testbindings.py TestSuite.testAsterisk; This will run the testAsterisk test in testbindings.py.

This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes. The default filter level is set to obWarning, which means that users are told of critical errors, but not non-standard formatting of input files.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:7605,message,messages,7605,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['message'],['messages']

Modifiability," As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes. Patches and contributions towards any of these tasks will be greatly appreciated. previous; Adding a new test. next; Adding plugins. On this page; .

Modifiability," Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -aS -osmi; FC(F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br.

Modifiability," Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxW",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:2516,plugin,plugin,2516,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['plugin'],"['plugin', 'plugins']"

Modifiability," a single OBStereoFacade should be created for a molecule and reused. The Config() object#; The description of the stereochemical configuration is accessed via a Config() object associated with each StereoData. The contents of this object will be different depending on the specific type of stereochemistry, e.g. OBCisTransStereo::Config (OBCisTransConfig from Python) records the begin and end Ids of the associated bond, the Ids of the attached atoms, the spatial relationship of those atoms, and whether stereo is specified.; Let’s read the SMILES string F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I and access the stereo. When we read this SMILES string, the tetrahedral center will be the second atom, that with Idx 2.:; smi = ""F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I""; mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).OBMol; secondatom = mol.GetAtom(2); atomid = secondatom.GetId(). stereofacade = ob.OBStereoFacade(mol); print(""Does this atom have tet stereo info?"", stereofacade.HasTetrahedralStereo(atomid)); tetstereo = stereofacade.GetTetrahedralStereo(atomid); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); print(""The stereocenter is at atom Id {}"".format(config.center)); print(""Is the configuration specified? {}"".format(""Yes"" if config.specified else ""No"")); print(""Looking from atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged clockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)). Which prints:; Does this atom have tet stereo info? True; The stereocenter is at atom Id 1; Is the configuration specified? Yes; Looking from atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged clockwise. How do I know that I’m looking from atom Id 0, and that the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”.

As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:8165,config,config,8165,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['config'],['config']

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt.

Independent formats like Format C are also possible.; The Conversion control, which also keeps track of the available formats, the conversion options and the input and output streams. It can be compiled without reference to any other parts of the program. In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities. This depends only on the Conversion control module (obconversion.h is included), but not on the Chemical core or on any of the Formats.; The Fingerprint API, as well as being usable in external programs, is employed by the fastsearch and fingerprint formats.; The Fingerprints, which are bit arrays which describe an object and which facilitate fast searching. They are also built as plugins, registering themselves with their base class OBFingerprint which is in the Fingerprint API.; The Error handling can be used throughout the program to log and display errors and warnings (see below). It is possible to build each box in the diagram as a separate DLL or shared library and the restricted dependencies can help to limit the amount of recompilation. For the formats or the fingerprints built in this way it may be possible to use only those whose DLL or so files are present when the program starts. Several formats or fingerprints may be present in a single dynamic library.; Alternatively, and most commonly, the same source code can be built into a single executable. The restricted dependencies still provide easier program maintenance.; This segregation means that a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows.

The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to release any code that uses the Open Babel library. This is completely untrue. There are no restrictions on use of Open Babel code for personal projects, regardless of where you work (academia, industry, … wherever).; However, if you intend on releasing a software package that uses Open Babel code, the GPL requires that your package be released under the GNU GPL license. The distinction is between use and distribution.

MacOSX and Linux#; On Linux and MacOSX you need to use Mono, the open source implementation of the .NET framework, to compile the bindings. The following instructions describe how to compile and use these bindings:. OBDotNet.dll is included in the Open Babel source distribution in scripts/csharp. To compile a CSharp application that uses this (e.g. the example program shown below), use a command similar to the following:; gmcs example.cs /reference:../openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/csharp/OBDotNet.dll. To run this on MacOSX or Linux you need to compile the CSharp bindings as described in the section Compile language bindings. This creates lib/libopenbabel_csharp.so in the build directory.; Add the location of OBDotNet.dll to the environment variable MONO_PATH. Add the location of libopenbabel_csharp.so to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

These correspond to :obapi:`OBMolAtomIter`, :obapi:`OBMolBondIter`, :obapi:`OBResidueIter` and :obapi:`OBMolAtomDFSIter` respectively.; OBAtom has .Bonds() and .Neighbours().

As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes.

Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version of Babel. But if you like one-word, mixed-case project names, then go for OpenBabel. In that case, the space is just too small to be printed.; How does this relate to the original Babel and OELib, the “next” Babel?; The original Babel was written by Pat Walters and Matt Stahl, based on the “convert” program by Ajay Shah, and is still a remarkable application. Both Pat and Matt have moved on to other work. The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1.

Global variables, global functions and constants in the C++ API can be found in org.openbabel.openbabel_java.

This means that the following foreach loop is possible:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetAtomicNum());; }. To facilitate use of the :obapi:`OBMolAtomBFSIter`, OBAtom has been extended to incorporate a CurrentDepth value, accessible through a get method:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomBFSIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetCurrentDepth());; }. previous; Examples. next; Perl.

The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:.

You need the the Python development libraries to compile the Python bindings (package python-dev in Ubuntu); You need the the Perl development libraries to compile the Perl bindings (package libperl-dev in Ubuntu). Basic build procedure#; The basic build procedure is the same for all platforms and will be described first. After this, we will look at variations for particular platforms. The recommended way to build Open Babel is to use a separate source and build directory; for example, openbabel-2.3.2 and build. The first step is to create these directories:; $ tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz # (this creates openbabel-2.3.2); $ mkdir build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder.

Open Babel’s command line cannot parse tables with custom formats. But the TPSA descriptor, defined by a table in the file psa.txt, is already present and can be used as follows:; obabel -:CN2C(=O)N(C)C(=O)C1=C2N=CN1C -osmi --append TPSA. giving:; Cn1c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c2c1ncn2C 61.82; 1 molecule converted.

It is possible to add new descriptors without having to recompile. If another property, myProp, could be calculated using a table in myprop.txt with the same format as psa.txt, then a descriptor could set up by adding the following item to plugindefines.txt:; OBGroupContrib; myProp # name of descriptor; myprop.txt # data file; Coolness index # brief description.

Every record contains the tags PUBCHEM_CACTVS_HBOND_DONOR, PUBCHEM_CACTVS_HBOND_ACCEPTOR and PUBCHEM_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT, and most of the records contain the tag PUBCHEM_XLOGP3.; The program must create a new SD file which is the same as the input file but with a new tag data field named “RULE5”. This must be “1” if the record passes Lipinski’s rule, “0” if it does not, and “no logP” if the PUBCHEM_XLOGP3 field is missing. This exercise is a bit of a stretch for the Open Babel command-line.

Modifiability,"User Guide; Adding plugins; How to add... How to add a new descriptor#; [Some text here]. Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line between it and other descriptor definitions):; OBGroupContrib; hellohalo # name of descriptor; hellohalo_smarts.txt # data file; Count up the number of halogens (sort of)\n # brief description; This descriptor is not correlated with any\n # longer description; known property, living or dead. Now create a file hellohalo_smarts.txt, again in the working directory, containing the following SMARTS definitions and contribution values:; # These are the SMARTS strings and contribution values; # for the 'hellohalo' group contribution descriptor.; ;heavy; F 1 # This is for fluorines; Cl 2 # And this is for chlorines; Br 3 # Etc.; I 4 # Ditto. That’s it!; Now let’s test it. Open a command prompt, and change directory to the working directory.

Modifiability,"approach was that the user never needed to consider the implicit hydrogens; their count was calculated based on the explicit atoms (a behavior known as “floating valence”). The disadvantage was that it was difficult for the user to specify non-standard valencies, may have papered-over problems with the data, gave rise to subtle bugs which were not easily addressed and had poorer performance.; As an example of how the behavior has changed, let’s look at creating a bond. If we read the SMILES string C.C, create a bond between the two atoms and write out the SMILES string, we get different answers for OB 2.x (CC) versus OB 3.0 ([CH4][CH4]). OB 2.x just works out the count based on standard valence rules. With OB 3.0, there were four implicit hydrogens on each carbon before we made the bond, and there still are four - they didn’t go anywhere and weren’t automatically adjusted.; While this may seem like a major change, adapting code to handle the change should be straightforward: adding or removing a bond should be accompanied by incrementing or decrementing the implicit hydrogen count by the bond order. This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value when decrementing.; unsigned int bondorder = 1;; mol->AddBond(1, 2, bondorder);; OBAtom* start = mol->GetAtom(1);; unsigned int hcount = start->GetImplicitHCount();; start->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);; OBAtom* end = mol->GetAtom(2);; hcount = end->GetImplicitHCount();; end->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);. For the particular case of creating a new atom, it is worth noting that the implicit hydrogen count defaults to zero and that users must set it themselves if necessary. To help with this situation a convenience function has been added to OBAtom that sets the implicit hydrogen count to be consistent with normal valence rules.

Modifiability,"atom Id 1; Is the configuration specified? Yes; Looking from atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged clockwise. How do I know that I’m looking from atom Id 0, and that the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided. For example, you could instead ask for the anticlockwise arrangement of atoms looking towards the atom with Id 0:; configB = tetstereo.GetConfig(0, ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise, ob.OBStereo.ViewTowards); print(""Looking towards atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged anticlockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)). Which prints:; Looking towards atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged anticlockwise. To check whether two Configs represent the same stereo configuration, use the equality operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived.

An excellent summary of 2D; similarity metrics can be found in section 5.3 of the; Daylight Theory Manual. 3D configurationOne of the most important uses of similarity is in the discovery of; new drugs, and a molecule’s shape is critical to it’s medicinal; value (see QSAR).; 3D similarity searches compare the configuration (also called the; “conformation”) of a molecule to other molecules. The “electronic; surface” of the molecule is the important bit - the part that can; interact with other molecules. 3D searches compare the surfaces of; two molecules, and how polarized or polarizable each bit of the; surface is.; 3D similarity searches are uncommon, for two reasons: It’s; difficult and it’s slow.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; with obabel, no such restriction applies.

Look at the SMILES strings for the first and last molecules. If the two molecules are actually the same, why are the two SMILES strings different? (Hint: try using CAN - canonical SMILES instead of SMI.). We can remove duplicates based on the InChI (for example):. Tick the box beside remove duplicates by descriptor and enter inchi as the descriptor. Click CONVERT. Duplicates can be removed based on any of the available descriptors. The full list can be found in the menu under Plugins, descriptors. Are any of the other descriptors useful for removing duplicates?. Filtering by substructure.

Modifiability,"d a new descriptor. Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel.

For example, many quantum mechanics formats (as well as other formats which do not recognize bonds) offer the following options:; -as Call only :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` (single bonds only); -ab No bond perception. Make sure to use generic data classes like :obapi:`OBUnitCell` and others as appropriate. If your format stores any sort of common data types, consider adding a subclass of :obapi:`OBGenericData` for use by other formats and user code.; Please make sure to add several example files to the test set repository. Ideally, these should work several areas of your import code – in the end, the more robust the test set, the more stable and useful Open Babel will be. The test files should include at least one example of a correct file and one example of an invalid file (i.e., something which will properly be ignored and not crash babel).; Make sure to document your format using the string returned by Description(). At the minimum this should include a description of all options, along with examples. However, the more information you add (e.g. unimplemented features, applications of the format, and so forth) the more confident users will be in using it.; That’s it!

It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight. You can see a list of available descriptors using:; obabel -L descriptors. or from a menu item in the GUI. Faster filtering; Open Babel provides a number of utility file formats (see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see Copy raw text (copy)). This copies the content of the molecular file directly from input to output. If you are not converting the molecules between different formats, this procedure is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition, if you are converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive.

Interaction between the atoms and cage points#; Following the calculation of all required atomic properties, the next step in; the calculation of a Spectrophore consists of determining the total; interaction value V(c,p) between each of the atomic contributions of; property p with a set of interaction points on an artificial cage c; surrounding the molecular conformation. Schematic representation of a molecule surrounded by the artifical cage#. For this purpose, each of these; interaction points i on cage c is assigned a value P(c,i); which is either +1 or -1, with the constraint that the sum of all interaction; points on a particular cage should be zero. In a typical Spectrophore; calculation, a cage is represented as a rectangular box encompassing the; molecular conformation in all three dimensions, with the centers of the box; edges being the interaction points. Such a configuration gives twelve; interaction points per cage, and, in the case of a non-stereospecific; distribution of the interaction points, leads to 12 different cages. Although; there are no particular requirements as to the dimensions of the rectangular; cage, the distance between the interaction points and the geometrical extremes; of the molecule should be such that a meaningful interaction value between each; cage point and the molecular entity can be calculated. In this respect, the; default dimensions of the cage are constantly adjusted to enclose the molecule; at a minimum distance of 3 A along all dimensions.

In that case, the space is just too small to be printed.; How does this relate to the original Babel and OELib, the “next” Babel?; The original Babel was written by Pat Walters and Matt Stahl, based on the “convert” program by Ajay Shah, and is still a remarkable application. Both Pat and Matt have moved on to other work. The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to release any code that uses the Open Babel library. This is completely untrue.

The Open Babel API#; The API (Application Programming Interface) is the set of classes, methods and variables that a programming library provides to the user. The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007).

Modifiability,"esent the methyl radical. How Open Babel does it#; Open Babel accepts molecules with explicit or implicit hydrogens and; can convert between the two. It will also handle radicals (and; other hydrogen-deficient species) with implicit hydrogen by using; internally a property of an atom, _spinmultiplicity, modelled on; the RAD property in MDL MOL files and also used in CML. This can be; regarded in the present context as a measure of the hydrogen; deficiency of an atom. Its value is:. 0 for normal atoms,; 2 for radical (missing one hydrogen) and; 1 or 3 for carbenes and nitrenes (missing two hydrogens). It happens that for some doubly deficient species, like carbene; CH2 and oxygen atoms, the singlet and triplet species are fairly close; in energy and both may be significant in certain applications such; as combustion, atmospheric or preparative organic chemistry, so it; is convenient that they can be described separately. There are of; course an infinity of other electronic configurations of molecules; but Open Babel has no special descriptors for them. However, even; more hydrogen-deficient atoms are indicated by the highest possible; value of spinmultiplicity (C atom has spin multiplicity of 5).; (This extends MDL’s RAD property which has a maximum value of 3.); If the spin multiplicity of an atom is not input explicitly, it is; set (in :obapi:`OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity() <OpenBabel::OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity>`) when the input format is; MOL, SMI, CML or Therm. This routine is called after all the atoms; and bonds of the molecule are known. It detects hydrogen deficiency; in an atom and assigns spin multiplicity appropriately. But because; hydrogen may be implicit it only does this for atoms which have at; least one explicit hydrogen or on atoms which have had; :obapi:`ForceNoH() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::ForceNoH>` called for them - which is effectively zero explicit; hydrogens. The latter is used, for instance, when SMILES inputs [O]; to ensure that it is seen a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html:2967,config,configurations,2967,docs/Features/Radicals.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html,1,['config'],['configurations']

Filtering molecules from a multimolecule file#; Six of the options above can be used to filter molecules:. -s - convert molecules that match a SMARTS string; -v - convert molecules that don’t match a SMARTS string; -f and -l - convert molecules in a certain range; --unique - only convert unique molecules (that is, remove duplicates); --filter - convert molecules that meet specified chemical (and other) criteria. This section focuses on the --filter option, which is very versatile and can select a subset of molecules based either on properties imported with the molecule (as from a SDF file) or from calculations made by Open Babel on the molecule.; The aim has been to make the option flexible and intuitive to use; don’t be put off by the long description.; You use it like this:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""MW<130 ROTATABLE_BOND > 2"". It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object).

Modifiability,"guration, use the equality operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data.

Modifiability,"he full list of provided convenience functions is:. run_exec(command), run_exec(stdin, command) - see above; BaseTest.getTestFile(filename) - returns the full path to a testfile; BaseTest.canFindExecutable(executable) - checks whether the executable exists in the expected location; BaseTest.assertConverted(stderr, N) - An assert statement that takes the stderr from run_exec and will check whether the number of molecules reported as converted matches N. Test the API using Python#; The easiest place to add new tests is into test/testbindings.py. Classes are used to organise the tests, but for a single ‘miscellaneous’ test a good place is the TestSuite class. Somewhere in that class add the following function:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; my_molwt = round(pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The variable here is defined in testbindings.py and may be used find the path to testfiles. For example, given the test/ethanol.smi, the following may be used to read it:; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; answers = [46.07, 1.01, 2.01]; testfile = os.path.join(here, ""test"", ""ethanol.smi""); for mol, answer in zip(pybel.readfile(""smi"", testfile), answers):; my_molwt = round(mol.molwt, 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt). The tests use the standard unittest framework. One thing to note, which is not obvious, is how to test for exceptions. A typical case is checking that a dodgy SMILES is rejected on reading; in this instance, Pybel.readstring() will raise an IOError. To assert that this is the case, rather than use try/except, the following syntax is required:; self.assertRaises(IOError, pybel.readstring, ""smi"", ""~*&*($"").

Modifiability,"he molecules with titles 56 123 and 126, which is probably what you wanted.; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""title<'129'"". converts only 123 and 126 because a string comparison is being made.; String comparisons can use * as a wildcard if used as the first or last character of the string (anywhere else a * is a normal character). So --filter ""title='*ol'"" will match molecules with titles ‘methanol’, ‘ethanol’ etc. and --filter ""title='eth*' will match ‘ethanol’, ‘ethyl acetate’, ‘ethical solution’ etc. Use a * at both the first and last characters to test for the occurrence of a string, so --filter ""title='*ol*'"" will match ‘oleum’, ‘polonium’ and ‘ethanol’. SMARTS descriptor#; This descriptor will do a SMARTS test (substructure and more) on the molecules. The smarts ID can be abbreviated to s and the = is optional. More than one SMARTS test can be done:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""s='CN' s!='[N+]'"". This provides a more flexible alternative to the existing -s and -v options, since the SMARTS descriptor test can be combined with other tests. InChI descriptor#; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'"". will convert only ethanol. It uses the default parameters for InChI comparison, so there may be some messages from the InChI code. There is quite a lot of flexibility on how the InChI is presented (you can miss out the non-essential bits):; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi='C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3'""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3""; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""InChI=1/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3"". all have the same effect.; The comparison of the InChI string is done only as far as the parameter’s length. This means that we can take advantage of InChI’s layered structure:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""inchi=C2H6O"". will convert both Ethanol and Dimethyl Ether.

Modifiability,"ibrary; Updating to... Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; with obabel, no such restriction applies. Because of the original design of babel, it is not possible to add this capability in a backwards-compatible way.; obabel has a shortcut for entering SMILES strings. Precede the SMILES by -: and use in place of an input file. The SMILES string should be enclosed in quotation marks. For example:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C"" -ocan. More than one can be used, and a molecule title can be included if enclosed in quotes:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C aspirin"" -:""Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O salicylic acid""; -ofpt. obabel cannot use concatenated single-character options.

Modifiability,"ig objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data.

When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .bin file, it creates a directory jdk1.6.0_21 (or similar); you should set JAVA_HOME to the full path to this directory.; If CMake cannot find the Perl libraries (which happens on Ubuntu 10.10, surprisingly), you need to configure CMake with something like -DPERL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.10 -DPERL_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/perl/5.10.1/CORE.; If you are compiling the CSharp bindings, you should specify the CSharp compiler to use with something like -DCSHARP_EXECUTABLE=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe.; When you run make install, all of the bindings will be installed to the same location as the Open Babel libraries (typically /usr/local/lib).; To prepare to use the bindings, add the install directory to the front of the appropriate environment variable: PYTHONPATH for Python, PERL5LIB for Perl, RUBYLIB for Ruby, CLASSPATH for Java, and MONO_PATH for Mono. For example, for Python:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON; $ make; # make install; $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib:$PYTHONPATH.

Modifiability,"ing is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -aS -osmi; FC(F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br.

Modifiability,"ing; internally a property of an atom, _spinmultiplicity, modelled on; the RAD property in MDL MOL files and also used in CML. This can be; regarded in the present context as a measure of the hydrogen; deficiency of an atom. Its value is:. 0 for normal atoms,; 2 for radical (missing one hydrogen) and; 1 or 3 for carbenes and nitrenes (missing two hydrogens). It happens that for some doubly deficient species, like carbene; CH2 and oxygen atoms, the singlet and triplet species are fairly close; in energy and both may be significant in certain applications such; as combustion, atmospheric or preparative organic chemistry, so it; is convenient that they can be described separately. There are of; course an infinity of other electronic configurations of molecules; but Open Babel has no special descriptors for them. However, even; more hydrogen-deficient atoms are indicated by the highest possible; value of spinmultiplicity (C atom has spin multiplicity of 5).; (This extends MDL’s RAD property which has a maximum value of 3.); If the spin multiplicity of an atom is not input explicitly, it is; set (in :obapi:`OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity() <OpenBabel::OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity>`) when the input format is; MOL, SMI, CML or Therm. This routine is called after all the atoms; and bonds of the molecule are known. It detects hydrogen deficiency; in an atom and assigns spin multiplicity appropriately. But because; hydrogen may be implicit it only does this for atoms which have at; least one explicit hydrogen or on atoms which have had; :obapi:`ForceNoH() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::ForceNoH>` called for them - which is effectively zero explicit; hydrogens. The latter is used, for instance, when SMILES inputs [O]; to ensure that it is seen as an oxygen atom (spin multiplicity=3); rather than water. Otherwise, atoms with no explicit hydrogen are; assumed to have a spin multiplicity of 0, i.e with full complement; of implicit hydrogens.; In deciding which atoms should be have spin mult",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html:3202,extend,extends,3202,docs/Features/Radicals.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html,1,['extend'],['extends']

Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit.

In this setting, small local differences in the fields between; pairs of molecules will be picked up much more easily.; The absolute values of the individual Spectrophore data points are dependent; on the used resolution. Low resolution values lead to small values of the; calculated individual Spectrophore data points, while high resolutions will; lead to larger data values. It is therefore only meaningful to compare only; Spectrophores that have been generated using the same resolution settings or; after some kind of normalization is performed.; Computation time is not influenced by the specified resolution and hence; is identical for all different resolution settings. Stereospecificity#; Some of the cages that are used to calculated Spectrophores have a; stereospecific distribution of the interaction points. The resulting; interaction values resulting from these cages are therefore sensitive to the; enantiomeric configuration of the molecule within the cage. The fact that both; stereoselective as well as stereo non-selective cages can be used makes it; possible to include or exclude stereospecificity in the virtual screening; search. Depending on the desired output, the stereospecificity of; Spectrophores can be specified by the user using the -s option:.

Modifiability,"irst step is to create these directories:; $ tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz # (this creates openbabel-2.3.2); $ mkdir build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work.

It is a useful shorthand in; writing radicals, and in many cases is easier to read since the; emphasis is on the radical centre rather than the number of; hydrogens which is less chemically significant.; In addition, this extension interprets multiple lower case c; without ring closure as a conjugated carbon chain, so that cccc is; input as 1,3-butadiene. Lycopene (the red in tomatoes) is; Cc(C)cCCc(C)cccc(C)cccc(C)ccccc(C)cccc(C)cccc(C)CCcc(C)C (without; the stereochemical specifications). This conjugated chain form is; not used on output - except in the standard SMILES aromatic form,; c1ccccc1 benzene.; It is interesting to note that the lower case extension actually improves; the chemical representation in a few cases. The allyl radical C3H5; would be conventionally [CH2]=[CH][CH2] (in its explict H form),; but could be represented as ccc with the extended syntax. The; latter more accurately represents the symmetry of the molecule; caused by delocalisation.; This extension is not as robust or as carefully considered as standard; SMILES and should be used with restraint. A structure that uses c; as a radical centre close to aromatic carbons can be confusing to; read, and Open Babel’s SMILES parser can also be confused. For example, it; recognizes c1ccccc1c as the benzyl radical, but it doesn’t like; c1cc(c)ccc1. Radical centres should not be involved in ring; closure: for cyclohexyl radical C1cCCCC1 is ok, but c1CCCCC1 is not.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007).

Modifiability,"nd that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can step through and see what’s happening. Running tests#; To begin with, we need to configure CMake to enable tests: -DENABLE_TESTS=ON. This adds the make test target and builds the C++ tests. For tests of type 3 (above), you will also need to enable the Python bindings: -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUN_SWIG=ON. Some tests are dependent on optional dependencies; if you don’t build with support for these, then the corresponding tests will not be run.; To actually run the tests, you can run the entire test suite in one go or run individual tests. To run the entire suite, use make test or ctest (note that you can use the -j option to speed up ctest). The ctest command also allows a single test or a list of tests to be specified, and in combination with -VV (verbose) may be useful to run an individual test. However, I find it more useful to run individual tests directly. Here is an example of how to run an individual test for each of the three types discussed earlier:. test_runner regressionstest 1; This will run test number 1 in regressionstest.cpp. Nothing will happen…unless the ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:2117,config,configure,2117,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,1,['config'],['configure']

Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line between it and other descriptor definitions):; OBGroupContrib; hellohalo # name of descriptor; hellohalo_smarts.txt # data file; Count up the number of halogens (sort of)\n # brief description; This descriptor is not correlated with any\n # longer description; known property, living or dead.

GitHub project page; Development version API documentation; Development version Sphinx documentation. Working with the Development Code#; To download and update the latest version of the Open Babel source code, you need Git. Git is the name of the project used to maintain the Open Babel version control repository. There are many clients for Git, including command-line and GUI applications. Keeping up to date with Git#. Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel. Configure and compile this using CMake (see Compiling Open Babel).; After some time passes, and you want the latest bug fixes or new features, you may want to update your source code. To do this, go into the openbabel-dev directory you created above, and type:; git pull -u. Do step (2) again.; If, after updating, the compilation fails please report it to the Open Babel mailing list. In the meanwhile, if you want to go back to a particular revision (that is, if you don’t want to use the latest one), just use git log to find the checksum of the current revision, and update to an earlier revision using this:. $ git log; …; commit 1c2916cc5e6ed31a23291524b08291c904506c3f; Author: Noel O’Boyle <baoilleach@gmail.com>; Date: Mon Apr 30 07:33:17 2018 +0100; $ git checkout 1c2916cc5.

What’s new from 1.100.2#; This release represents Open Babel’s fourth “birthday” and a milestone for; a stable, flexible interface for developers and users alike. New conversion framework. The new framework allows dynamicloading/unloading of file translator modules (i.e., shared; libraries, DLLs, DSO, etc.). More importantly, it facilitates adding; new formats, since each format is self-contained and no editing of; other files is required. Improved support for XML chemistry formats, including CML, PubChem XML,. Support for fingerprinting and calculation of Tanimoto coefficients forsimilarity consideration.; (A flexible fingerprint framework is available for developers.). New support for Perl and Python “wrappers” of the Open Babel library. Many enhancements to the Open Babel API: See the Developers API Notes formore information. Some code will require updating, see the; Developer’s Migration Guide for details.

Modifiability,"o a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:12127,config,configuration,12127,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"o configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the fir",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:8119,config,config,8119,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['config'],['config']
Modifiability,"ochemical configuration is accessed via a Config() object associated with each StereoData. The contents of this object will be different depending on the specific type of stereochemistry, e.g. OBCisTransStereo::Config (OBCisTransConfig from Python) records the begin and end Ids of the associated bond, the Ids of the attached atoms, the spatial relationship of those atoms, and whether stereo is specified.; Let’s read the SMILES string F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I and access the stereo. When we read this SMILES string, the tetrahedral center will be the second atom, that with Idx 2.:; smi = ""F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I""; mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", smi).OBMol; secondatom = mol.GetAtom(2); atomid = secondatom.GetId(). stereofacade = ob.OBStereoFacade(mol); print(""Does this atom have tet stereo info?"", stereofacade.HasTetrahedralStereo(atomid)); tetstereo = stereofacade.GetTetrahedralStereo(atomid); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); print(""The stereocenter is at atom Id {}"".format(config.center)); print(""Is the configuration specified? {}"".format(""Yes"" if config.specified else ""No"")); print(""Looking from atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged clockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)). Which prints:; Does this atom have tet stereo info? True; The stereocenter is at atom Id 1; Is the configuration specified? Yes; Looking from atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged clockwise. How do I know that I’m looking from atom Id 0, and that the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided. For example, you could instead ask ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:5517,config,configuration,5517,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['config'],['configuration']

The structure of the Open Babel codebase broken down into modules#. The separate parts of the OpenBabel program are:. The Chemical core, which contains OBMol etc. and has all the chemical structure description and manipulation. This bit is the heart of the application and its API can be used as a chemical toolbox. It has no input/output capabilities.; The Formats, which read and write to files of different types. These classes are derived from a common base class, OBFormat, which is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion. This means the formats are plugins - new formats can be added without changing any framework code.; Common Formats include OBMoleculeFormats and XMLBaseFormat from which most other formats (like Format A and Format B in the diagram) are derived. Independent formats like Format C are also possible.; The Conversion control, which also keeps track of the available formats, the conversion options and the input and output streams. It can be compiled without reference to any other parts of the program. In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities. This depends only on the Conversion control module (obconversion.h is included), but not on the Chemical core or on any of the Formats.; The Fingerprint API, as well as being usable in external programs, is employed by the fastsearch and f",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html:4052,plugin,plugins,4052,docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/DevBestPractices.html,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a short test of type (1) so that I can",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:1092,refactor,refactoring,1092,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

To run the resulting Test.class on MacOSX or Linux you first need to compile the Java bindings as described in the section Compile language bindings. This creates lib/libopenbabel_java.so in the build directory.; Add the location of openbabel.jar to the environment variable CLASSPATH, not forgetting to append the location of Test.class (typically “.”):; export CLASSPATH=/home/user/Tools/openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/java/openbabel.jar:. Add the location of libopenbabel_java.so to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

In addition, if it not present, some API classes (OBAlign, OBConformerSearch) and plugins (the QEq and QTPIE charge models, the --conformer and --align operations) will not be available.; Eigen may be available through your package manager (the libeigen2-dev package in Ubuntu). Alternatively, Eigen is available from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. It doesn’t need to be compiled or installed. Just unzip it and specify its location when configuring cmake (see below) using -DEIGEN2_INCLUDE_DIR=whereever or -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=wherever. Cairo development libraries are required to support PNG depiction (the libcairo2-dev package in Ubuntu); If using GCC 3.x to compile (and not GCC 4.x), then the Boost headers are required for certain formats (CML, Chemkin, Chemdraw CDX, MDL RXN and RSMI). If you want to use Open Babel using one of the supported language bindings, then the following notes may apply:.

This binding is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel interfaces from Java, including the base classes :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, :obapi:`OBBond`, and :obapi:`OBResidue`, as well as the conversion framework :obapi:`OBConversion`.; Essentially any call in the C++ API is available to Java programs with very little difference in syntax. As a result, the principal documentation is the Open Babel C++ API documentation. A few differences exist, however:. Global variables, global functions and constants in the C++ API can be found in org.openbabel.openbabel_java. The variables are accessible through get methods.; When accessing various types of :obapi:`OBGenericData`, you will need to cast them to the particular subclass using the global functions, toPairData, toUnitCell, etc.; The Java versions of the iterator classes in the C++ API (that is, all those classes ending in Iter) implement the Iterator and Iterable interfaces. This means that the following foreach loop is possible:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetAtomicNum());; }. To facilitate use of the :obapi:`OBMolAtomBFSIter`, OBAtom has been extended to incorporate a CurrentDepth value, accessible through a get method:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomBFSIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetCurrentDepth());; }. previous; Examples. next; Perl.

To compile a CSharp application that uses this (e.g. the example program shown below), use a command similar to the following:; gmcs example.cs /reference:../openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/csharp/OBDotNet.dll.

From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided.

Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel.

General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class.

Modifiability,"t a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows. So some discipline is needed when adding new code, and sometimes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol files with code from mdlformat. The calling format should not use the code directly but should do it through a OBConversion object configured with the appropriate helper format.; The objects passed between the modules in the diagram above are polymorphic :obapi:`OBBase` pointers. This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code.

Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:7806,config,configure,7806,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,1,['config'],['configure']

The restricted dependencies still provide easier program maintenance.; This segregation means that a module can directly call code only in other modules connected to it by forward arrows. So some discipline is needed when adding new code, and sometimes non-obvious work-arounds are necessary. For instance, since the user interface doesn’t know about the Chemical Core, if it were necessary to set any parameters in it, then this would have to be done through a pseudo format OBAPIInterface.; Sometimes one format needs to use code from another format, for example, rxnformat needs to read mol files with code from mdlformat. The calling format should not use the code directly but should do it through a OBConversion object configured with the appropriate helper format.; The objects passed between the modules in the diagram above are polymorphic :obapi:`OBBase` pointers. This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:.

If you want to use Open Babel using one of the supported language bindings, then the following notes may apply:. You need the the Python development libraries to compile the Python bindings (package python-dev in Ubuntu); You need the the Perl development libraries to compile the Perl bindings (package libperl-dev in Ubuntu). Basic build procedure#; The basic build procedure is the same for all platforms and will be described first. After this, we will look at variations for particular platforms. The recommended way to build Open Babel is to use a separate source and build directory; for example, openbabel-2.3.2 and build. The first step is to create these directories:; $ tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz # (this creates openbabel-2.3.2); $ mkdir build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#.

Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (or newer) compiler.; We use the Visual C++ 2010 (10.0) Express Edition (available for free). Open a command prompt, and change directory to the windows-vc2008 subdirectory. To configure cmake, and generate the VC++ project files, run default_build.bat.; Double-click on windows-vc2008/build/openbabel.sln to start MSVC++. At the top of the window just below the menu bar, choose Release in the drop-down box.; On the left-hand side, right-click on the ALL_BUILD target, and choose Build. Troubleshooting build problems#; CMake caches some variables from run-to-run. How can I wipe the cache to start from scratch?; Delete CMakeCache.txt in the build directory. This is also a very useful file to look into if you have any problems.; How do I specify the location of the XML libraries?; CMake should find these automatically if they are installed system-wide. If you need to specify them, try using the -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=wherever option with CMake to specify the location of the DLL or SO file, and -DLIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR=wherever to specify the location of the header files.; How do I specify the location of the ZLIB libraries?; CMake should find these automatically if they are installed system-wide.

This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:13831,config,configuration,13831,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['config'],['configuration']

The default; options are to show the image on the screen (show=True), not to; write to a file (filename=None), to calculate 2D coordinates; (usecoords=False) but not to store them (update=False).; The addh(); and removeh(); methods allow hydrogens to be added and removed.; If a molecule does not have 3D coordinates, they can be generated; using the make3D(); method. By default, this includes 50 steps of a geometry; optimisation using the MMFF94 forcefield. The list of available; forcefields is stored in the; forcefields; variable. To further optimise the structure, you can use the; localopt(); method, which by default carries out 500 steps of an optimisation; using MMFF94. Note that hydrogens need to be added before calling; localopt().; The calcdesc(); method of a Molecule returns a dictionary containing descriptor; values for LogP, Polar Surface Area (“TPSA”) and Molar Refractivity; (“MR”). A list of the available descriptors is contained in the; variable descs.; If only one or two descriptor values are required, you can specify; the names as follows: calcdesc([""LogP"", ""TPSA""]). Since the; data attribute of a Molecule is also a dictionary, you can; easily add the result of calcdesc() to an SD file (for example); as follows:; mol = next(readfile(""sdf"", ""without_desc.sdf"")); descvalues = mol.calcdesc(); # In Python, the update method of a dictionary allows you; # to add the contents of one dictionary to another; mol.data.update(descvalues); output = Outputfile(""sdf"", ""with_desc.sdf""); output.write(mol); output.close(). For convenience, a Molecule provides an iterator over its Atoms.; This is used as follows:; for atom in myMolecule:; # do something with atom. Atoms have the following attributes: atomicmass, atomicnum,; coords, exactmass, formalcharge, heavyvalence,; heterovalence, hyb, idx, implicitvalence, isotope,; partialcharge, spin, type, valence, vector.

Modifiability,"w operations and options#; The babel command line has the form:; babel inputfile [outputfile] [options]. There are several types of options:. Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option. This is a plugin class, which means that new ops are easily added without a need to alter any existing code.; The ops that are installed can be found using:; babel -L ops. or in the plugins menu item in the GUI. An example is the --gen3D option, which adds 3D coordinates to a molecule:; 1 class OpGen3D : public OBOp; 2 {; 3 public:; 4 OpGen3D(const char* ID) : OBOp(ID, false){};; 5 const char* Description(){ return ""Generate 3D coordinates""; }; 6; 7 virtual bool WorksWith(OBBase* pOb)const; 8 { return dynamic_cast<OBMol*>(pOb)!=NULL; }; 9 virtual bool Do(OBBase* pOb, OpMap* pmap, const char* OptionText);; 10 };; 11; 12 OpGen3D theOpGen3D(""gen3D"");; 13; 14 bool OpGen3D::Do(OBBase* pOb, OpMap* pmap, const char* OptionText); 15 {; 16 OBMol* pmol = dynamic_cast<OBMol*>(pOb);; 17 if(!pmol); 18 return false;; 19; 20 OBBuilder builder;; 21 builder.Build(*pmol);; 22 pmol->SetDimension(3);; 23; 24 return true;; 25 }.

Modifiability,"y operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); config = tetstereo.GetConfig(); config.winding = ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). config.specified = False; tetstereo.SetConfig(config); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). which prints:; C[C@@H](Cl)F; C[C@H](Cl)F; CC(Cl)F. How did I know that setting the relative arrangement to anti-clockwise would invert the stereo? Again, as described above, by default GetConfig() returns the atoms in clockwise order. Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data.

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a sh",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:819,plugin,plugins,819,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

Adding new operations and options#; The babel command line has the form:; babel inputfile [outputfile] [options]. There are several types of options:. Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html:10,plugin,plugins,10,docs/WritePlugins/index.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html,3,['plugin'],['plugins']

The following examples show how this is done. File conversion#; Let’s convert a PDB file to MOL format:. Create a folder on the Desktop called Work; Download the PDB file for insulin (4ins) from the Protein Data Bank and save it in the Work folder; Set the input file format to PDB and the input filename to the downloaded PDB file. Set the output file format to MOL and the output filename to file:4ins.mol in the Work folder. Now click CONVERT. Converting without files#; Rather than use input and output files, it is possible to paste the contents of a chemical file format into the input box, and see the results of the conversion in the output box.; Here we will try this with the SMILES format, and illustrate how stereochemistry is handled by SMILES:.

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html:815,plugin,plugins,815,docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

General#; What is Open Babel?; Put simply, Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and many related areas.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:808,plugin,plugins,808,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J.

They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:.

Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem.

Goals of the Open Babel project#; Open Babel is a project to facilitate the interconversion of chemical data from one format to another – including file formats of various types. This is important for the following reasons:. Multiple programs are often required in realistic workflows. These may include databases, modeling or computational programs, visualization programs, etc.; Many programs have individual data formats, and/or support only a small subset of other file types.; Chemical representations often vary considerably:. Some programs are 2D. Some are 3D. Some use fractional k-space coordinates.; Some programs use bonds and atoms of discrete types. Others use only atoms and electrons.; Some programs use symmetric representations. Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others.

User Guide; Handling of... Handling of aromaticity#; The purpose of this section is to give an overview of how Open Babel handles aromaticity. Given that atoms can be aromatic, bonds can be aromatic, and that molecules have a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions.

Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html:740,plugin,plugins,740,docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,2,['plugin'],['plugins']

How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html:741,plugin,plugins,741,docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,2,['plugin'],['plugins']

We provide two Python modules that can be used to access the functionality of Open Babel toolkit:. The openbabel module:. This contains the standard Python bindings automatically generated using SWIG from the C++ API. See The openbabel module. The Pybel module:. This is a light-weight wrapper around the classes and methods in the openbabel module. Pybel provides more convenient and Pythonic ways to access the Open Babel toolkit. See Pybel.

The most common type of fingerprint is a series of binary digits (bits) that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing fingerprints allows you to determine the similarity between two molecules, to find matches to a query substructure, etc.; Open Babel provides several fingerprints of different types:. Fingerprint format: the path-based fingerprint FP2; substructure based fingerprints FP3, FP4 and MACCS; user-defined substructures; Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA) (mna): a circular fingerprint; MolPrint2D format (mpd): a circular fingerprint; Spectrophores™: a fingerprint that encodes the 3D structure of a molecule.

Pybel#; Pybel provides convenience functions and classes that make it; simpler to use the Open Babel libraries from Python, especially for; file input/output and for accessing the attributes of atoms and; molecules. The Atom and Molecule classes used by Pybel can be; converted to and from the OBAtom and OBMol used by the; openbabel module. These features are discussed in more detail; below.; The rationale and technical details behind Pybel are described in O’Boyle et al [omh2008]. To support further development of Pybel, please cite this paper if you use Pybel to obtain results for publication.; Information on the Pybel API can be found at the interactive Python; prompt using the help() function. The full API is also listed in; the next section (see Pybel API).; To use Pybel, use from openbabel import pybel. [omh2008]; N.M. O’Boyle, C. Morley and G.R.

User Guide; Stereochemistry. Stereochemistry#; Open Babel stores stereochemistry as the relative arrangement of a set of atoms in space. For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”).

Without indexing, they might wait until you ask for; “John Hartford Bluegrass”, then start searching the web, and in a; year or two find all the web pages about the deceased banjo/fiddle; player and steamboat captain. That would probably not impress you.; Instead, these search engines search the web before you ask your; question, and build an index of the words they find. When you; type in “Bluegrass John Hartford”, they already know all of the; pages that have “John”, all of the pages with “Hartford”, and all; of the pages with “Bluegrass”.

This binding is generated using the SWIG; package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel; interfaces via Python, including the base classes OBMol, OBAtom,; OBBond, and OBResidue, as well as the conversion framework; OBConversion. As such, essentially any call in the C++ API is; available to Python scripts with very little difference in syntax.; As a result, the principal documentation is the; C++ API documentation. Examples#; Here we give some examples of common Python syntax for the; openbabel module and pointers to the appropriate sections of; the API documentation.; The example script below creates atoms and bonds one-by-one using; the; :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, and :obapi:`OBBond` classes.; from openbabel import openbabel. mol = openbabel.OBMol(); print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 0 (atoms).

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:857,plugin,plugins,857,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

Using this library, you can write your own custom scripts and software for yourself or others. Note; Any software that uses the Open Babel library must abide by terms of the GNU Public License version 2. This includes all of the supporting language bindings (for example, Python scripts) as well as C++ programs. To summarise, if you are considering distributing your software to other people, you must make your source code available to them on request. Open Babel is a C++ library and can easily be used from C++. In addition it can be accessed from Python, Perl, Ruby, CSharp and Java. These are referred to as language bindings (the Python bindings, etc.) and they were automatically generated from the C++ library using SWIG. For Python we also provide a module (Pybel) that makes it easier to access features of the bindings.

User Guide; obabel vs... obabel vs Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta#; The Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta is the brainchild of Andrew Dalke. It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used. Also the copy output format at present works only for files with Unix line endings. Heavy atom counts from an SD file#.

Performance," Because of the original design of babel, it is not possible to add this capability in a backwards-compatible way.; obabel has a shortcut for entering SMILES strings. Precede the SMILES by -: and use in place of an input file. The SMILES string should be enclosed in quotation marks. For example:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C"" -ocan. More than one can be used, and a molecule title can be included if enclosed in quotes:; obabel -:""O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C aspirin"" -:""Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O salicylic acid""; -ofpt. obabel cannot use concatenated single-character options.

While more verbose, the new arrangement is in line with standard practice and helps avoid conflict with a different Python project, PyBEL. Handling of elements and related information#; The API for interconverting atomic numbers and element symbols has been replaced for performance reasons. The OBElementTable class has been removed and its associated functions are now available through the OBElements namespace:; // OB 2.x; OBElementTable etab;; const char *elem = etab.GetSymbol(6);; unsigned int atomic_num = etab.GetAtomicNum(elem);. // OB 3.0; #include <openbabel/elements.h>; const char *elem = OBElements::GetSymbol(6);; unsigned int atomic_num = OBElements::GetAtomicNum(elem);. Furthermore, the OBAtom API convenience functions for testing for particular elements (e.g. IsHydrogen()) have been removed. Instead, OBAtom::GetAtomicNum() should be used along with an element constant or atomic number:; // OB 2.x; if (atom->IsCarbon()) {... // OB 3.0; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == OBElements.Carbon) {...; // or; if (atom->GetAtomicNum() == 6) {...

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; wi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:1260,perform,performance,1260,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,1,['perform'],['performance']

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel. Remember that if you do add a new plugin, please contribute the code back to the Open Babel project. How to add a new file format; Adding new operations and options; The OBOp class.

The structure of the Open Babel codebase broken down into modules#. The separate parts of the OpenBabel program are:. The Chemical core, which contains OBMol etc. and has all the chemical structure description and manipulation. This bit is the heart of the application and its API can be used as a chemical toolbox. It has no input/output capabilities.; The Formats, which read and write to files of different types. These classes are derived from a common base class, OBFormat, which is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion. This means the formats are plugins - new formats can be added without changing any framework code.; Common Formats include OBMoleculeFormats and XMLBaseFormat from which most other formats (like Format A and Format B in the diagram) are derived. Independent formats like Format C are also possible.; The Conversion control, which also keeps track of the available formats, the conversion options and the input and output streams. It can be compiled without reference to any other parts of the program. In particular, it knows nothing of the Chemical core: mol.h is not included.; The User interface, which may be a command line (in main.cpp), a Graphical User Interface(GUI), especially suited to Windows users and novices, or may be part of another program which uses OpenBabel’s input and output facilities.

Substructure and similarity searching a large dataset#; Open Babel provides a format called the fs -- fastsearch index which should be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified. Click CONVERT. We can going to use the following structure for substructure and similarity searching. It can be represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc(N)cc1. How the search works; Behind the scenes, the FastSearch index simply stores a path-based; binary fingerprint for each molecule. When used to search, similarity; is measured based on the Tanimoto coefficient.

Performance,") is an example of what mathematicians call; graph isomorphism,; and is in a class of problems called; NP Complete.; Roughly speaking, this means the time it takes to do a substructure; search is non-polynomial, i.e. exponential in the number of atoms; and bonds. To see why this is a computational disaster, compare two; tasks, one that takes polynomial time,; k1*N2, versus one that takes exponential; time k2*2N. Our polynomial task is bad; enough: If we double N, it takes four times as long to solve. But; the exponential task is worse:; Every time we add an atom it doubles. So going from one atom to; two doubles the time, and going from 100 atoms to 101 atoms doubles; the time. Even if we can get k2 down to a millionth of; k1, we’re still in trouble - a million is just; 220 or twenty atoms away.; It has been mathematically proven that substructure searching is in; the set of NP Complete problems, so there’s no point wasting our; time searching for a polynomial algorithm. The good news is that; most molecules have “low connectivity”, meaning most atoms have; fewer than four bonds, unlike the weird and twisted graphs that; mathematicians consider. In practice, most substructure matching; can be done in polynomial time around N2 or; N3. But even with this improvement, substructure; matching is an “expensive” time-consuming task for a computer.; The key point is that indexing is particularly important for; cheminformatics systems. The typical modern computer can only; examine a few thousand molecules per second, so examining millions; of molecules one-by-one is out of the question. The indexing done; by a modern cheminformatics system is the key to its performance. previous; Representing Molecules. next; Molecular Similarity. On this page; .

Some experiments and most theoretical calculations show significant; pyramidal “puckering” at nitrogens in isolated structures.

This provides a better; match to the time-average molecular geometry in solution or crystal; structures.; If you are comparing force-field optimized molecules to crystal; structure geometries, we recommend using the MMFF94s variant for this; reason. All other parameters are identical.; However, if you are perfoming “docking” simulations, consideration of; active solution conformations, or other types of computational; studies, we recommend using the MMFF94 variant, since one form or; another of the N geometry will predominate.

OBBitVec::BitIsSet() should be used instead. Handling of implicit hydrogens#; With OB 3.0, the number of implicit hydrogens is stored as a property of the atom. This value can be interrogated and set independently of any other property of the atom. This is how other mature cheminformatics toolkits handle implicit hydrogens. In contrast, in OB 2.x this was a derived property worked out from valence rules and some additional flags set on an atom to indicate non-standard valency.; From the point of view of the user, the advantage of the 2.x approach was that the user never needed to consider the implicit hydrogens; their count was calculated based on the explicit atoms (a behavior known as “floating valence”). The disadvantage was that it was difficult for the user to specify non-standard valencies, may have papered-over problems with the data, gave rise to subtle bugs which were not easily addressed and had poorer performance.; As an example of how the behavior has changed, let’s look at creating a bond. If we read the SMILES string C.C, create a bond between the two atoms and write out the SMILES string, we get different answers for OB 2.x (CC) versus OB 3.0 ([CH4][CH4]). OB 2.x just works out the count based on standard valence rules. With OB 3.0, there were four implicit hydrogens on each carbon before we made the bond, and there still are four - they didn’t go anywhere and weren’t automatically adjusted.; While this may seem like a major change, adapting code to handle the change should be straightforward: adding or removing a bond should be accompanied by incrementing or decrementing the implicit hydrogen count by the bond order. This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:6971,perform,performance,6971,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins; How to add... How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` at the end. This will ensure that perception routines do not run while you read in a molecule and are reset after your code finishes (see Lazy Evaluation).; Currently, lazy perception does not include connectivity and bond order assignment. If your format does not include bonds, make sure to call :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` and :obapi:`OBMol::PerceiveBondOrders() <OpenBabel::OBMol::PerceiveBondOrders>` after :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` to ensure bonds are assigned.; Consider various input and output options that users can set from the command-line or GUI. For example, many quantum mechanics formats (as well as other formats which do not recognize bonds) offer the following options:; -as Call only :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` (single bonds only); -ab No bond perception.

Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer. Although labelled as “Conformer Searching”, if you choose the genetic algorithm method (which is the default) then you can save the conformers in the final generation using --writeconformers. For example, the following line creates 30 conformers optimized for RMSD diversity:; obabel startingConformer.mol -O ga_conformers.sdf --conformer --nconf 30; --score rmsd --writeconformers. In this case --score rmsd was not strictly necessary as RMSD diversity was the default in any case. Confab#; Confab systematically generates all diverse low-energy conformers for molecules. To run Confab use the --confab operation, and to assess the results by calculating RMSDs to reference structures, use the confabreport output format.; confab operator. obabel <inputfile> -O <outputfile> --confab [confab options] for typical usage; obabel -L confab for help text.

Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007).

Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization. The available forcefields as listed as follows:; C:\>obabel -L forcefields; GAFF General Amber Force Field (GAFF).; Ghemical Ghemical force field.; MMFF94 MMFF94 force field.; MMFF94s MMFF94s force field.; UFF Universal Force Field. To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-bonded pairs (default = 10).

Performance,"fic Spectrophores are really critical. However, for the vast; majority of virtual screening applications, this increased accuracy is not; required as long as it is not the intention to draw conclusions about; differences in the underlying molecular stereoselectivity. Non-stereospecific; Spectrophores will therefore suffice for most applications. Normalisation#; It may sometimes be desired to focus on the relative differences between the; Spectrophore data points rather than focussing on the absolute differences.; In these cases, normalization of Spectrophores may be required. The current; implementation offers with the -n option the possibility to normalize in four; different ways:. No normalization (default); Normalization towards zero mean; Normalization towards standard deviation; Normalization towards zero mean and unit standard deviation. In all these cases, normalization is performed on a ‘per-property’ basis, which; means that the data points belonging to the same property set are treated as a; single set and that normalization is only performed on the data points within; each of these sets and not across all data points.; Normalization may be important when comparing the Spectrophores of charged; molecules with those of neutral molecules. For molecules carrying a global; positive charge, the resulting Spectrophore data points of the charge and; electrophilicity properties will both be shifted in absolute value compared to; the corresponding data points of the respective neutral species. Normalization; of the Spectrophores removes the original magnitude differences for the data; points corresponding to the charge and electrophilicity properties of charged; and neutral species. Therefore, if the emphasis of the virtual screening; consists of the identification of molecules with similar property fields without; taking into account differences in absolute charge, then Spectrophores; should be normalized towards zero mean. However, if absolute charge differences; ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/spectrophore.html:14922,perform,performed,14922,docs/Fingerprints/spectrophore.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/spectrophore.html,2,['perform'],['performed']
Performance,"he SDF input file. The values of these are added to the title of the molecule. For input files with many molecules these additions are specific to each molecule. (Note that the related option --addtotitle simply adds the same text to every title.); The append option only takes one parameter, which means that it may be necessary to enclose all of the descriptor IDs or property names together in a single set of quotes.; If the name of the property in the SDF file (internally the Attribute in OBPairData) contains spaces, these spaces should be replaced by underscore characters, ‘_’. So the example above would also work for a property named CAT NO.; By default, the extra items are added to the title separated by spaces. But if the first character in the parameter is a punctuation character other than ‘_’, it is used as the separator instead. If the list starts with “t”, a tab character is used as a separator. Generating conformers for structures#; The command line option --conformer allows performing conformer; searches using a range of different algorithms and options:. --log - output a log of the energies (default = no log); --nconf # - number of conformers to generate. Forcefield-based methods for finding stable conformers:. --systematic - systematically (exhaustively) generate all conformers; --random - randomly generate conformers; --weighted - weighted rotor search for lowest energy conformer; --ff <name> - select a forcefield (default = MMFF94). Genetic algorithm based methods (default):. --children # - number of children to generate for each parent (default = 5); --mutability # - mutation frequency (default = 5); --converge # - number of identical generations before convergence is reached; --score # - scoring function [rmsd|energy] (default = rmsd). You can use them like this (to generate 50 conformers, scoring with; MMFF94 energies but default genetic algorithm options):; obabel EtOT5D.cml -O EtOT5D0.xyz --conformer --nconf 50 --score energy. or if you also wish",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:14218,perform,performing,14218,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,1,['perform'],['performing']

User Guide; 3D Structure Generation; Generate a... Generate a single conformer#; There are several steps involved in generating a low-energy conformer from a 0D or 2D structure. OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J. Cheminf.* (2019) **11**, Art. 49.<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5>. Please cite this paper if you use the coordinate generation features in Open Babel.; The functionality of OBBuilder is not directly available through obabel but it is used as the necessary first step of the Gen3D operation discussed below. Conformer searching#; Given a 3D structure, the goal of conformer searching is to find a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html:1650,optimiz,optimization,1650,docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; IC=CC[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -as -osmi; IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F. As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:10765,perform,performed,10765,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,1,['perform'],['performed']
