Deployability,"Goal was to get WGS coverage collection at 100bp at ~15 cents per sample. Since this is I/O bound (takes ~2 hours to stream or localize a BAM, or about the same to decompress a CRAM), cost reduction can be most easily achieved by reducing the memory requirements and moving down to a cheaper VM. . Memory requirements at 100bp are dominated by manipulations of the list of ~30M intervals. There were a few easy fixes to reduce requirements that did not require changing the collection method (which can be easily modified for future investigations, see #4551):. -removed WellformedReadFilter. See #5233. EDIT: We decided after PR review to retain this filter by default and disable it at the WDL level when Best Practices is released. Leaving the issue open.; -initialized HashMultiSet capacity; -removed unnecessary call to OverlapDetector.getAll; -avoided a redundant defensive copy in SimpleCountCollection; -used per-contig OverlapDetectors, rather than a global one. This brought the cost down to ~9 cents per sample using n1-standard-2's with 7.5GB of memory when collecting on BAMs with NIO. Note that I didn't optimize disk size, which accounts for ~50% of the total cost and is unused when running with NIO, so we are closer to ~5 cents per sample. It is possible that using CRAMs with or without NIO and with or without SSDs might be cheaper. Note that OverlapDetectors may be overkill for our case, since bins are guaranteed to be sorted and non-overlapping and queries are also sorted. We could probably roll something that is O(1) in memory. However, since we are I/O bound, as long as we are satisfied with the current cost, I am willing to sacrifice memory for implementation and maintenance costs, as well as the option to change strategies easily. In any case, @lbergelson found some easy wins in OverlapDetector that may further bring the memory usage down, and will issue a fix in htsjdk soon.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5715:725,release,released,725,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5715,1,['release'],['released']

We have already launched our own open source implementation of this protocol, which you can use to access your reads data. Many popular tools such as samtools and htslib have been updated by the community to support htsget. Documentation is provided here.

Deployability,"Hello @bharathramh thank you for your question. We just recently merged the bulk of the code for DRAGEN-GATK (#6634) which means that we are slated to release the DRAGEN-GATK for the next release of GATK. When that happens we will also be releasing an official wdl workflow to use all the new features together. . As for STR variants, one of the code improvements in the new genotyping engine is to better model STR errors by performing a per-sample pre-processing step where a table of empirically generated STR priors is generated by the tools `ComposeSTRTableFile` and `CallibrateDragstrModel`. These work by modifying the priors for genotying to be more in line with the sample PCR/Sequencing errors and can't really be thought of as a feature to ""find STRs"" (except `ComposeSTRTableFile` which is used to find STRs in the reference). These will be featured in the published wdls with appropriate commands. . I would recommend in the future that you direct questions like this one to our forums since this ticket tracker is used to track bugs/ongoing development on the GATK and our Comms Team is better equipped to answer questions there: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/topics",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6912#issuecomment-716747266:151,release,release,151,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6912#issuecomment-716747266,2,['release'],['release']

For calling short germline variants, you could evaluate precision and recall using one of the NIST samples (i.e. HG002) and for calling short somatic variants you could use the SEQC2 tumor-normal pair. . I would like to see how new releases of GATK and how your recommendations/best practices impact precision and recall against a known truth set. This transparency would help anyone using your tools decide if it's worth upgrading to a new release of GATK, or if their implementation of your recommended set of best practices is performing as expected. . If this information could be added to the best practices pages, a relevant tutorial, or a new section of the documentation (containing hap.py/som.py benchmarking information and run times for a set of tested tools and/or workflows), that would be great!.

Deployability,"Hello, sorry you're having this problem. I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. It sounds like it's a corrupted .gz file. You said these were created by HaplotypeCaller and then CombineGvcfs? I have a few questions and suggestions. 1. Were there any other steps in the pipeline that touch the vcfs?; 2. Are you sure the combine stage completed without error? This could potentially be caused by a failure in the step beforehand that silently truncates a file.; 2. Did you run all steps of the pipeline with --use-jdk-deflater & --use-jdk-inflate or just the final one that crashes?; 3. Can you try running PrintBGZFBlockInformation on the file and see what the output of that says?; 4. Is it reproducible on a small file you could share with us?; 5.

Deployability,"Hello,. I am trying to use gatk/4.1.4.1 and picard/2.22.0 to do joint variant calling of PacBio HiFi reads and Illumina short-reads. ; My pipeline is basically the recommended one (without base recalibration) where after HaplotypeCaller, I use GenomicsDBImport and GenotypeGVCFs and end up with the vcf file. The HiFI reads have normal hifi phred scores up to 93 and the illumina are encoded with phred33 quality scores. The output of the joint variant calling is strange and it causes issues when I try to use it with tools like plink and it makes me wonder if the joint variant calling went badly as well. This is even after variant filtration where I filter for QUAL<30 and QD<2. Here is an example of what the first few lines of my vcf calls look like.

Deployability,"Hello,. I'm trying to use the CNVGermline Pipeline with Nextflow and a GATK Singularity image pulled from your Docker image. . As you can see, I'm trying to run the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy with 57 samples, and I got a permission error within my Singularity container. This error is directly related to Singularity permissions to create a directory ('/root/.theano/compiledir_Linux-4.10--generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid-x86_64-3.6.2-64'), because it's running fine with Singularity when I'm root and Docker (without root). So it's not really a GATK4 problem but more a singularity-GATK4 related problem. Maybe your GATK4 Germline CNV calling pipeline is not designed to work as a Singularity container (which is quite understandable), because for tools like HaplotypeCaller, MarkDuplicates ... It's working fine. I didn't know where to post this error, singularity or GATK github, so why not both ! . Do you have any idea make it run properly ?

Indeed, I observed the described differences in the ON_BAIT_BASES/ON_TARGET_BASES metrics:. > ON_BAIT_BASES 1733719583; ON_TARGET_BASES 1274990601. which was reflected in the PCT_SELECTED_BASES (Fraction of bases from reads passing the filters located on or near a baited region):; > PCT_SELECTED_BASES 0.690911.

Deployability,"Hello,. There was at least one prior conversation about migrating or not migrating GATK3 CombineVariants to GATK4. My understanding is that there was a decision in GATK not to migrate CombineVariants, and instead push people to use Picard MergeVcfs. As you know, Picard MergeVcfs is somewhat similar; however, it doesnt merge genotypes. That is a pretty big difference in function. . CombineVariants is one of the few GATK3 tools my lab is still using. I'd like to move us off GATK3 in the coming months. Given GATK has already decided not to migrate it, I would first like to propose that we could port and take it over in my lab's DISCVRseq project (https://github.com/bimberlab/discvrseq). I'm happy to give attribution to GATK, etc. I would likely rename it MergeVcfsAndGenotypes (this is more intuitive to me), but I would otherwise not change functionality much. I'd prefer to do this instead of porting to GATK4 because porting to GATK is going to throw up a lot more obstacles and probably require that I modernize/update a good amount of that tool's code. I appreciate why this is required, but it takes a lot more work from us. If you did not like this, I'm open to considering porting to GATK4. In my initial review, it looked like CombineVariants was fairly self-contained and that most of the accessory code (merging genotypes is the most complex thing) was already migrated to GATK4. Some of you may have already done a more thorough review of it. .

Deployability,"Hello,. To our thinking, one of the compelling reasons to use GenomicsDB over Combined gVCFs is that ability to incrementally append samples, and this is supported through --genomicsdb-update-workspace-path. However, you docs state: ""It is recommended that users backup existing genomicsdb workspaces before adding new samples using --genomicsdb-update-workspace-path. If the tool fails during incremental import for any reason, the workspace may be in an inconsistent/corrupted state"". These files are not small. Given that recommendation, wouldnt it make just as much sense to let the user specify the workspace-to-update, the input gVCFs, and specify an alternate output path where the merged data is written? To us, the key feature is incremental sample append, not update-in-place. Is the user wanted to update the original copy, after successful completion of GenomicsDB they could certainly delete the original and move the new copy into that location? Not to mention, in theory one could have some job trying to read the original workspace, which might get hosed if some other job is trying to edit that workspace in place.

Deployability,"Here is a recap of what we discussed today during the CNV meeting:. For the first round of evaluations we decided to run Germline CNV pipeline on TCGA exomes using a range of key hyperparameters (namely psi-t-scale and p-alt) and establish the base level performance metrics using output of GenomeSTRiP on matched WGS samples as ground truth. . @mbabadi could you come up with a good range of hyperparameter values that you think should be cross-validated?. In particular we need to:. - Dockerize tools we will be evaluating against (XHMM, CODEX2, CLAMMS, GenomeSTRiP); - Write a WDL that runs Germline CNV that scatters across range of key hyperparameters and outputs array of VCFs; - Write VCF processors for output of CLAMMS and CODEX2 ; - Write WDLs for running XHMM, CODEX2, CLAMMS and GenomeSTRiP that output VCFs; - Write WDL that takes results of the above and uses @mbabadi 's gCNV evaluation python modules(located here /dsde/working/mehrtash/gCNV_theano_eval) to output performance metrics; - Decide on an automatic evaluation framework. For the next round of evaluations we need to:. - Decide on appropriate metrics for evaluating performance on trios and write scripts that implement them; - Expand the range of hyperparameters in search space (possibly include different bin sizes, GC vs no GC correction, and fragment mid point coverage collection vs largest fragment overlap coverage collection); - Use gnomAD subset of matched WES/WGS pairs for validation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-362075071:134,pipeline,pipeline,134,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-362075071,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Looks like restructuring of the default repository under conda took out some of these packages and they are no longer directly accessible. They can be accessed from the forge repo with certain flags. This issue seems to deprecate some of the older but still usable versions of GATK (due to various reasons).

Deployability,"Hi @LiviaMoura ,. The dropped allele is expected behavior. One of the ways reblocking speeds up joint genotyping is by dropping information associated with alleles that are not in the most likely genotype. The subsequent alleles are not left aligned because the position doesn't change. Instead they are trimmed so that they use the minimal representation. Historically the FORMAT DP doesn't change when alleles are dropped (as in subsetting more than 5 alternate alleles in the previous pipeline). Given that this is a GVCF with a <NON_REF> allele, the most correct thing to do would be to move that 1 read associated with the dropped allele to the <NON_REF> AD so that the sum of the AD values are still equal to the FORMAT DP, but the NON-REF AD values will get dropped in the joint genotyping step anyway, so the change would only be reflected in the intermediate GVCF files. The DRAGEN data I had been working with didn't have allele fraction, but we also came across this issue independently. I made a fix and we're testing it now. If it looks good, I'll generalize it to use the header information rather than special casing particular annotations. I can put in some code to subset the posteriors as well.

Deployability,Hi @Nanderson246 ; This is a known issue that requires us to update the conda environment and its dependencies on our end which all rely on older versions of certain R and python tools. Direct intervention and changing this code breaks certain unit tests which result in failure to build our conda and docker environments.

Deployability,Hi @RWilton i'm sorry to hear that. I suspect its unrelated given how simple this PR is but its quite possible that filter has been broken since evidently nobody was able to use and adjust it for a long time. This is the logic here that the filter uses:; `return read.isPaired() && !read.isUnmapped() && !read.mateIsUnmapped() &&; (Math.abs(read.getStart() - read.getMateStart()) >= mateTooDistantLength || !read.getContig().equals(read.getMateContig()));`. That logic is correct for what the filter is doing. It should be noted that the filter does the opposite of what you expect it to (since its intended for our SV pipeline) in that it filters out all reads that are NOT having distant mates. This means if you try to run HaplotypeCaller with this setting you will be throwing away every read pair EXCEPT the distant ones which results in mostly no reads. We should perhaps rename this filter to be a little less confusing.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098:619,pipeline,pipeline,619,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @Tintest,. Thanks for checking out GermlineCNVCaller! That is indeed a large cohort. The theano computational graph that represents the probabilistic model will be quite large and may require more memory than you have to successfully compile. We typically select a training cohort (perhaps 100-200 samples) to train the denoising model; ideally, all of your samples are from the same batch, but if not, you may want to train separate cohorts for each batch. These trained models can then be used to call subsequent samples in case mode using the appropriate model for each batch. Another strategy we use is to scatter gCNV runs across the exome/genome. I'd recommend including at least 10,000 intervals in each scatter shard, but you may be able to get away with more. I'd recommend studying the WDL at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/cnv_wdl/germline to see how we typically run the pipeline. @sooheelee is also working on a tutorial that will hopefully provide a useful hands-on example of running the workflow in this manner.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5053#issuecomment-407736504:914,pipeline,pipeline,914,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5053#issuecomment-407736504,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Hi @Vzzarr ,. Thank you for reporting this. I've never heard of this happening before, but I suspect the difference is that you are using maven and we've only ever used gradle. @magicDGS @LeeTL1220 You both build downstream projects, have you ever seen this?. From what I can tell `com.github.fommil.netlib.all` is a POM only dependency, but it's not annotated as such in our generated POM. Gradle resolves it correctly, and then resolves it's transitive dependencies correctly, but maven seems to resolve it differently. . I've reproduced the issue locally, and it seems like it can be fixed by changing this line in our build file:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/62e339fb9150db19f80d4b48aed8d47608461690/build.gradle#L220. to specify the exact dependencies we want instead of using the all artifact. I'll open a pull request with that. There's an additional catch though, you're using the latest release to maven central, which is actually a very old version. We haven't been able to release newer versions to central because they depend on a snapshot of a fork of a google library that isn't released to central. We publish these to our artifactory server which can be resolved like any other maven repository. Would you be able to work with an artifactory dependency? If you can you can A) use the newer and better gatk, B) I won't have to backport this change on top of beta.2 . We're going to fix the problem of not being in central eventually ( certainly before 4.0 release... ) but until then resolving from our artifactory is probably the best bet.

Deployability,Hi @Wangchangsh ; Yes there is an update for this issue. We were able to recreate this problem in our hands and looks like there is a memory management issue somewhere in the GenomicsDB related code inside GenotypeGVCFs. . Our temporary solution until we make an updated release would be to convert imported genomicsDB instances to GVCF using . `gatk SelectVariants -V gendb://instancename -O GVCF_export.g.vcf.gz -R ref.fa -L whateverintervalusedinGDBimport`. and later using this GVCF file as input for the GenotypeGVCFs tool. This ensures that memory usage won't go above unreasonable levels and won't cause any appearant leaks. . I hope this helps.

We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. .

If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. . David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context. Let us know if this is an option you'd like to explore; we'd be happy to help.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-403101973:229,integrat,integrating,229,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-403101973,4,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integrating', 'integration']"
Deployability,"Hi @aderzelle. Thanks for your interest in NeuralNetInference. The tool currently has pre-beta`Experimental` status, so for now it should be used for evaluation purposes only. We expect to release another version of GATK, probably within the next week, that will include an updated version of the tool that will include a default architecture file, along with some additional tools for things like training. The tools will still be `Experimental`, but should be a bit easier to use. In the meantime, there is a bit more information about how to access the existing hd5 file [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4511).

Deployability,Hi @brisk022 . There is an update for this issue. We were able to recreate this problem in our hands and looks like there is a memory management issue somewhere in the GenomicsDB related code inside GenotypeGVCFs. . Our temporary solution until we make an updated release would be to convert imported genomicsDB instances to GVCF using . `gatk SelectVariants -V gendb://instancename -O GVCF_export.g.vcf.gz -R ref.fa -L whateverintervalusedinGDBimport`. and later using this GVCF file as input for the GenotypeGVCFs tool. This ensures that memory usage won't go above unreasonable levels and won't cause any appearant leaks. . I hope this helps.

Deployability,"Hi @cccnrc, glad you found this discussion interesting and apologies for the very late reply. Unfortunately, there hasn't been much movement on this front, as I think we decided that the current model sufficed. I think we are moving in a direction so that we can obviate the need for a separate step to fit global (e.g., depth) and per-contig (e.g., contig ploidy) parameters for each sample. Recall that this is only necessary because each gCNV genomic shard needs these quantities to perform inference, but cannot infer them from the data they are responsible for fitting (which typically covers less than a contig). We are looking to reimplement gCNV in a more modern inference framework that could allow us to do away with such sharding entirely. We could thus fit global/per-contig quantities of interest jointly with the rest of the gCNV model. The timeframe for this work may be relatively long (~year), but I think it'll be worth it. That said, I think a key takeaway from this work is that genotype priors can be more powerful for breaking degeneracies than contig-ploidy priors, so we will probably try to incorporate that insight in future work. To answer your questions:; 1) There are no additional results much further beyond what is shown above.; 2) You can see snippets/comparisons of the genotype and contig-ploidy prior file above. If you're just looking for information about the contig-ploidy prior table used in the current pipeline, see an example at https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360051304711-DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and feel free to modify it to be more/less strict as desired.; 3) Unfortunately I believe the samples discussed above are not publicly available.

Deployability,Hi @danieljrichard. I suspect the error message you're seeing is a not the underlying problem. Sometimes when the tool crashes there are errors during standard shutdown cleanup that hide the real problem. There's a [recent patch](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/f7dea3c08b126c56b851c4d381cfdb5513e0584f) which makes it so that should happen much less but it's not in any currently released version.

Deployability,Hi @dantefff. We're planning on officially moving GATK to use java 11 by default in the relatively near future. I don't have an exact timeline. It's definitely annoying to not have it work out of the box on most linux systems and it's something we want to do soon. I have had very limited bandwidth lately and updating to 11 has been a casualty of that. Now that the world is rebooting things should start to tick along faster and I hope to have it updated soon.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7333#issuecomment-871615858:449,update,updated,449,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7333#issuecomment-871615858,1,['update'],['updated']

All of the surrounding tools have produced the expected outputs when queried except for Mutect2.

Deployability,"Hi @fpbarthel,. You have a few options, but I think they would all require a bit of manual processing on your part. For example, you could use CollectReadCounts with your initial list of bins, but then you'd have to do the averaging step manually. Hopefully, it should not be too trouble to put together your own script to do this; however, since it is somewhat of a custom operation, it's unlikely we'll support it as a feature. In any case, note that the rest of the downstream tools in both our germline and somatic pipelines are only set up to work with integer counts. I don't know your reasons for wanting to average counts over multiple bins, but since 1) averages contain less information than the full resolution bins, 2) the BAM I/O to perform count collection is expensive (so we don't want to discard information during the CollectReadCounts step that we might need later), and 3) we want to build generative models of the counts, our philosophy is to always retain the integer counts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439892644:519,pipeline,pipelines,519,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439892644,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

Deployability,"Hi @pieterlukasse. This is a great question and somewhat timely. Funcotator hasn't gotten the attention it needs lately because the engineer who's most involved has been extremely busy with other very high priority projects. We intend to support it going forward but it's unclear if that means bug fixes and reactive support or if we're able to make major upgrades. We're currently in the middle of somewhat of a resource crunch, and we are actively planning how to prioritize our attention in the future. . I think if you're basically happy with features now, you should feel safe investing the time into an output parser. If there are major improvements you need I would wait a week or two and ask again then because we'll have more clarity about what we can do. . If you're interested I would consider contributing back your code the GATK core. There's some existing utility code that could probably help you, but there's a long standing gap in our tooling for users to make sense of the funcotations and we'd welcome improvements or new tools. @jonn-smith @droazen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8154#issuecomment-1378997296:356,upgrade,upgrades,356,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8154#issuecomment-1378997296,1,['upgrade'],['upgrades']
Deployability,"Hi @ruslan-abasov,. I believe your GermlineCNVCaller results should have inherited the correct dictionary from the count files. The issue is you created some GermlineCNVCaller shards (e.g., shard 4) with inappropriately ordered intervals (since these were instead ordered w.r.t. to the idiosyncratic dictionary you attached). However, I think if you just reshard and rerun GermlineCNVCaller for any such shards, you may be able to reuse most of your results. For example, you could take your shard 4 interval list, which contains intervals from chr18, chr19, and chr1, and reshard these intervals into two shards: 4a containing chr18-19 intervals, and 4b containing chr1 intervals. After rerunning 4a and 4b through GermlineCNVCaller, you should be able to use PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to stitch together shards 4b, 1, 2, 3, and 4a, since these will be ordered w.r.t. the correct dictionary from the count files (i.e, they will contain intervals in the order chr1, chr10-19). Of course, you will want not want to perform this exact procedure; you'll want to generalize it to whatever will yield the correct order for all 10 of your shards across all contigs. Again, this may be error prone and I can't guarantee that it will be successful, since I haven't tried it myself. I would personally just rerun the pipeline. You might be able to cut down on runtime by using smaller shards (I believe we typically shard the entire genome into far more than 10 shards, which we usually run in parallel) and making sure you set parameters appropriately for WGS. @mwalker174 has the most experience running on WGS and should be able to provide you the latest recommendations, or you might be able to find them by searching GitHub or the GATK Forums. Your point is well taken about failing earlier, and I think I've outlined the best strategy above. It is impossible to catch all possible errors early, but for some we can certainly fail before the GermlineCNVCaller step.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-720091802:1310,pipeline,pipeline,1310,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-720091802,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @tomwhite! The serializer registrations in ADAM shouldn't effect any GATK serialization, unless you're serializing classes from ADAM (such as `org.bdgenomics.format.avro.AlignmentRecord`); additionally, we haven't seen any performance issues with serialization in ADAM 0.23.0 outside of the GATK. We actually made a number of patches to eliminate logging in 0.23.0 (relative to 0.22.0), so I'd doubt that is the culprit. The one exception to this is logging when writing Parquet out to disk, which greatly increased sometime between ADAM 0.21.0 and 0.23.0, due to a change in Parquet versions upstream in Spark. However, this would only impact you if you were writing Parquet, and additionally this issue was resolved with the release of Spark 2.2.0, so you should see the logging go away with #4314. If I had to hypothesize anything, I'd suggest that the 2bit file change is the one thing that could be biting you. That said, we've been running with this 2bit file code quite frequently on AWS and Azure for at least the last 6 months using GATK HC on WES and WGS data and haven't seen any performance issues. I show that the changes in the 2bit file code between ADAM 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 are API compatible, so if you check out ADAM 0.23.0 and then `git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.11-0.20.0 adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/util/TwoBitFile.scala` and build the ADAM JAR (and then package that jar into GATK), you should be able to test that hypothesis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897:329,patch,patches,329,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897,2,"['patch', 'release']","['patches', 'release']"

Deployability,"Hi Adam,. Thank you for this amazing work, and would like to suggest something small without disturbing the test-flow. So unless I'm not mistaken, the class that is consuming the memory is [NestedIntegerArray.java](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/master/public/gatk-utils/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/utils/collections/NestedIntegerArray.java). Why not try an experiment where you implement something similar to [Google's SSTable](https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/) that got release as [leveldb](https://github.com/google/leveldb). For instance the key-index lookup for you can be hash or a hash+offset. Basically these structures borrow from the concept of a [Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) - link is a PDF paper](http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/18e91eb4db2114a06ea614f0384f2784.pdf). You can push most of these to disk instead of memory, and they can be compressed as well. The indices can remain in memory for fast-lookup with the data staying on disk. So for instance, you can generate an key-index digest of specific values via `hash_function(numReadGroups.id, qualDimension.index, eventDimension.type)`, whose result you then use to quickly lookup the value for that key - which would reside on disk. That can be further improved with a priority queue cache for the most accessed values.

I'm not certain, but I would suspect that a significant percentage of your users may also not use the best practices pipeline for one reason or another.

Deployability,"Hi GATK team!; I would like a minimum fragment length filter during calling CNVs (the CountReads step) if possible. @LeeTL1220 helped me to find an option to set a maximum fragment length with `--read_filter FragmentLength --maxFragmentLength <value>` ([link to the GATK forum page](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/2338/how-can-i-invoke-read-filters-and-their-arguments)). However, it appears there is no minimum fragment length filter implemented. Would it be possible to include the min fragment filter option in the future release or as a pre-release version?. The reason of asking this filter is:. there are shorter fragments in a FFPE tumor PCR-free WGS (top) compared to the PCR-plus WGS (bottom) from the same individual:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5141643/56065278-611c9a80-5d42-11e9-8b60-b82ea1d69e87.png); and I observed higher MAD values in the PCR-free samples.

Deployability,"Hi Karthik @kvn95ss ,. This isn't going to do what you want it to do if we implement it as you suggest. The latest GVCF formats try to preserve more annotation data so we can get better statistical power by using all mapping quality values (for example) rather than taking the median across all samples. As such, genomicsDB is going to return a value that isn't usable by VariantRecalibrator without going through GenotypeGVCFs to take the final mean and square root of the stored sum of the squared MQ values. GenomicsDB also won't calculate the FS or SOR values; it will only return the strand bias table. Finally, GenotypeGVCFs will apply a QUAL threshold to remove the lowest evidence variants so your final callset isn't riddled with false positives.

Deployability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready.

When whole contig is given as interval all variant sites in the multisample VCF is reported with DP value much less than what it is supposed to be in samples where no variation occur. Samples with variants are shown as expected DP. Setting ploidy 2 for this analysis restores the expected DP value for samples with HOMREF sites no matter what interval is used.

Deployability,"Hi everyone,. I am going to use GATK4 to carry out population-based snp-calling for around 500 samples with the ploidy level from 2 to 6.; The sequence depth varied from 2x to 80x. Since there are many samples with low sequence depth (<5x), I was advised to use the population-based snp-calling pipeline. ; Recently, I met some problems in the flowchart of this analysis. Firstly, I found the pipelines that detailedly explained the flowchart of BQSR and variant calling for single-sample snp-calling. But I have no idea about the pipeline of the BQSR in population-based snp-calling. Should I apply the BQSR sample by sample following the flowchart menthioned above (the command line below), and then used these corrected bam files to identify the variants based on population-based method?

Deployability,"Hi folks. @chandrans and I have laid out some plans towards updating GATK4 docs for the January 9 release. Our approach is to prioritize documentation around stable Best Practice Workflows. On the docket currently is the single stable workflow--germline SNP and indel calling from DNA data. We will of course update tool docs (excluding Spark and BWA tools) and supporting tutorials. Even for tools we are unfamiliar with, we aim to have at the least a basic description and an example command. Thanks for the documentation you have already done and the help you give us in updating these. If you are certain your workflow will be ready for the release, then please let us know immediately so we can plan accordingly. If your workflow will be ready later, then can you still give us an estimate for your release so we can plan ahead? Thanks. - @davidbenjamin, did I hear you correctly that you think somatic SNV and indel calling will be ready for the Jan 9 release?; - @samuelklee, I know major changes are currently afoot for somatic CNV. Will you make the Jan 9 release for the targeted exomes use-case? What about WGS?; - @mbabadi, is March, 2018 still the plan?; - @jonn-smith, what is the status on the Tool-That-Must-Not-Be-Named?; - @cwhelan @tedsharpe @SHuang-Broad, is SV on for next year or thereafter?. It would be most helpful to users if we also have validation of our workflows as applied to real data. Are there plans to make benchmarking stats available for each of your workflows?.

Deployability,"Hi! This issue is a duplicate of #7054 - under the hood a few changes need to be made to support arbitrary `FeatureTag`s. ; As gencode is updated they seem to be adding more `FeatureTag`s, which Funcotator doesn't expect. The fix is relatively straight-forward, but requires several other changes as well. Unfortunately there isn't a good workaround right now. As a side-note, the `getGencode.sh` script you referenced (and all scripts in that same folder: `scripts/funcotator/data_sources`) are not supported and are designed to be for internal use (I have a file in that folder to indicate this, but I'll admit it's not 100% clear). That said, `getGencode.sh` should work properly - the issue is in the GATK itself (specifically in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.codecs.gtf.GencodeGtfTranscriptFeature` and associated classes). This is on the short list of things to update next, so I'll try to get to it soon (though I'm not exactly sure when that will be).

Adding something like :.

Deployability,"Hi, I think this issue was driven by our use case. We have a GenomicsDBImport/GenotypeGVCFs pipeline that for efficient parallelisation purposes we would like to run on adjacent 10kb intervals. The problem is that we are interested in correctly calling spanning deletions that span across the interval boundaries. Here is an example of the first two variants of an interval starting at Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001; ; ```; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400001 . AG A,GG,CG 952.47 . AC=2,2,1; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400002 . GCCGAA *,ACCGAA,TCCGAA 236625 . AC=306,21,155; ```; ; And here are the same two variants, but this time from an interval starting before Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001:; ; ```; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400001 . AG *,A,GG,CG 952.47 . AC=304,1,2,1; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400002 . GCCGAA *,ACCGAA,TCCGAA 236625 . AC=306,21,155; ```; ; As you'll see, the first version is missing the spanning deletion at Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001. You'll also notice that the allele counts for the A allele are different between the two versions (2 vs 1). So for the interval Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001-1410000, we want the output to look like the second example above, not the first.; ; We are only interested in having calls for positions that lie within the interval, so in the above case we don't want to see any calls for position Pf3D7_07_v3:1400000 or earlier.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6335#issuecomment-567487326:92,pipeline,pipeline,92,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6335#issuecomment-567487326,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi,. I've encountered an issue with the R script generated by `VariantRecalibrator` during my analysis. The generated R script uses color functions (`scale_fill_gradient`) where the RGB color space is still being employed to calculate the gradient. However, in newer versions of R, the ggplot2 and scales libraries have deprecated the RGB color space, and the library now requires the ""Lab"" color space to calculate the gradient. This issue causes the R script to fail unless it is later modified by the user to use `scale_fill_gradient(..., space = ""Lab"")`. Updating the script generation in `VariantRecalibrator` would prevent this problem and make the R script compatible with newer versions of R, and ggplot2. an scales libraries. Here is the suggested change:. update : scale_fill_gradient(..., space = ""rgb""); to : scale_fill_gradient(..., space = ""Lab""). Versions:.

Deployability,"Hi,; I recently used GATK4 Spark local version for somatic variant call. The machine has 40 cores and 160g mem. I tried 20 and 10 cores for each tumor/normal pair in the BQSR step (BaseRecalibratorSpark) and the two samples are processed at the same time. However, the pipeline frequently failes (errors like outofmemory, cannot allocate a page) unless I use 4 cores for each sample. I think the problem should be solved by tuning Spark and JAVA parameters. I considered options like `--conf spark.driver.memory=10g`, `-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10` but had no luck.

It [sounds like](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/18689) the failure mode is to crash. For running inference at least (training may be a different story), we may need something better.

Deployability,"Hmm, looks like we lose events 1 and 3 with CollectReadCounts at 250bp using analogous ModelSegments parameters. However, I experimented with tweaking the segmentation to work on the copy ratios (rather than the log2 copy ratios), which seems to recover them. Although one of the goals of having evaluations backed by SV truth sets is to tune such parameters/methods, I'm beginning to think that SV integration might benefit from using the CNV tools in a more customized pipeline---especially if maximizing sensitivity at resolutions of ~100bp jointly with breakpoint evidence is the goal. For example, you might imagine a tool that directly uses CNV backend code to collect coverage over regions specified by `-L`, builds a PoN, denoises, and segments on the fly.

Deployability,"How much does count collection cost at the desired bin size? How does this compare to bincov? Perhaps we could eliminate one of these steps if redundant. Note that the read counts are read once and stored in memory, so unless this takes a significant amount of time, then indexing is probably not the highest priority here (although I agree it would be nice to have in general). One related issue, as you mention, is file localization---since each shard only operates on a portion of the counts in each sample, it is a bit wasteful to localize the whole file. But how much does file localization cost? I can't imagine that it is the lowest hanging fruit. One of the more important issues, which you also mention, is optimizing parameters for inference. This includes not only the minimum number of epochs for training, but also things like the learning rate, annealing schedule, iterations per epoch, conditions for epoch convergence, etc. I'll be talking about how to tune these inference parameters---as well as other things in the pipeline---at the next BSV meeting.

Original VCF header: . ```; ##FORMAT=<ID=GQ,Number=1,Type=String,Description=""Genotype quality (currently not supported. Always 0)"">; ```. Updated VCF header: . ```; ##FORMAT=<ID=GQ,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=""Genotype Quality"">; ```. From what I can see, the updated text is used frequently in your GATK VCF files, but I can't dig out the specific code where it is being set via `UpdateVCFSequenceDictionary`. I am wondering if there is a collision where `UpdateVCFSequenceDictionary` detects GQ and prints a stock header field to match expectation, rather than leaving it alone. I would expect the tool to simply replace the dictionary portion of the VCF without modifying the FORMAT/INFO fields. This is causing issues with downstream analysis because SVABA QC values are float/string not integer.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8629:48,release,release,48,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8629,7,"['Update', 'release', 'update']","['UpdateVCFSequenceDictionary', 'Updated', 'release', 'updated']"

Nevertheless, I cannot use them unless I hack my `Genotype` object beforehand.

Deployability,"I did a simple experiment and changed the version of Java used in the non-Docker (""17"", although again I'm not sure what this actually resolves to) to that used in the Docker (17.0.1+12).

Moreover, the test failures produce exactly the same discrepant numerical results. I think we can probably conclude that the expected test results were generated with ""17"" and that changing to 17.0.1+12 generates different results. This is not too unreasonable; see the Slack thread linked in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8111#issuecomment-1331407680, for example, which shows that we might be getting into pretty hairy territory and that even changes to things like how HotSpot Intrinsics are implemented in each JVM can cause the numerical differences we see here.

Deployability,"I did some more work on the broadcast approach to see how feasible it would be, and found that Spark Dataflow made two unnecessary copies of the data (now fixed: https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow/pull/60), which caused OOM errors when trying to broadcast the 3GB reference data. With this fixed, I ran a [pipeline called JoinReferencesDataflow](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/dataflow/pipelines/JoinReferencesDataflow.java) on a small cluster that broadcasts the reference as a dataflow view. The code is a modified version of CountReadsDataflow that simply sends the view, and then doesn't use it, so we can see the cost of doing a broadcast (See the rest of the code in this branch: https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/tree/hadoop-references). JoinReferencesDataflow took 2 min 25s to run, of which 18s were for reading the reference from the local filesystem in the driver. For comparison, CountReadsDataflow took 17s on the same cluster. So broadcasting the reference takes less than 2 minutes. Note that this was just for one task, but Spark has [an efficient protocol for sending broadcast variables](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~agearh/cs267.sp10/files/mosharaf-spark-bc-report-spring10.pdf), which scales well with the number of nodes, so the approach looks feasible. Having said all that, we might still want to use the sharding approach, in order to share more code between the Google and Spark dataflow implementations. One way this could work would be to generalize `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata` to support reading reference data from a [ReferenceHadoopSource](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/dataflow/datasources/ReferenceHadoopSource.java), which is in line with @droazen's last comment.

Deployability,"I feel like this is going to be problematic in a different way than what @magicDGS is mentioning. We expect many versions of gatk to be compatible with the same python environment. Also for performance reasons we want to start avoid rebuilding the conda environment on every push and bake it into the base docker instead. This change means we definitely have to build it every time. . It feels like we need something more sophisticated. Instead of stamping the conda environment with the gatk version that matches it, maybe we should be stamping the gatk jar and the conda environment with some version based on the conda.env? Maybe we can do something like taking the md5 of the conda.yml and pushing that into both the jar manifest and the conda environment in some way?

Deployability,"I found some edge cases when implemented a new walker based on GATKTool that should be considered in the base class to avoid some mistakes by developers. They should either being correctly handled or documented as not-applicable for some walkers:. - [ ] If a tool/walker overrides getPluginDescriptors to remove the `GATKReadFilterPluginDescriptor`, the method `makeReadFilter` will not return a filter with the `getDefaultReadFilters`. This is important for implementing tools where the user shouldn't be able to override the filters. I suggest to either handle the case where the plugin cannot be detected and return a filter with only defaults, or to specify in the documentation that `makeReadFilter` should be overriden in that case. - [ ] Transformer methods for reads (`makePreReadFilterTransformer`and `makePostReadFilterTransformer`) only have effect in `ReadWalker`(and extensions). I think that the `ReadsContext` should have a method to set pre/post transformers, and call this methods to integrate with every extension of `GATKTool`. Otherwise, it should be documented that it has no effect in most of the cases. @droazen - could you give me some way to proceed here?

Deployability,"I have no problems whatsoever with the code, but I do have some concerns about the design:. In the SV group's pipeline, we distribute this multi-gig file from its home in the cloud once at cluster-creation time, and then reuse it for multiple client executions. There are no superfluous copies lying about anywhere, and no redundant copying operations. We can give it any name we wish, and put it anywhere we desire (except that the path must be the same on every worker). This code, if I'm reading it correctly, will redistribute the file from a non-permanent home on the master's local file system or on the HDFS (to which it must be copied redundantly at least once per cluster instantiation), and then it will further be redundantly copied to a temporary location on each worker's local file system with every client execution. I don't know if that's overhead that we can live with, or whether that might prevent us from writing clients with brief execution times. I'm just opening the issue for discussion. We also lose a little flexibility in that the image must live in the same directory as the reference, though I don't think that's a serious drawback -- it's a perfectly logical place for it. However, since we're just appending a fixed extension ("".img"") to the reference name we can only have one image file per reference, which may be a problem because different images need to be created for different versions of bwa and for various options such as the list of alt contigs. We can handle the first problem by insisting that all clients on a particular cluster stick to one version of bwa, which is probably a good idea, anyway, but I think we're stuck if clients need to specify various alt contig lists. It might be better to provide a default path of ""ref-name""+"".img"", but allow that default to be overridden. Also, just to twist the knife a bit, it's too bad we never reviewed my PR for gatk-bwamem-jni, which version-stamped the images for safety.

Deployability,"I have three main reasons to propose to move the arguments in CLP to an argument collection that is configurable by downstream tools/projects:. 1. Support hiding some arguments for downstream projects. For example, I do not want to support a config file by the user, but rather decide the settings for the framework and expose only some configuration.; 1. Set custom defaults for some downstream tools (including GATK). For example, a concrete tool might want to force the temp directory to be specified to avoid failures due to no space (and specify that in the documentation).; 1. Support old-style arguments (not kebab-case) for downstream projects that rely on the current argument definitions. I am specially affected by this one, because updating GATK to the 4.0.0 release of January will be a breaking change that will cause some nightmares for my users - and I don't want to do a major version bump yet (I have to re-work a bit my own framework before it). Thus, the first commit of this PR holds the proposal for the new argument collection. As I know that the team is also trying to normalize arguments and documentation, I included two more commits to help with the task (they can be removed if you think that it is better after the argument collection):; * Use `java.nio.Path` for temp directories (to support temp directories in HDFS, for example); * Change arguments moved to the collection to kebab-case (to help with #3853)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998:337,configurat,configuration,337,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998,2,"['configurat', 'release']","['configuration', 'release']"
Deployability,"I have to deal with this component recently and I found the design rather awkward.... In general between GATK and htsjdk we don't seem to have a proper support for managing and querying Supplementary alignment information from read alignment records:. 1. Querying: implemented in htsjdk consists in forging artificial SAMRecords that contain only the alignment info in the SA tag element... It seems to me that it makes more sense to create class to hold this information alone (e.g. ReadAlignmentInfo or ReadAlignment); SATagBuilder already has defined a private inner class with that in mind ""SARead"" so why not flesh it out and make it public. 2. Writing: currently SATagBuilder gets attached to a read, parsing its current SA attribute content into SARead instances. It provides the possibility adding additional SAM record one by one or clearing the list. ... then it actually updates the SA attribute on the original read when a method (setTag) is explicitly called.; I don't see the need to attach the SATag Builder to a read... it could perfectly be free standing; the same builder could be re-apply to several reads for that matter and I don't see any gain in hiding the read SA tag setting process,... even if typically this builder output would go to the ""SA"" tag, perhaps at some point we would like to also write SA coordinate list somewhere else, some other tag name or perhaps an error message... why impose this single purpose limitation?; I suggest to drop the notion of a builder for a more general custom ReadAlignmentInfo (or whatever name) list. Such list could be making reference to a dictionary to validate its elements, prevent duplicates, keep the primary SA in the first position... etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324:882,update,updates,882,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324,1,['update'],['updates']
Deployability,"I haven't been able to reproduce this locally by running `ReadsPipelineSparkIntegrationTest` repeatedly. In fact, it looks like another test is interacting with this one, since the stack trace references HDFS paths, but this test doesn't use HDFS at all. Another oddity: `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` implies it's reading a vcf.idx file, but `HaplotypeCallerSpark`, where the exception occurs, is not reading any VCF files (although BQSR does earlier in the pipeline for known sites). Also, we shouldn't be serializing `FeatureDataSource` objects with remote resources any more, since we use Spark `--files` to copy them to the worker nodes (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/spark/GATKSparkTool.java#L699).

Deployability,I like it and want to put it in but we can't unless the code compiles and runs on the Mac. I'd be fine with having Mac use just 1 thread if need be but the code must compile and run. With some hacking @lbergelson was able to compile and run it but it's not something we want users to do. The official XCode on the Mac does not include OpenMP and having our users go through a complex install of an alternative clang is a no-starter for us. Also non-starter is removal of native PairHMM from the Mac. . So I think we have 2 options:; a) change the code+build to disable OMP on the Mac (ie have Mac be single threaded). The benefit is that we can start running with improved performance right away on linux. That includes production (when we're ready with the HaplotypeCaller); b) wait until the new intel gatk native library is done and then move the problem of compiling etc to that repo. That would remove the burden of building this from us and shift to the other repo's owners who can then build their library however they want and we'd only pick up compiled versions. @gspowley @lbergelson @droazen votes?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1813#issuecomment-218849928:384,install,install,384,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1813#issuecomment-218849928,1,['install'],['install']

In java: ""false && false || true"" gives true, which is not what you want.

Having then in the command line will generate software users to run them instead of use them for developmental purposes... In addition, I think that this is a good moment to also generate a sub-module structure (as I suggested in #3838) to separate artifact for different pipelines/framework bits (e.g., engine, Spark-engine, experimental, example-code, CNV pipeline, general-tools, etc.). For the aim of this issue, this will be useful for setting documentation guidelines in each of the sub-modules: e.g., example-code should be documented for developers, but not for the final user; experimental module should have the `@Experimental` barclay annotation in every `@DocumentedFeature`; etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346291829:180,integrat,integration,180,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346291829,3,"['integrat', 'pipeline']","['integration', 'pipeline', 'pipelines']"

I did some crude timing tests using the FeatureDataSource default (1000 bases) proposed in this branch, and the current default (100,000 bases). The following are total times as reported by Gradle for serial runs of the VQSR integration tests:. With 1000 base lookahead:; 1m40s; 1m29s; 1m29s; 1m25s.

Deployability,"I think changes in 4.2.4.1 are exposing an issue, but I think @eriqande is right that the issue isn't with GenomicsDB. The change was that previously GATK wasn't correctly passing the `--max-alternate-allele` argument to GenomicsDB, but now that it is doing so it makes it more likely that some sites don't contain fields like PL (dependent on number of possible genotypes). It looks like the AF calculation used to ignore sites if they didn't have likelihoods, but has now been updated slightly to also allow sites with GQ or sites where any alleles are called+nonref+not symbolic. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/caa48f98c8207b688db6ee35fead3eafb7219e38/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/GenotypeUtils.java#L139-L141. Possibly that condition needs to be tweaked? @ldgauthier might be the best person to ask. As for this working with previous versions, that is only because the `--max-alternate-alleles` wasn't being passed to GenomicsDB correctly. if you want to revert to that behavior you can set `--max-alternate-alleles` to `50` (which is what GenomicsDB defaults to).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941:479,update,updated,479,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941,1,['update'],['updated']

I divided the PRs for the `IndelRealignment` into 4 different sections for better review (2 components of indel-realignment, `RealignerTargetCreator`and `IndelRealignment`). This strategy is because I dissected the pipeline into the easy `RealignerTargetCreator` to found regions worth to look at (this could be marked as experimental/beta before the indel-realignment is in) and the more complicated and component-based `IndelRealigner` (the same as with other tools, this can be marked as experimental/beta until a really good coverage is achieved - in the meantime, I have some test with the current data in the repository and the GATK3 counterpart). There are two parts that are usable outside `IndelRealigner` that are worthy to separate into two commits, and might be useful for other tools/downstream projects: `ConstrainedMateFixingManager` and `NWaySAMFileWriter`. That's the reason of making the port in split PRs. One option can be to have the PRs open, and reviewed independently without acceptance until every component is ready.

Deployability,"I think that this is a nice feature (at least for me) and not a bug.

I can understand that it could be also nice to preserve the `-RF read_filters.args` to be able to modify the file an re-run the tool with different parameters, but for me the purpose of storing the command line in the header or other places is keep track of the exact params that I used: if a file is modified, then it is impossible to trace the params. For input files, this is expected (if the input has changed, it is expected that the result change), but for arguments it shouldn't be the case (independently of the file changing, the tool was running with exactly that parameters).

Deployability,"I thought after the last comment of @vdauwera in the [blog post about the removal](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7131/is-indel-realignment-removed-from-gatk4) that it will be possible to port it here as a contribution (without too much effort from your dev team). If the final solution is that this is not going to be maintained in GATK4, I would port this code to my own software if you give me the permission; but it is definitely something that the community is interested. For example, I'm working with Pool-Seq data with hundreds of individuals together, so `HaplotypeCaller` is not a possibility in our case. I'm actually evaluating other approaches for realignment, such as [ABRA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu376) or [SRMA](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r99). I'm even thinking on implementing a new realigner based on the GATK's assembler engine and its PairHMM; but this requires more time for evaluation, and it will be nice to be able to compare with the current indel realignment pipeline.

Deployability,"I would like to reiterate that the one code path in ADAM that is. 1. changed between 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 and; 2. that is used in both the GATK BQSR and HC engines. is the two bit file parsing and extraction engine. The main commit that changed in that code path was https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/commit/1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810, which reverts cleanly on ADAM trunk. There are also some changes in the `ReferenceRegion` class, they appear to be mostly cosmetic, but this necessitated changing one parameter from `null` to `Strand.INDEPENDENT` in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/8a366c7ba570c61338f7109b86c3284b80d5cf47. The GATK does one lookup into the TwoBitFile (which creates one ReferenceRegion along the way) per read during BQSR and two per assembly region during HC, so this code is inside your inner loop. Again, all it should take to test this hypothesis is:. ```; git clone git@github.com:bigdatagenomics/adam.git; cd adam; git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.10-0.23.0; git revert 1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810; mvn install -DskipTests; ```. You'd then need to build the GATK with the JAR this generates. If this makes the perf regression go away, then we can easily revert this change in ADAM 0.24.0, which will release two weeks from now.

Deployability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now. As for workspaces with whole chromosomes -- there is no requirement or performance benefits to using whole chromosomes. As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace.

However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call).

I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to do this in GATK4. One solution is to override traverse(), and add some kind of groupingBy step, for example:. StreamSupport.stream(getSpliteratorForDrivingVariants(), false); .filter(variantfilter); .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> new SimpleInterval(x))); .values(); .forEach(variantList -> {; final SimpleInterval variantInterval = new SimpleInterval(variantList.get(0));; apply(variantList,; new ReadsContext(reads, variantInterval, readFilter),; new ReferenceContext(reference, variantInterval),; new FeatureContext(features, variantInterval));. progressMeter.update(variantInterval);; });. This will get me the right end result (like of variants per site); however, it's not clear to me if this is the most efficient route, and I'm not sure if it's aware of the sorted input. Because the input data are sorted, I could iterate, track the previous location and maintain a list of track variants per site. Each time we hit a new location I call apply() with that list.

Deployability,"If you'd prefer i post this kind of question elsewhere, please let me know. My lab creates a large dataset of macaque variant data. We regularly add new samples to a dataset that currently has ~2300 WGS/WXS datasets. We largely follow the GATK short variant calling pipeline. Our gVCF data are aggregated into a GenomicsDb workspace, followed by GenotypeGVCFs. As is, whenever we get new samples, we append them to this growing GenomicsDb workspace, and then re-call all of the genotypes. These steps are getting slower and slower (even when scatter/gathered on a cluster), and I'm concerned it's going to become untenable. Plus it's just really inefficient to constantly re-call 1000s of datasets at 40m genome-wide sites. My question is: do you have any experience with analogous datasets, where you have a large base of ""static"" datasets with regular additions of new data? It would be quite nice to avoid constantly re-genotyping the existing datasets. We could in theory just run GenotypeGVCFs on the incoming data and do a simple merge with the existing data. Are you aware of anyone running a process that looks more like this?. There are some caveats to this: 1) for the incoming batches of data, we could run GenotypeGVCF where we force it to call genotypes from every site that exists in the current dataset. This would promote consistent calling across a common set of sites, 2) after we genotype the incoming batch, we could compare the sites present in that against the sites in the current data. It's likely there would be a handful of novel sites. We could re-run GenotypeGVCFs on the existing data specifically on those new sites (presumably the existing animals are largely WT at those positions), and merge those new sites with the existing data, 3) we then merge the incoming data with the updated core data, which should each have genotypes called at the identical set of sites. Are there any discussions happening about managing/updating large variant datasets like this?

Users pass in a configuration table (see tool documentation for an example) specifying one or more stratification groups classified by SVTYPE, SVLEN range, and reference context(s). The latter are specified as a set of interval lists using `--context-name` and `--context-intervals` arguments. All variants are matched with their respective group which is annotated in the `STRAT` INFO field. Optionally, the output can be split into multiple VCFs by group, which is a very useful functionality that currently can't be done efficiently with common commands/toolkits.; - `GroupedSVCluster` - a hybrid tool combining functionality from `SVStratify` with `SVCluster` to perform intra-stratum clustering. This tool is critical for fine-tuned clustering of specific variants types within certain reference contexts. For example, small variants in simple repeats tend to have lower breakpoint accuracy and are typically ""reclustered"" during call set refinement with looser clustering criteria.; - `SVStratificationEngine` - new class for performing stratification.; - Updates to breakpoint refinement in `CanonicalSVCollapser` that should improve breakpoint accuracy, particularly in larger call sets. Raw evidence support and variant quality are now considered when choosing a representative breakpoint for a group of clustered SVs.; - Added `FlagFieldLogic` type for customizing how `BOTHSIDE_PASS` and `HIGH_SR_BACKGROUND` INFO flags are collapsed during clustering.; - `RD_CN` is now used as a backup if `CN` is not available when determining carrier status for sample overlap.; - Removed no-sort option in favor of spooled sorting.; - Bug fix: support for empty EVIDENCE info fields; - Bug fix: in one of the JointGermlineCnvDefragmenter tests",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8990:29,update,updates,29,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8990,4,"['Update', 'configurat', 'integrat', 'update']","['Updates', 'configuration', 'integration', 'updates']"

This essentially freezes current ModelSegments behavior, which has been exactly stable since https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5814; that is, from sometime between 4.1.0.0/4.1.1.0 almost 3 years ago up to 4.2.4.1 today. Note that the original test files were generated from the test BAMs (e.g., src/test/resources/large/cnv_somatic_workflows_test_files/HCC1143-t1-chr20-downsampled.deduplicated.bam), since these BAMs have been used in the past to consistently generate test files for other tools in the ModelSegments and GermlineCNVCaller pipelines. However, these original test files contained insufficient data to activate the changes found in #7649, even had exact-match tests been present. I thus took some old HCC1143T 100% WES data that I had and snippeted it to chr20. I've confirmed that the added tests with these files would've picked up the regression of log10factorial seen in #7649 for all relevant modes (i.e., all those that take in the allele counts as input, since that regression only affected allele-fraction MCMC sampling). Tests take maybe an additional minute to run and there was about ~12MB of additional large resources checked in, but I didn't try too hard to bring either down. I also added some early-fail parameter validation to check that the minimum total allele count in the case sample is zero in matched-normal mode. There are actually some open questions in my mind as to what the best behavior should be here, but given some of the discussion in #6499 and possible plans for using joint segmentation to do filtering of germline events, I think it's best to enforce that all het sites coming out of the genotyping step are the same across all samples.

Deployability,In light of the recent #7357 and #7358 it has become clear that we are blind changes that cause the logging outputs for GATK to become unusable because we are spitting endless warnings to stdout. I think we should change our integration tests to capture the log output for each of our tests and assert that none of them balloon beyond some reasonable threshold that would capture these problems (perhaps a megabyte but it would take a little bit of sleuthing to be sure). . I would think the best place would be to add a capture into `CommandLineProgramTest.runCommandLine()` that instead of using the current behavior `injectDefaultVerbosity()` we instead leave the logging output as the default and capture it somewhere explicit where we can make assertions about the size of the outputs. Possibly we could create a dummy logging level that just saves and counts the outputs so we can make assertions about the logs. Ideally this should apply to every tool simultaneously since it would be too patchwork to simply add logging output tests for enough of the tools to protect us manually.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368:225,integrat,integration,225,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368,2,"['integrat', 'patch']","['integration', 'patchwork']"

Deployability,"In order of priority:. 1) The ability to query and/or stream intervals for locatable collections might reduce the overhead of file localization in the germline workflows---even though we only run GermlineCNVCaller on a subset of intervals in any particular shard, we localize the entire read-count file. This could be enabled in the parent class to benefit all locatable files, but since it will probably require indexing, we should use only when necessary.; 2) Memory requirements for some tools could be reduced by avoiding intermediate creation of an internally held list, streaming it directly instead.; 3) NIO streaming of entire files to/from buckets could be easily added to the relevant CSV/HDF5 read/write classes. Apart from the first issue, I don't think this really adds much, since the largest files are only ~1GB (and most seg files are much smaller) and are typically cheap to localize for single samples. See also #3976, #4004, #4717, and #5715 for context. I think we should first demonstrate if the first issue is really the dominating cost in the germline pipeline.

Deployability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Deployability,"In the process of unifying CalculateTargetCoverage / SparkGenomeReadCounts for the rewrite of the CNV pipeline, we decided to experiment with switching over to fragment-based counts due to a request from CGA. For each fragment, CollectFragmentCounts adds a count to *the bin that overlaps with the fragment center*. We filter to properly-paired, first-of-pair reads in order to have well formed fragments and avoid double counting. We also filter out duplicates. In contrast, CalculateTargetCoverage added a count to *all bins that overlapped with a read* and SparkGenomeReadCounts added a count to *the bin that contained the read start*. These tools kept duplicates. However, none of these collection strategies have been rigorously evaluated. Using a small set of WGS SV tandem-duplication calls from @mwalker174 as a truth set, I did some experimenting with changing the count-collection strategy. (We initially thought we were missing some of these simply due to over-denoising/filtering by the PoN, but as we'll see below, the count-collection strategy plays a non-trivial role.). Subsetting to chr3, I built a small PoN of 12 normals (including the case normal) at 100bp and denoised using bin medians only (i.e., `--number-of-eigensamples 0`) to avoid denoising away common events.

Deployability,"Interesting! Thanks for generating these. I am already convinced by #4519 we should at least switch over to a ‘CollectReadCounts’ strategy for initial evaluations. A few comments:. -I’m guessing that the equal insert size and uniform sampling is enhancing many of these artifacts to a level that we probably don’t see in the real world. Can we take a look at some real-world examples?. -Same goes for the fact that homs will be unlikely. -Not sure about the dropouts. Might be worth running without SNPs as a confounding factor. -How flexible is SVGen? Might be worth putting together a more realistic simulated data set. Any chance @MartonKN might be able to use it to cook up some realistic tumor data?. -I don’t recall having a `CollectBaseCallCoverage` type tool in beta—which tool are you thinking of? On a related note, it seems there is some demand to port `DepthOfCoverage` from GATK3. However, I’d prefer that we roll a CNV-specific version of the tool even if it does get ported. In any case, I think along with findings from the other issue, we should issue a quick PR for `CollectReadCounts` and go ahead to change the `CollectCounts` WDL task to call it—it’s for this very reason that the task is named generically! @sooheelee note that we may have to update the tutorials, etc. at some point, but perhaps the right time will be until all evaluations are more complete. Speaking of which, this PR should not delay getting the first round of automated evaluations up and running. Again, the whole point of those is to have a reproducible baseline metric against which we can easily experiment with and adopt these sorts of changes.

Given this issue, and the unrelated but evolving requirement that we have more than a single conda yml (we need a separate one with the intel tensorflow version that supports acceleration on intel hardware), I'm going to make the following changes:. Add a single conda template and a gradle task that generates the two (nearly but not quite identical) yml files as part of the build. These will be stored in the build directory with the python package archive, so the yml file no longer has to specify a path to the zip (which we previously had to strip when we included the file in the zip/tar distribution). The zip and yml files will be copied into the tar/zip distributions as was previously done.; Add a gradle target that creates/updates the local conda dev. This is for local use by devs during iterative development.

The parentheses are confounding but not relevant - the failing case above that uses no parens references `MQRandSum` (sic); the succeeding case references `MQRankSum`. Separating the expression components into separate filter expression arguments **does** change the results because each expression is evaluated individually and serially, so a reference to a missing value in one expression results in a `PASS`, but the subsequent expression results in the filter being applied if it meets the criteria.

For example, suppose we have a ref haplotype ABCDD, where A, B, and C represent sequences of, say, 100 bases and D is a sequence of 50 bases. Suppose further that A and DD are the padding. Then the cigar of an alt haplotype ABCD gets aligned as a 350 base match that doesn't span the full padded reference region, leading to the error. I still need to figure out why this didn't happen in 4.1.4 (my guess is that elsewhere the code effectively skipped these haplotypes before the exception).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6533#issuecomment-607059533:18,patch,patch,18,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6533#issuecomment-607059533,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,It should also be noted that the current behavior of the HaplotypeCaller on low base quality reads could be better. Specifically in the PairHMM there is code that explicitly caps the base qualities for every base in every read to be at most the reads Mapping Quality. Empirically this doesn't seem to sufficiently penalize low MQ reads in the HMM scores which is part of the reason for the hard cuttoff. In the upcoming DRAGEN-GATK release code we disable this particular behavior and instead apply a secondary genotyping algorithm in the genotyper that attempts to partition the evidence by mapping quality and adjust the score if there is a significant difference in MQ between reads supporting the various alleles. No doubt there could be other approaches for capping MQ (possibly a reads HMM likelihoods contribution can be capped based on its MQ as well which is also a part of the DRAGEN-GATK).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7034#issuecomment-758861915:432,release,release,432,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7034#issuecomment-758861915,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Java implementation of segmentation is now in the sl_wgs_segmentation dev branch, with a few simple unit tests. I'll expand on these and add tests for denoising in the future, but for now we have a working revised pipeline up through segmentation. The CLI is simply named ModelSegments (since my thinking is that it could eventually replace ACNV). I ran it on some old denoised exomes. Runtime is <10s, comparable to CBS. Here's a particularly noisy exome:. CBS found 1398 segments:; ![cbs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/30165095-cdf6251a-93ac-11e7-91fb-dcc8f48fe07f.png). Kernel segmentation with a penalty given by a = 1, b = 0 found 1018 segments:; ![kern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/30165106-dbbe0b40-93ac-11e7-99ec-5d58d8417d8b.png). Kernel segmentation with a penalty given by a = b = 1 (which is probably a reasonable default penalty, at least based on asymptotic theoretical arguments) reduced this to 270 segments :; ![kern-smooth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/30165113-e2b545a8-93ac-11e7-97a9-a692e43ebbdf.png). The number of segments can similarly be controlled in WGS. WGS runtime is ~7min for 250bp bins, ~30s of which is TSV reading, and there is one more spot in my implementation that could stand a bit of optimization, which might bring the runtime down. In contrast, I kicked off CBS 45 minutes ago, and it's still running... @LeeTL1220 this is probably ready to hand off to you for some WDL writing and preliminary evaluation. ; Although I can't guarantee that there aren't bugs, I ran about ~80 exomes with no problem.

That tool fails early if the output directory is not writeable or does not exist, and although there is a code path later that suggests that output directories should be created, it is not reached due to this early fail. It might be that this inconsistency was introduced in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1208 and I did not catch it in my PR review. @yfarjoun any opinions what the intended behavior should be? Are there any conventions for Picard tools in general?. Perhaps we could enforce this at the engine level (maybe checks that are triggered by annotations such as suggested in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/141, if possible)?

For the pipeline there is no reason not to allow this empty interval and consequent empty output because it gets merged with other output later in the pipeline. It also seems that this is a generic feature of scattered jobs -- empty intersection of intervals need not imply a user error. Therefore, I added an argument to `IntervalArgumentCollection` to allow empty intervals.

I understand that it is defined in the specs but is it critical for the functioning, if we assume that each sample is one library? ; In my case, I was following a pipeline involving `STAR` mapping -> `MarkDuplicates` -> `SplitNCigarReads` -> `HaplotypeCaller`. As I understand, normally I should have added `@RG`s at the mapping step. Neither `MarkDuplicates` nor `SplitNCigarReads` gave any warning about it, so I only figured the problem at the final step.

We aim for all documentation to be complete by December 14. It's possible we will organize the forum tool documentation to mirror that of this categorization. There was talk today in a meeting with the engine team that we should propose multiple categorizations, for the (much later, not upcoming release) possibility for listing tools based on user preference, e.g. by functional category or by input file type. So any work you do towards categorization could be useful down the road. . Here are some questions that were raised during the meeting:; - GATK vs Picard should be separate. One reason is because the standard arguments are different.; - The categories within each program would mirror.; - Consistent categorization. Last I checked, CNV tools were listed in its own category while other tools appear organized by input file type. Because we need to also ensure every tool (excepting Spark and BWA) has a summary description and example command, it would be useful for documentation purposes at least, to have functional categories that take the same or related inputs, e.g. any type of interval list (BED, Picard style or GATK), so that we can group testing of the tool commands and there is minimal context switching.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706:71,update,updated,71,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706,2,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Let's discuss further before you get too far along. The design of the Collections code was intended to ensure that very strict file formats are adhered to within the CNV pipeline. Making it more flexible to accommodate TSVs with arbitrary column headers, relax requirements for sequence dictionaries, etc. undermines that goal. There are also two other issues to consider:. 1) It looks like @jonn-smith has also been putting considerable effort into building a TSV framework for Funcotator. Perhaps CombineSegmentBreakpoints should consider using that framework instead, if it is more appropriate. We can also discuss bringing the CNV pipeline over into that framework, but this should definitely wait until after release. The end goal is for CNV team to spend as little time as possible writing or maintaining any code related to TSV parsing. 2) @mbabadi has put together some python evaluation code for the new gCNV, which makes use of the IntervalTree python package and PyVCF to accomplish some things that are very similar to what CombineSegmentBreakpoints is doing. Perhaps we could implement a similar approach purely in Java by making use of the IntervalTree implementation in htsjdk. I think for now we should treat CombineSegmentBreakpoints as a one-off tool to be used for internal validations. After release, we should design a more generic evaluation tool. This tool could take as input multiple collections of annotated locatables, with a few rigidly defined formats allowed (e.g., VCF, CNV Collection TSVs, perhaps some TSVs from other tools, etc.), with one designated as ground truth. The regions for evaluation could also be specified via -L (since it is possible this might not completely specified by the ground-truth collection). The appropriate intersections and lookups could then be performed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3995#issuecomment-352860616:170,pipeline,pipeline,170,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3995#issuecomment-352860616,4,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipeline', 'release']"

I would say that these samples are exactly matching in terms of their VCFeval output and thus we can be confident that this branch did not break the standard pipeline path and we can call this 👍. ```; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --; SNP | 0.9706 | 0.9863 | 0.9784 | 3473278 | 3489284 | 105213 | 48308 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 539662 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; INDEL | 0.8814 | 0.8636 | 0.8724 | 485076 | 465627 | 65264 | 73548 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 429205 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; SNP | 0.9743 | 0.99 | 0.9821 | 3384890 | 3391796 | 89358 | 34303 | HCR | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297:353,pipeline,pipeline,353,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Looks like this failed on travis. I think given that given the lateness of the hour (release wise), we might want to take the original change that removes the libgcc-ng dependency, since that passed on travis, and rely on the simple workarounds for osx, which we'll have to convey out-of-band.

Hi,. I created a conda environment and installed gatk4 through `conda install -c bioconda gatk4`. I have been using this environment to run all steps of the single sample germline variant calling best practices workflow (both gatk and picard). However, I have never been able to run CNNScoreVariants with this setup, as it always results in a java.lang.NullPointerException error. The only way I am able to run this step is by running it through the docker image you provide. That, however, is not ideal for our setup. Any idea as to what I may try to be able to run it directly?.

This is a straightforward port of that version with minimal changes:. -Merged ""MWUnitTest"" and ""RankSumUnitTest"" from GATK3 into a single; test class MannWhitneyUUnitTest; -Ported MathUtils.binomialCoefficient() and wrote new test for it; -Updated RankSumTest class and tests as appropriate.

Deployability,"Many of the pull requests are not using [`CommandLineProgramTest.runCommandLine()`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/blob/c6b41e6da8c9ea3f03206a25ce4ad74312b154f0/src/test/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/CommandLineProgramTest.java). I'm assuming this is because we have not settled on a way to `Assert` that outputs are similar after running a hellbender command line. This issue should resolve with a definition how far one should test before a pull request is accepted. After an arbitrary low level patch to the codebase, I believe the GATK [`MD5DB`](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/3b67b448072e24c80779b2e1cbc9dcfcb5dce4cf/public/gatk-tools-public/src/test/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/utils/MD5DB.java) and [`DiffEngine`](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/3b67b448072e24c80779b2e1cbc9dcfcb5dce4cf/public/gatk-tools-public/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/engine/walkers/diffengine/DiffEngine.java) are considered too hard to verify-and-update en masse. This limitation would also apply to external framework test utilities, such as TestNG's `FileAssert.assertLength()`. A 2009 discussion of file comparators is archived [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/466841/comparing-text-files-w-junit). Ultimately, I believe the biggest pain point with the `MD5DB` is that there does not exist a quick way to a) diagnose what has changed and b) to then update all hundreds of expected outputs. As in `DiffEngine`, we could define a way to regression test that only certain aspects of common file types aren't changing (exact number of reads in BAMs, or exact number of variants in BCF), or that values are falling within a certain range (number of quality scores all above 30 under 60), etc. As for updating results, instead of embedding the expected `MD5DB` outputs in a hundreds of java test files, one could also externalize _all_ of the expected outputs to another file (json, flat text, etc.) such that this singular sorted file for the entire test suite may be updated ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/69:511,patch,patch,511,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/69,2,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'update']"

Deployability,"Moving to [GenomicsDB 1.4.1 ](https://github.com/GenomicsDB/GenomicsDB/releases/tag/v1.4.1)release will allow for the direct use of the native GCS C++ client instead of the GCS Cloud Connector via HDFS. The GCS Cloud Connector can still be used with GenomicsDB via the `--genomicsdb-use-gcs-hdfs-connector` option. Using the native client with gcs allows for GenomicsDB to use the standard paradigms to help with authentication, retries with exponential backoff, configuring credentials, etc. The defaults are all hardcoded to match what is in gatk at present. It also helps with performance issues with gcs, see #7070. This version also contains fixes for #7089, although it will require additional support from gatk(will be part of a separate PR).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7224:71,release,releases,71,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7224,2,['release'],"['release', 'releases']"

Deployability,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:1118,configurat,configuration,1118,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"My first idea was to port it to ReadTools (that's why I asked to change it to the public code when GATK3 was divided into the non-free version and the plan was not to port indel-realignment). Nevertheless, someone showed interest into this and that's why I did this PRs; in addition, it is much better than the original authors (if still at Broad) can contribute to see if the port is correct. Anyway, I don't have any strong feeling about this, and I can always port the pipeline to ReadTools and maintain it there (actually, I had some ideas for other realignment methods and it will be interesting to compare with this). @cmnbroad - this was a long time ago, when even some of the standards (documentation and kebab-case arguments) were not even implemented. Regarding the tests, the last commit includes one using a BAM file in the repository, and the output was generated with GATK3 (if I remember correctly, although I can't remember the version). I think that the best way to go is to re-open a PR to have a cleaner history and proper standards. The idea will be:. 1. Copy of the GATK3 files (from the latest release); 2. Reformat (license and coding-style); 3. Port to the new framework.; 4. Convert documentation and arguments to the GATK4 format; 5. Add tests by running the latest GATK3 release on data in the repository and checking concordance. If a different dataset should be used for the tests, it will be nice if you can provide some. Otherwise, I will use data in the repository (b37_reference_20_21 and NA12878_20_21_WGS_bam)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763:472,pipeline,pipeline,472,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763,3,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipeline', 'release']"

Deployability,"Need some guidance here. The CompareSAMs tool was not propagating the validation stringency. I have a fix for that, but that alone doesn't fix the compareBAMFiles test in BaseRecalibrationIntegrationTest.java, since that uses SamAssertionUtils.assertSamsEqual, which also doesn't propagate (or accept) a validation stringency. Changing SamAssertionUtils to use either SILENT or LENIENT does fix the integration test, and all the other tests pass, but it seems like a relaxing of the stringency, and I'm not sure it should be necessary to the BQSR test. If relaxing the stringency for BQSR test _IS_ the right path, one possibility is to add a new method to SamAssertionUtils that accepts a validation stringency argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266:399,integrat,integration,399,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"Next I set out to determine whether hellbender is slowing down on the larger interval simply because there is more data / a longer traversal, or because it's slower at processing the `1:1-10000000` interval than the `1:10000000-20000000` interval. And surprisingly, it appears that the latter is the case:. Time to process the `1:1-10000000` interval across two runs:. ```; GATK3: 5m25.983s 5m31.913s; HB: 6m2.156s 5m59.804s; ```.

Deployability,"No - you should use GenomicsDB as the input to GenotypeGVCFs. My suggestion to use SelectVariants was only a debugging step to check whether GenomicsDB included the expected input data. Also, I misread your original post -- your GVCFs have literally 109 sites? And the interval list/bed file has 109 sites, not 109 regions? I would strongly recommend using a single interval in that case. Having a subfolder for each site will lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead. Lastly, I would recommend upgrading to a newer GATK. 4.1.8.0 is exactly 2 years old it seems...there's been quite a few changes/updates since then. edit: and to resolve why the number of subfolders in the workspace don't match the lines in the bed file -- my guess is that some of the sites in the bed file are abutting each other.

Deployability,"OK @droazen @davidbenjamin I think this is ready for review. Note that:. 1) I did not restore the optimization introduced by @davidbenjamin in #5466. Happy to file an issue to restore it later by adding the appropriate parameter check, if we think it's important.; 2) I only added integration tests for HC and M2, since there is only a minimal test for FilterAlignmentArtifacts at this time. But I would think that these tests are enough to show that the exposure preserves behavior (unless I somehow got extremely unlucky with the test data and parameter values...); 3) Apologies to the reviewer for the somewhat complicated commit history, which resulted from introducing/removing the TSV stuff and was more trouble than it might be worth to reorder/resolve in the final rebase. I think it would be easiest for the reviewer to look at the 4 ""bubbled up..."" commits separately when reviewing the exposure of each parameter set, but then look at the overall commit when reviewing more superficial things or the tests.; 4) I'd appreciate it if the reviewer double checked that I did not switch anything up in parameter names, doc strings, default values, etc. when introducing the 12 explicit args in AssemblyBasedCallerArgumentCollection.

Deployability,"OK so just following along; the problem appears related to the Google Cloud Storage Connector and its configuration. When running on Cloud we need to ask for the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write` scope, as described in [the install docs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigdata-interop/blob/master/gcs/INSTALL.md). But you're right that `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` should imply that so it should work... The command line argument is `--scopes` (plural) and not `--scope` but that's probably not the issue, the tool would have complained if you actually typed `scope` in there. .

Deployability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately. Here is the list of packages that get pulled in by the R install: ```autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils bsdmainutils build-essential; bzip2-doc cdbs cpp cpp-5 debhelper dh-strip-nondeterminism dh-translations; dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-5 gcc gcc-5 gettext gettext-base gfortran; gfortran-5 groff-base ifupdown intltool intltool-debian iproute2; isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libalgorithm-diff-perl; libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libarchive-zip-perl; libasan2 libasprintf-dev libasprintf0v5 libatm1 libatomic1; libauthen-sasl-perl libblas-common libblas-dev libblas3 libbz2-dev; libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libcroco3 libcurl3; libdns-export162 libdpkg-perl libencode-locale-perl libfakeroot; libfile-basedir-perl libfile-desktopentry-perl libfile-fcntllock-perl; libfile-listing-perl libfile-mimeinfo-perl libfile-stripnon",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954:45,install,install,45,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954,3,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"OK, I think things are looking good! Updated a bunch of things, including the following:. - conda 23.1.0 -> 23.10.0; in the base Docker, also disabled conda auto-updating and set the solver to the much faster libmamba (NOTE: before this PR went in, this change was actually made in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610); - python 3.6.10 -> 3.10.13; - pymc 3.1 -> 5.10.0; - theano 1.0.4 -> pytensor 2.18.1; - added pytorch 2.1.0; - removed tensorflow 1.15.0 and other CNN dependencies; - added libblas-dev to the base Docker; I think MKL versions of all packages are being used, but we should verify!. These and other packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) are all pretty much at the latest available versions for python 3.10. I've also bumped version numbers for our internal python packages. I also made all of the changes to the gCNV code to accommodate any changes introduced by PyMC/Pytensor. For the most part, these were minor renamings of `theano`/`tt`/etc. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors).

Deployability,"OK, looks like you can get around the compiler lock issues by pointing each invocation of GermlineCNVCaller to a different compilation directory. For example, invoke `gatk` by. `THEANORC=PATH/TO/THEANORC_# gatk GermlineCNVCaller ...`. This uses the `THEANORC` environment variable to set the `.theanorc` configuration file to `PATH/TO/THEANORC_#` for this instance of GATK (where you should fill in `#` appropriately). Each `PATH/TO/THEANORC_#` should be a file containing the following:. ````; [global]; base_compiledir = PATH/TO/COMPILEDIR_#; ````. Where again, `#` is filled in appropriately. The goal is to point each GermlineCNVCaller instance to a different compilation directory. @xysj1989 can you let me know if this works for you?. This is a bit of a hack. We could probably avoid this by changing the GATK code to use a specified or temporary directory for the theano directory without too much effort. However, there is an upside to using a non-temporary directory to avoid recompilation of the model upon subsequent runs. In this case, we'd just want to let the user be able to specify the theano directory (rather than dump things in `~/.theano` unexpectedly). We should think about whether this should be opt-in, i.e., should we preserve the original behavior of using `~/.theano` by default?. @mwalker174 opinions? @droazen or engine team, thoughts on what the policy should be for python/R scripts doing this sort of thing?

Deployability,"OK, relaxed the exact match to a delta of 1E-6 (chosen because doubles are formatted in somatic CNV outputs as `""%.6f""`) and tests pass on Travis (modulo an unrelated intermittent timeout failure). Note also that I was also able to reproduce locally by switching between Java 8 and 11. Had to add some quick test code for doing the comparisons; not actually sure if we have other utility methods to do so somewhere in the codebase. Another interesting note: I tried to clean up the offending use of log10factorial in AlleleFractionLikelihoods, but this introduced numerical differences at the ~1E-3 level. I think all of the round tripping between log and log10 actually adds up. Some digging revealed that this was introduced way back in gatk-protected in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/commit/aeec297e104db9f5196cb8f8e6691133302474bc#diff-34bd76cb2a416a212e25cbfb11298207265fb9cced775918aefcdb6b91ebc247. Despite the fact that we could easily replace the use of log10factorial with a private logGamma cache, at this point I think it makes more sense to freeze the current behavior.

Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr.

Deployability,"OK. Our pipelines currently all use gatk like you say. Our upstream code splits an operation (set of processing steps) into intervals and scatter/gathers across our slurm cluster. Other code then merges the output, which is usually a vcf. VariantQC (which is basically a fancy variant eval), cannot currently be split so easily, since it aggregates data across the genome. Another option I've toyed with is making a mode in which one could execute it over a set of intervals, and have each job write some intermediate output with the pre-aggregated data. I would make another step that aggregates these outputs. If there are any facilities that exist in gatk to support this type of scenario I'd appreciate pointers. .

Deployability,"On branch `ll_CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I have created a CLI called: `CollectAllelicCountsSpark` ... This tool will have the exact same functionality as `CollectAllelicCounts`, to the point where I can re-use the integration tests. However, the integration tests fail. When I dig deeper in `CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I see that only 8 RDDs (correct amount: 11) are being passed to processAlignments... Consider the following code:. ```; @Override; protected void processAlignments(JavaRDD<LocusWalkerContext> rdd, JavaSparkContext ctx) {; final String sampleName = SampleNameUtils.readSampleName(getHeaderForReads());; final SampleMetadata sampleMetadata = new SimpleSampleMetadata(sampleName);; final Broadcast<SampleMetadata> sampleMetadataBroadcast = ctx.broadcast(sampleMetadata);. final AllelicCountCollector finalAllelicCountCollector =; rdd.mapPartitions(distributedCount(sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue(), minimumBaseQuality)); .reduce((a1, a2) -> combineAllelicCountCollectors(a1, a2, sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue()));; final List<LocusWalkerContext> tmp = rdd.collect();; ....snip....; ```. In this case `tmp` will have a size of 8. However, the integration test would indicate a size of 11 is correct, since 11 intervals are being passed in. Note that `emitEmptyLoci()` returns `true`, so 11 is the correct number as seen in `CollectAllelicCountsSparkIntegrationTest` . . Additionally, in (at least) one result, the counts are wrong. `CollectAllelicCounts` (non-spark) passes the integration test. I have tried a couple of tests to gather more information:. - Is `emitEmptyLoci()` causing an issue? ; Does not appear to be causing the issue. I say this because when set to `false`, I get (essentially) the same error.; - The code uses `mapPartition` and not `map`, does this cause the issue?

Deployability,"Oof, that's a nasty problem. We can definitely do something about it. It feels more like a Microsoft bug than a GATK one though. It seems crazy that each layer pull has to be a separate web request and there's no batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things.

Deployability,"Our R dependency is primarily for producing plots. It could be possible to create plots using javascript instead. Javascript plots have several potential advantages but also several major downsides. The biggest and most obvious drawback is that we don't have any code to produce them yet, and they are likely harder to generate and experiment with than R scripts. . The advantage would be that we could avoid requiring an R installation to run hellbender scripts, we could potentially also include interactive plotting or other neat tricks to make the plots more useful. I see 2 possible routes to replacing Rscripts with javascript. The first would be for tools that require graphs to perform some html generation and produce html reports with embedded javascript. The user could then open these in their browser and view the plots ( much like how our test suite report and jacoco is done). . A different option would be to use javascript plotting libraries directly within the jvm to generate SVG. Java 8 has a new javascript engine which is supposed to be reasonably fast and offers access to java objects from within it. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a full DOM like a browser does, so most existing javascript libraries will fall over. It seems like it would take a lot of hacking to get something like d3 to run directly on the jvm. (someone has done something of the kind here: http://jazdw.net/content/server-side-svg-generation-using-d3js) . Other options would be to use the javafx web panes to display a browser directly, or to plot directly on a canvas.

Since the orientation bias annotation and filter are only standard in Mutect2 we weren't expecting it to cause problems for HaplotypeCaller users.

While changing the annotation name was not absolutely necessary we felt it was important because the OxoG artifact is only one example of an artifact with orientation bias. As of 2012 or so it was the best-known such artifact but the name is now misleading.

Deployability,"Posting at the suggetion of shlee. There's discussion about what parts of VariantEval will be ported to GATK4 or whether Picard's partially overlapping tool CollectVariantCallingMetrics will take this over. I want to at least make you aware that we've developed a tool we're calling VariantQC, which is built in GATK3 and runs VariantEval internally to generate data stratified in various ways to make HTML QC reports, sorta like FASTQC or MultiQC (https://github.com/bbimber/gatk-protected/releases). An example report is here: https://prime-seq.ohsu.edu/_webdav/Internal/Bimber/Public/%40files/VariantQC_Example.html. Our goal was always to port this to GATK4, polish it up, and then make it more generally available. Much of what this tool does is take the pre-built tables/reports from VariantEval and put them into HTML, but we also wrote some custom stratifications to bin data by filter, etc. Like this thread notes, VariantEval has a lot of features not in picard, and honestly we dont use many of them. However, the extensibility of Stratifier/VariantEvaluator are pretty important for us. . We realize this is prioritized against all the GATK4 features; however, 1) how set are plans about migration of VariantEval/merge w/ picard and 2) if most of VariantEval isnt going to be ported, can we pick it up in our repo? We could also potentially offer some assistance in porting the tool because we have a vested interest; however, unless the task is defined as porting VariantEval as close as possible to as-is (not that this is critical, but it's the simplest thing for the outsider to do), it would need some discussion around exactly what's planned.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-320737252:491,release,releases,491,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-320737252,1,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls performs a check of the denoising/calling hyperparameter configs used to generate the model in GermlineCNVCaller cohort mode against those used to generate the case-mode result passed to PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. However, although some of these hyperparameters are not exposed in case mode (since they have no effect on the sample-level parameters inferred in case mode, e.g., `psi_t_scale`), their python default values are nevertheless written to the case-mode config. I think that this results in a spurious mismatch between the cohort/case mode configs, which causes PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to emit the following warnings in case mode when non-default values are used:. ````; WARNING gcnvkernel.postprocess.viterbi_segmentation - Different denoising configuration between model and calls -- proceeding at your own risk!; WARNING gcnvkernel.postprocess.viterbi_segmentation - Different calling configuration between model and calls -- proceeding at your own risk!; ````. I'm pretty sure that inference is actually performed correctly, but we may want to double check and clean up these warnings. We should probably just copy the non-exposed values from the model config on the python side when running GermlineCNVCaller in case mode. Not sure if there's any way to emit sensible warnings on the Java side. These hyperparameters are still exposed to the Java command line in case mode, they just aren't passed on to the python command line. So the user can change their values from their engine defaults without having any effect at all, but this is probably what we want. Perhaps we can document, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6994:789,configurat,configuration,789,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6994,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,Prevents a bug that occurs when a file path contains characters that are illegal in URIs. Specific example was when using `--tmp-dir file:///tmp/workflow#main` GATK would initially correctly interpret this as `/tmp/workflow#main` but then when setting the Java temp directory in `CommandLineProgram.java` line 164 it would send `/tmp/workflow#main` to `IOUtils.getAbsolutePathWithoutFileProtocol` which would then mangle it by turning it into a URI and then removing `file://` resulting in `/tmp/workflow%23main` which later causes issues when things like the Codecs attempt to write configuration files to the temp directory that doesn't exist.

Deployability,"PyMC was updated from Theano (think of this as an old alternative to TensorFlow) to Aesara.; > 9. Since then, PyMC 5.9 has been released and the underlying backend has been updated again, from Aesara to PyTensor.; > 10. So if we are going to update the environment to support Python 3.10+, it probably makes sense to go all the way to PyMC 5.9. I've made some strides in this PR; as of [6b08f3a](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561/commits/6b08f3af205cb9af1f5c63a0786f9a5a52cd78c1), I've made enough updates to accommodate API changes so that cohort-mode inference for both GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy runs successfully under Python 3.10 and PyMC 5.9.0---although note that 5.9.1 has been released in the interim!. However, our work has just begun. Results now produced in the numerical tests mentioned above are quite far off from the original expected results. It remains to be seen whether this is due to the randomness of inference, some slight changes to the model prior that were necessitated by the API changes, or some bugs introduced in other code updates. (Also note that I believe Andrey's PR in item 4 already broke these tests, although the numerical differences were much smaller and more reasonable---but perhaps he can confirm. Also noting here that I think determinism is still currently broken as of this commit---there have been some changes to PyTensor/PyMC seeding so that our previous theano/PyMC3 hack no longer applies.). So I think the next step is to just go to scientific-level testing and see what the fallout is. Ideally, we'd still get good performance (or perhaps better! at least on the runtime side, hopefully...) and we can just update the numerical tests. But if performance tanks, then we might need to see whether I've introduced any bugs. @mwalker174 @asmirnov239 perhaps you can comment on what might be the appropriate test suite here----1kGP?.

Deployability,"Reads` from Mutect2 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/mutect/SomaticGenotypingEngine.java#L326); - separate consideration of overlapping reads when calculating genotype likelihoods, as used in UnifiedGenotyper (https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk-protected/blob/aa8764d6c3de146856b174a8674fa787a6311d7c/protected/gatk-tools-protected/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/tools/walkers/genotyper/DiploidSNPGenotypeLikelihoods.java#L183). As I see it, #4958, which seems to be more related to read likelihood calculation, is where a more involved solution, with more fundamental changes, might be warranted. From my perspective (not being especially familiar with the pairHMM model), an ideal solution would transition the pairHMM from read likelihood to a ""fragment likelihood"" or ""haplotype likelihood"" when information from read pairs is available, even if they aren't overlapping. The idea would be that a modified pairHMM model could produce a single fragment (or haplotype) likelihood for a given read pair. Such an approach would unify the issues of ""merging"" read pairs and phasing in a read-pair aware manner (and potentially also modeling PCR errors). In principle, a ""fragment likelihood""-type approach could even incorporate info from corresponding PCR duplicates to improve the results when sequencing error rates are high. This sort of approach could also flow into the genotype likelihood calculation by providing a single, merged fragment likelihood to consider rather than a separate read likelihood for each read. UPDATE: On further thought, it probably wasn't a good idea for me to use the terms fragment likelihood or haplotype likelihood to distinguish the proposed approach, since the read likelihood is effectively already calculating those. Probably a better term would be ""read set likelihood"", where the read set would consist of paired reads and potentially also any corresponding PCR duplicate reads.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420:2682,UPDATE,UPDATE,2682,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420,1,['UPDATE'],['UPDATE']

Deployability,"Report; ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); HaplotypeCaller --max-reads-per-alignment-start. ### Affected version(s); - [x] Latest public release version [4.1.2.0]; - [ ] Latest master branch as of [date of test?]. ### Description; We used GATK4 to detect a fairly large duplication (60bp) in a control sample. We did sequenced two replicates for this sample, one having significantly more coverage than the other.With default GATK4 parameter the duplication was only detected in the sample with the lowest coverage. After inspection of GATK4 parameter we found that it was the downsampling throught the --max-reads-per-alignment-start that was in cause.Indeed, all the reads that contains the duplications are softcliped (see IGV capture below) because the insertion/duplication event is too bigged to be correctly aligned by BWA. This causes all reads containing the duplication to have the same start position in the BAM file. Then, the downsampling based on start position must drastically reduce the signal and the variant is skipped. This explains why the variant was missed at high coverage level and not in the replicates with lower signal.We think that the downsampling should take Softclips into account to be more reliable, but maybe you have a better idea.Also we did some performance evaluation and GATK4 runned faster with the downsampling desactivated. Is it normal ?; ![duplication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53903734/62783152-17f41180-babc-11e9-9ddb-bed3c3042d97.png). #### Steps to reproduce; Run GATK4 with default parameters on the BAM containing the duplication (we can provide a toy). Disable --max-reads-per-alignment-start by switching the value to 0 to enable the identification of the duplication. #### Expected behavior; The duplication should have been found because the downsampling on start position does not take into accout the reads softclips. #### Actual behavior; The duplication is missed at high coverage depth",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6088:137,release,release,137,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6088,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Same here, @jhl667 - good to get additional confirmation. May I ask whether you used the same gold-standard call set or another one, and whether yours was WGS or WES? . I’m linking @droazen here as well since he acted as the release manager of the affected releases. I think it would be good to get clarity soon, since probably tens of thousands of clinical samples have been processed with the affected versions in the last two years, and a reduction in precision of 10-20% (absolute) may have been relevant for clinical decisions in at least some of these cases. Also, I know how hard it is to avoid such things in what is essentially research software (and such a great one to boot), so this is not about blaming anyone but about fixing the root cause as soon as possible. If it turns out that the issue only affects this particular reference call set and no patients (for some arcane reason), then all the better in my view.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1171653305:225,release,release,225,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1171653305,2,['release'],"['release', 'releases']"

Deployability,"Since you asked, I have a couple of thoughts:. First, I don't know if allowing the SAMRecord header to be set to null ; something that was intended to be widely used, or whether it was an ; oversight in the API or done to solve some particular corner case. If ; many SAMRecord methods appear to be broken if the header is null, then ; perhaps this isn't something that was intended for wide use. Second, it sounds like the suggestion is that headerless SAMRecords ; would now be widely used, and thus a common thing that people writing ; code against htsjdk need to anticipate.; So if you go this way you should update the SAMRecord documentation to ; clearly indicate that SAMRecords can be in either a headerless or ; non-headerless (headerful?) state; and indicate how each API function is affected by this. If certain ; methods behave differently, then people writing code against SAMRecord ; need to anticipate this; and existing code may need to be updated. In other words, headerless ; SAMRecords should become ""part of the spec"". Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and com",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141451518:612,update,update,612,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141451518,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

When looking into this a little with James and Louis earlier, we realized that the code for setting up the ActiveRegionGenotyper uses a weird partial copy of the standard CLI args method that has existed in the code for whoever knows how long. Conceptually this seems like a bad idea, but changing it now would possibly cause some older tests to fail, if they were based on this faulty method reasoning. Should we try to merge the PR as it is now, with all tests passing, and hopefully consistency with previous behavior, or try to update the logic around this genotyper as well at the same time?

If you change it to a fully specified path i.e. `/Users/louisb/Workspace/gatk/testoutput.bam` then it works as expected.

Added segmentation classes and tests for ModelSegments CNV pipeline.; -I added implementations of copy-ratio, allele-fraction, and ""multidimensional"" (joint) segmentation. All implementations are pretty boilerplate; they simply partition by contig and then call out to KernelSegmenter. Note that there is some logic in multidimensional segmentation that only uses the first het in each copy-ratio interval and if any are available, and imputes the alt-allele fraction to 0.5 if not.; -Makes sense for @mbabadi to review this, since he reviewed the KernelSegmenter PR. Added modeling classes and tests for ModelSegments CNV pipeline.; -Most of this code is copied from the old MCMC code. However, I've done some overall code cleanup and refactoring, especially to remove some overextraction of methods in the allele-fraction likelihoods (see #2860). I also added downsampling and scaling of likelihoods to cut down on runtime. Tests have been simplified and rewritten to use simulated data.; -@LeeTL1220 do you think you could take a look?.

Deployability,"Some preliminary evaluation of the new ModelSegments pipeline on CRSP samples has revealed some weaknesses of the ReCapSeg caller (which is simply ported from the old pipeline) to me. I think there are a lot of confusing things going on:. 1) For determining copy-neutral segments, all segments with log2 mean below some threshold are used (rather than absolute log2). There is a comment that this is done to ""mimic the python code"" but I have no idea why this would be sensible, since it includes all deletions.; 2) There is some confusion arising from inconsistent use of z-score and T-statistic. Standard deviation, rather than standard error, is used for calling; i.e., a ""called segment"" is one that has a mean log2 copy ratio that has a z-score above some threshold with respect to the standard deviation of the log2 copy ratios of intervals that fall within copy-neutral segments (note also that these intervals have already been filtered by z-score to remove outliers). That is, any segment with a mean that falls sufficiently within the fuzziness of the caterpillar is not called.; 3) However, even calling using standard error is probably not what we want. This would simply be asking the question: given a population of copy-neutral intervals with a mean and standard deviation, does any non-copy-neutral segment contain intervals with a mean significantly different than the population? We've already answered this question during segmentation!. I think what we want to do instead is ask questions about the population of segment-level copy-ratio estimates, weighted by length.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3825:53,pipeline,pipeline,53,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3825,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

For example the SV detection pipeline collects read counts at 100bp intervals. In a 3.2Gbp genome that is roughly 30M entries. Easily a text interval_list in its simplest form would need around 30ch for each interval that bump it up to 900MB .

Deployability,"Sorry, I guess I didn't see your edit pointing out that line of code. I've indeed looked at that test and more---there's a lot of similar duct tape and inconsistent resetting of the RNG throughout the entire test suite. But since I think we can reasonably assume that there's enough duct tape to make things deterministic overall, I don't think it's worth cleaning up the duct tape just to get neater, but equally deterministic behavior. (Or perhaps can you point to instances of persisting non-determinism, e.g. random failures in Travis?). In any case, I think it makes more sense to focus effort on making cleaner tests for the new tools, rather than make an 11th hour effort to revamp these existing tests. Do you agree?. See e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6112 for some related discussion.

Deployability,"Still not sure why the tests failed randomly! all XHMM-related tests use their own RNG with fixed seeds and there are no RNG calls in any parallel streams. Therefore, the randomly generated test data must be identical and fully deterministic across all runs. However, it did not appear to be the case! some test runs triggered a bug in HMMPostProcessor (see below) and some runs didn't. I removed a few unnecessary RNGs and the issue is not reproducible anymore. In particular, both XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator had their own RNG but then again, if the tests are run in a deterministic order, it shouldn't matter. The good news is the bug in HMMPostProcessor is fixed; the bad news is, I still don't know why the tests were not deterministic. I bet the failing issue is (magically!) fixed as a result of pulling out the RNG from XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator. If it occurs again, I'll investigate more. - fixed a bug in HMMPostProcessor that required all samples to be queried in the given list of genotyping segments every time (origin of the failing tests: sometimes the randomly generated genotyping segments contained fewer samples than all samples available for genotyping); - got rid of the unnecessary RNG in XHMMModel to make it stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - also made XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - truncated the target list used in XHMM integration tests (cuts down the test time by a factor of 10)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140:1455,integrat,integration,1455,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"Summary information about this bug:. This issue affects GATK versions 4.3.0.0 through 4.5.0.0, and is fixed in GATK 4.6.0.0. The PR with the fix is: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8900. This issue also affects Picard versions 2.27.3 through 3.1.1, and is fixed in Picard 3.2.0. This bug is triggered when writing a CRAM file using one of the affected GATK/Picard versions, and both of the following conditions are met:; ; * At least one read is mapped to the very first base of a reference contig; * The file contains more than one CRAM container (10,000 reads) with reads mapped to that same reference contig. When both of these conditions are met, the resulting CRAM file may have corrupt containers associated with that contig containing reads with an incorrect sequence. . Since many common references such as hg38 have N's at the very beginning of the autosomes and X/Y, many pipelines will not be affected by this bug. However, users of a telomere-to-telomere reference, users doing mitochondrial calling, and users with reads aligned to the alt sequences will want to scan their CRAM files for possible corruption. The other mitigating circumstance is that when a CRAM is affected, the signal will be overwhelmingly obvious, with the mismatch rate typically jumping from sub-1% to 80-90% for the affected regions, making it likely to be caught by standard QC processes. A CRAM scanning tool called `CRAMIssue8768Detector` that can detect whether a particular CRAM file is affected by this bug was added in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8819, and was released as part of GATK 4.6.0.0",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8768#issuecomment-2198315437:894,pipeline,pipelines,894,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8768#issuecomment-2198315437,2,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipelines', 'released']"
Deployability,"Summary of changes:. - Fixed a minor issue in sampling error estimation that could lead to NaN (as a result of division by zero). - Introduced separate _internal_ and _external_ admixing rates. The _internal_ admixing rate is to be used internally by discrete RV posterior update routines (""callers"") as a safety measure to stabilize self-consistency loops. For example, consider the mean-field treatment of two coupled Markov chains: the mean-field decoupling of the two chains yields two independent Markov chains with effective emission, transition, and prior probabilities, all of which must be self-consistency determined. The internal admixing rate would be used to admix the old and new self-consistent fields across the two chains in order to dampen oscillations and improve convergence properties. Once internal convergence is achieved, the converged posteriors must be saved to a workspace in order to be consumed by the continuous sub-model. The new internally converged posteriors will be admixed with the old internally converged posteriors from the previous epoch with the _external_ admixing rate. - Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling. In the first (""warm-up"") stage, discrete variables are marginalized out, yielding an effective continuous-only model. The warm-up stage calculates continuous posteriors based on the marginalized model. Once convergence is achieved, continuous and discrete variables are decoupled for the second (""main"") stage. The second stage starts with a discrete calling step (crucial), using continuous posteriors from the warm-up stage as the starting point. The motivation behind the two-stage inference strategy is to avoid getting trapped in spurious local minima that are potentially introduced by mean-field decoupling of discrete and continuous RVs. Note that mean-field decoupling has a tendency to stabilize local minima, most of which will disappear or turn into saddle points once correlations are taken into account.

Deployability,"Support for incrementally adding samples to existing genomicsdb workspaces. I've added these comments to the docs, but just wanted to call out again that we recommend making a backup of the existing workspace before trying to update the workspace. Otherwise, if the incremental update fails the workspace may be in a corrupted/inconsistent state. . If the user chooses not to backup (or can't), there is a (somewhat painful, manual) way to restore the workspace on failure IFF the --consolidate option has not been used. The tool will output a backup callset file (suffixed .inc.backup) and a file suffixed .fragmentlist with a list of all the original fragments. In order to roll back to a consistent workspace, the user must; - replace the callset file in the workspace with the one suffixed .inc.backup.

Deployability,"Thank you @ddrichel! That's really helpful and seems to support my suspicion. The most relevant changes to Mutect2 between versions 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 are #6520, #6696, and #6821, which have in common the property that they are bug fixes restoring sensitivity in edge cases. I don't think that any of these are regressions because the job of Mutect2 is to output any candidate variant. Filtering is the responsibility of FilterMutectCalls. Because our panel of normals is generated by running Mutect2, a panel of normals generated before 4.1.9.0 is blind to artifacts that occur in these edge cases. I suspect that re-generating our panels of normals using a more recent release of Mutect2 will solve the problem. I'm going to need to see how long it will take to gather the samples to re-generate our hg38 panel of normals (it might not take long at all) and triage that against the timetable for Mutect3, which does away with the panel of normals entirely.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1203356531:672,release,release,672,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1203356531,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Thank you @kshakir. What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504:1105,configurat,configuration,1105,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

If you are waiting for this capability, I think you could probably write a small pipeline to modify the current output:. 1.

Split BAM into paired and unpaired read BAMs; 4. Feed these back into `PathSeqScoreSpark`. PathSeq currently removes all read tags - I have received requests in the past to fix this.

Deployability,"Thanks @clsgithubusr, we are well aware that Theano is no longer in development. There are plans to move future model implementations to pyro (https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro) and some prototype models have already been developed in that framework.

If you use the GATK conda environment you shouldn’t have any issues. If not, I don’t think we can make any guarantees. It was a major decision for us to introduce python ML frameworks into our codebase, but it was necessary to enable methods that can take advantage of all of the developments happening in the field of ML.

Deployability,"Thanks @droazen & @ldgauthier. I can certainly run a bunch more iterations of the same HC run on the same data. I'm not super hopeful it will turn anything up though. I can also try selecting a bunch of the different PairHMM implementations. I can't share too much, but this issue turned up in a very high throughput (1000s of samples a day) clinical pipeline. We're going back and looking for other instances where we see an excess of that `Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null` message, and re-running those samples to see if, on re-run, they generate different outputs. I realize the AVX-specific hardware issue is perhaps a little far-fetched, though given the volume of the pipeline and the fact that it runs in a cloud environment, I think it's entirely reasonable to suspect we'll run into hardware/instance issues occasionally. And there are AVX or at least SIMD specific registers, so if one of those were to see problems that could cause the PairHMM issues, without causing issues in other software that doesn't leverage the SIMD/AVX instructions. My main question really is this: is anyone familiar enough with the Intel PairHMM implementation and interface that they could weigh in on whether or not unexpected hardware errors could result in the return of empty likelihoods from the PairHMM instead of some kind of error, exception or segfault?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915:351,pipeline,pipeline,351,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Thanks @droazen. Because you assigned it to me, I would like to know a couple of details on how this should be implemented in GATK4:. * GATK3 use to have a the `MisencodedBaseQualityReadTransformer` always on, with a switch for checking/fixing the qualities. If we follow this approach in GATK, the only change for this is to include the checking step every n reads and then #2160 will do the rest. Nevertheles, I think that it's quite dangerous to allow an user to disable it with the plugin (because the name suggest that it is only fixing the qualities), so I suggest to integrate in the read data source an iterator for checking every x reads if the qualities are misencoded, independently on the transformer.; * GATK3 throws an UserException for ""putatively misencoded"" qualities, using 60 as maximum base quality for throwing. I think that in the case of GATK4 could be more useful to use a warning if it is over 60 (I do not know what is the reasoning behind this value), and use `SAMUtils.MAX_PHRED_SCORE` for throwing.

Deployability,"Thanks @kdatta. The branch builds now, but there are a couple of problems that cause several tests to fail, including some existing tests that used to pass. You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class. These aren't being used by the importer tool anyway.

Deployability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

This is Novaseq 2 x 150 data, I ran Fastqc on the reads and everything looks really good, the only thing I can find that might explain the soft-clipping is that there's some Nextera adapter read through on a small percentage of the reads. I haven't been using -Y with bwa (I see it's used in GATK 4 wdls), so it seems like there should be less soft-clipping than normal. I'll admit these are definitely messy regions we're dealing with, but we really need to make the F5 calls for our clinical pipeline.

I was trying to use a service account, rather than my personal account, using `gcloud auth activate-service-account`. This works for gcloud and gsutil commands, but doesn't seem to work with ADC very well evidently. Once I changed and used my personal account via `gcloud auth application-default login` GATK4 no longer gave that error. Then I found out that the file I gave you (which I picked because it's NA12878, but not where I originally found the problem) was not indexed. So I went back to using the original file which has `foo.vcf.gz` as well as `foo.vcf.gz.tbi`. GATK SelectVariants ran successfully. Finally, I spun up a GCE-vm which is running with the service account I want, installed Java and GATK4 and was able to run the command successfully.

Deployability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

I think that at least til that is solved, we could add a temporary solution to be able to use a consistent way of dealing with `File` and `java.nio.Path` user exceptions... What if I submit a PR to change all ctors to accept `java.nio.Path` instead of `File` in file-related `UserException`s? The `File.toPath()` will always work, but the `Path.toFile()` doesn't.

Deployability,"Thanks for these suggestions, @sooheelee. Note that there's already an issue filed to add `@PG` tags at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4117. As for the `@RG` tag, I was following the example of the SV team, which I saw introduced a custom RG ID (although this may only be used for tagging intermediate files---not sure?) Although not ideal, I think passing the sequence dictionary and sample name in this way allows us to reuse the relevant SAM header code and also prevents the possibility of users mixing up samples. (Recall that the old pipeline required the sample name to be passed in as a separate input to each tool and that no validation that each input came from the same sample was performed.). As for VCF output, we are also planning to add this to the ModelSegments pipeline (it is already in the gCNV pipeline). See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4114. However, I think it makes sense for this to wait until the improved caller is in.

Deployability,"Thanks for your answer @davidbenjamin. I still think that a javadoc update may be useful. If GATK is used as a framework and the user does not know that they should fill in all the likelihoods for all the alleles and reads, even without knowing about `PerReadAlleleLikelihoodMap`, this may drive to errors in the code that may be solved with a implementation note in the documentation.

Deployability,"Thanks for your feedback, @cmnbroad. In my case, I think that `IntegrationTestSpec` is a good way of avoid complicated code to test tool results, but it is true that it have some problems (one that I had was the usage for testing programs where the outputs are determined by a prefix in the command line, but with different suffixes). I think, from the API user point of view, that a class like `IntegrationTestSpec` to facilitate program output testing (including user exceptions) will be nice for developing purposes. Nevertheless, this is just a convenience that I asked for here, but I can try to solve the issues with the `BaseTest` instead. By the way, I would love to have this interface in GATK at least for now, because several of my tools rely on the `IntegrationTestSpecs` for development...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-243124889:63,Integrat,IntegrationTestSpec,63,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-243124889,3,['Integrat'],"['IntegrationTestSpec', 'IntegrationTestSpecs']"

Deployability,"Thanks for your question, @xysj1989. You are right that it can be advantageous to use SNP data for CNV calling. In my experience, however, it is not of high importance in practice. Indeed we do use BAF in our structural variation pipeline, but only for the purpose identifying high-quality calls. We typically find that BAF support tends to be weak/noisy for all but the largest CNVs, so requiring SNP evidence would greatly reduce sensitivity. @samuelklee can probably shed some more light on this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6407#issuecomment-581659408:230,pipeline,pipeline,230,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6407#issuecomment-581659408,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Thanks much for this. Unfortunately running as root isn't an option since external CWL runners (like bunny, Toil, cwltool and hopefully Cromwell soon) make the decisions about the username to use and will try to mirror the runner with the external user to match user permissions on the output files. Also people trust it more when you're not trying to run as root (hence, not wanting to mess with `/etc/passwd` in the Docker container for fix Spark as well). This was using the bcbio-vc Docker image (https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio_docker#docker-images) with gatk installed via bioconda, but I don't think is image specific unless you're specifically doing something in your images to work around the problem which is doesn't sound like.

We can delete it for the time being if you think it'll cause confusion.; - Correct, I think the import statement for `reshape` in BQSR.R was always incorrect/extraneous. `reshape2` is the correct dependency for `ggplot2` (which is itself imported), and `reshape` is not explicitly used in BQSR.R. So to recap: I removed the installation of this unnecessary package, but failed to remove an unnecessary import statement since it was in an untested code path, which was then caught when users tried to run the tool. Investigation of this issue then revealed that `ggplot2` was not installed correctly in the current base image, due to a completely unrelated dependency issue.; - Good call on clearing the Travis cache.
