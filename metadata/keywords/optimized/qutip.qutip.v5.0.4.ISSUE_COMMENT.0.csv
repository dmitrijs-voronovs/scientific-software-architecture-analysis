Availability," 50-branch `if/elif` (in the bad cases) based on the name. `QubitCircuit` shouldn't need the million `_gate_resolved` functions - if there's a `Gate` class, instances of that (whether done by subclass or composition) should be supplying it (though the lookup table is a good choice under the circumstances). Given how `circuit.py` currently organises its data, it feels like you have to introduce some seemingly arbitrary splits to keep CodeClimate happy, but I'd argue the problem is the data structure, and CodeClimate is right to complain about the complexity. In stuff like compilers, there's a reason code compilers do parsing->verification->optimisation, with several passes in the last one, and transform things internally into a very strict intermediate representation at every step. `Qobj._repr_latex_` was like this - the `master` version is claimed to be like ""78"" complexity, but I'd be prepared to bet CodeClimate would have the `dev.major` version less than 10 and I think the output is near byte-for-byte identical. The change is that the `master` version basically reimplements the same algorithm 4 times with complex, split up for loops (not to mention that for some reason the alignment and new-line characters are considered part of formatting a number?). The `dev.major` version first decides if it's going to truncate the rows and/or columns, then it just calls a formatter on each row it decided it wants rendering with a special value to say when it should output a truncation character, and then joins the rows together. Obviously it's not _always_ the data structure - e.g. in `propagator` the branching to choose an evaluation method is fine, but once it's chosen, it should delegate to specialised methods. That way, the maintainer can verify the branching paths with a nice top-down overview without 50 lines of specialised logic inbetween each one, then you can verify each specialised path independently. If you did that, I'm sure the ""complexity"" would drop to like 10.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1447#issuecomment-782249555:3256,down,down,3256,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1447#issuecomment-782249555,1,['down'],['down']

Availability," `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---. About us breaking downstream CI: having been a maintainer of QuTiP and now Qiskit, I have a deep-rooted hatred for any upstream package that forces CI failures on its dependents, because it _requires_ the lower packages to move ""fix CI"" way up to the top of their priority list; you can't merge _anything_ until CI is running again, which is very frustrating. It messes with all your workflows.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075:1458,down,downstream,1458,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075,3,"['down', 'failure']","['downstream', 'failures']"
Availability," a while. Again, this certainly isn't an unsolvable problem: having versioning in the interface API is one solution to some of these problems. ---. For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining `__qutip_qobj__`, instead we expose an entry-point `qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None)`, and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. The logic inside the `Qobj` constructor remains approximately the same as what you suggest. I think TensorFlow does something a little more similar to this? (I'm not very familiar with it at all.). Advantages of this over a `__qutip_qobj__` magic method:; - Users aren't limited to what libraries define for them, but can add their own conversions or override library ones if they don't like them. I actually see this as being closer to Julia's dispatch, or Rust's `impl for`.; - It doesn't involve weird namespacing, or anything like that, and doesn't require downstream classes to carry around additional slots. It's less an issue for classes that define `__slots__` since those are frozen methods, but extra methods adds a minor amount vtable weight for most libraries, and makes their class definitions more complex.; - Control between different versions is perhaps a little easier (though a minor point): this _feels_ easier to separate out different versions, and detect what to register as the conversion function with QuTiP. This is a particular advantage for Python classes compiled as C-extensions (like from C or Cython), which typically don't allow assigning methods dynamically.; - A library could even register multiple versions of the conversion function with us, and let QuTiP handle API versioning centrally, rather than requiring downstream libraries to roll their own checks.; - We're basically already set up to do this in `dev.major` already.

Availability," current test of superoperator representations uses `choi_to_kraus` which also calls `scipy.linalg.eig`. Here is a file `kraus.py` that can reproduce these segfaults semi-reliably (may need to run it a few times to get it to trigger):. ```python; import qutip. s = qutip.rand_super(); c = qutip.to_choi(s); k = qutip.to_kraus(c); ```. For example, here's a similar command on this file:. ```; Debug memory block at address p=0x7f98cc467db0: API 'r'; 61503 bytes originally requested; The 7 pad bytes at p-7 are FORBIDDENBYTE, as expected.; The 8 pad bytes at tail=0x7f98cc476def are not all FORBIDDENBYTE (0xfd):; at tail+0: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+1: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+2: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+3: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+4: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+5: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+6: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+7: 0x00 *** OUCH; Data at p: dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00.

To see if I could track it down, I had a go with valgrind. This isn't guaranteed to find everything, because I'm not using a debug build of Python, and Python also typically optimises small allocations by using a custom allocator into some pre-allocated space it manages itself - invalid writes that still fall within this may not get detected by valgrind. Here is the output of `valgrind` running on the `kraus.py` file I wrote in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator).

Obviously I don't have the debugging symbols for MKL, so it's pretty hard to say where exactly it's coming from, but it is at least clearly inside that library. I ran `valgrind` on the `Malloc.py` file above, and get the exact same invalid write, which is promising. So the most likely public Python call is `scipy.linalg.eig`. ## Minimal reproducer. Ok, so now let me cut it down to a minimum `eig.py`:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scipy.linalg. x = np.random.rand(25, 25) + 1j*np.random.rand(25, 25); scipy.linalg.eig(x); ```. Note that this file does not even use `qutip`. You can run `PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler,tracemalloc eig.py`, and it will occasionally trigger a segfault (it happens to me about 1 in 5 times).

Availability," it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have. What I did instead is, I tried to make it clear in the documentation that the default value might be ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:1177,error,error,1177,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,1,['error'],['error']

Availability," the markdown source code per email like this, but I’m not sure if it works as I expected. The following is the markdown source code:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184#issuecomment-590737940:1161,error,error,1161,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184#issuecomment-590737940,1,['error'],['error']

I completely agree with your approach. I’m simply trying to push for this to be something that will come out in a reasonable timeframe and not be something forgotten. > We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment without using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features?. I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does not support the same qobj interface version. Everything else would work the same. You can still import and use the two libraries independently without issues. It’s indeed possible to design around this and supporting at the same time different versions of the interface, however, and there’s value in doing so. > To me, this is absolutely one of the mistakes that Numpy made in their implementation, and we shouldn't be copying it.

I'm now reasonably convinced that this isn't directly an issue with QuTiP. I suspect it isn't an issue with `scipy` either, but I'm not sure - it looks like a slight overwrite in MKL on macOS, though it's also possible that `scipy` passes some invalid pointers when dropping down to BLAS/LAPACK. I get the impression that the next steps involve dropping down a level of abstraction, down to Cython to directly call scipy's wrappers, or even fully down to C and link directly against MKL.

Availability,"**Summary of what was done:**. - Changes in floquet_master_equation_rates to make it faster.; - Corrected transposition errors in _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and changes to make it faster. I also removed a line so that the ME is solved in the interaction picture, this implies a different basis change in the _floquet_markov_mesolve_ function.; - Correction in _floquet_markov_mesolve_. As explained in the point above, the Floquet-Markov ME was not being solved in the interaction picture, therefore I modified _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and modified the basis change in _floquet_markov_mesolve_. This modification requires an additional variable in the entry of _floquet_markov_mesolve_ which can not be chosen by default. For the moment, if this variable is not given and _floquet_basis=False_, then the density matrix or expectation values are returned in the interaction picture, in the computational basis, and a warning message is sent. ; - Added integration options in: _floquet_modes, floquet_modes_t, floquet_modes_table, floquet_states_t, floquet_modes_t, floquet_wavefunction_t, fsesolve, floquet_master_equation_rates, fmmesolve_; - Added test functions to verify the dissipative dynamics:; a) Compare _fmmesolve_ and _mesolve_ for the cases: (NO drive but dissipation) and (Drive but NO dissipation); b) Compare numerical and analytical matrix elements for a driven-dissipative TLS with RWA. There are some places where the code could be modified to optimize the running time, especially in the basis change in _floquet_markov_mesolve_.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1248#issuecomment-740126949:120,error,errors,120,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1248#issuecomment-740126949,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"- I agree that renaming the _inner_point_color variable is a good idea. - The case you mention of black point_color with style 'l' also occurs in V4 and is solved by defining the variable as a list, e.g., ['black'] (which also works with the changes I proposed). So basically I assumed it was an expected use case. - I asked this question about style 's' plotting two colors in issue #1974, since we are given the same colors for style 's' and 'm', and Neil suggested leaving it as is. The docstring in the add_points function already tells you to give a single color for style 's' and a list of colors for style 'm'. - The error you get using style 'm' with two colors is that you need to specify a color for each point (you have to pass to the function a list of colors of the same length as the length of the points). In view of this, I don't know which approach you prefer to apply, as it depends on the expected use case. Given that the code works, perhaps the priority would be to specify the expected use while defining as part of issue #1913 the modifications you consider appropriate (although maybe someone will catch it earlier if you define it as a new issue).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2308#issuecomment-1916739672:624,error,error,624,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2308#issuecomment-1916739672,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"1. inside the ""Actions"" tab at the top of the GitHub page, you will only see workflows that are present in the code in the default git branch. `dev.major` isn't QuTiP's default branch, so the workflows won't appear immediately after this is merged, only when the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file also exists in `master`. 2. nothing prevents you from running the workflow on a fork, and there's no way and no reason to prevent this - it's also how I tested it. If you did run it on a fork, you'd be using your own GitHub Actions credits (it doesn't cost us anything because we're an open-source project). Only qutip/qutip knows the secret to publish to PyPI, so no fork can succeed on that. The branch check here serves two purposes: the first is that I needed some ""tickbox"" to let the admin decide at runtime whether they needed to publish the package or just build the wheels for personal download; the second is that we release off release branches, not master, so there needed to be an input to say _which_ branch should be built. 3. it's not 100% necessary, but it's the right thing to do. It decouples the project data from the setup code, which makes it much easier to modify both, and allows other tools to access the data. There are other PEPs in the works as well that will move all this data into `pyproject.toml`, rather than just `setup.cfg`. 4. oh, that's useful. I didn't really know or look into it, because it was only a temporary thing anyway. I might actually retire this PR and make it against `master` instead.

Availability,"2dd4680 and b6dcc28 fix the occasional segfaults I was getting, I believe. The error in `reshape_csr` was probably the randomly appearing one - I assume that for it to cause a segfault, either the output CSR needed to have been allocated on the edge of allocated memory (and then I probably would have seen it in the stack trace with `faulthandler`), or it needed to be called on a sufficiently small matrix that `mem.PyMem_Malloc` allocated into Python stack memory such that the next byte after `out.row_index` pointed into freed Python memory, causing a checksum error on the next `PyMem_Malloc` that hit it, or `PyMem_Free` on a previously created object. I was able to track down where these were coming from by judicious use of `gcc -fsanitize`, although had we been using Cython's `typedmemoryview`, setting `boundscheck=True` would also have caught it. Likewise, the error in `permute.dimensions_csr` would have been caught by setting `cdivision=False`, but I just didn't think to try that. It's probably not worth swapping to memory views just because of this, though - I was able to find it easily enough with `AddressSanitizer`, and memory views have a very non-trivial overhead on initialisation for our use case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332#issuecomment-668847474:79,error,error,79,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332#issuecomment-668847474,5,"['down', 'error', 'fault']","['down', 'error', 'faulthandler']"

Availability,"> However if `default_dtype` can be seen as _running in that mode_, it certainly could cause confusion. It's not clear how it is understood in some places. In `eigenstates`, if we run in `CSR` mode, then does that mean that we use the sparse eigen solver? It's a lot worst than the dense one. Or should only the returned ket be in CSR format?; > ; > In my tries, the dense steadystate was faster that the sparse one. Could it be an issue that some matrices where too big to fit in RAM forcing to use swap space? We could have a warning when matrices over a certain size are allocated. I guess this was mostly because I wasn't explicitly calling steadystate with sparse=False so it was getting converted back to CSR anyway, and slowing things down. Largely I see similar performance between CSR and dense (using sparse=False), unless I use very small systems (16x16 Liouvillians), though this seemed a bit scipy/method dependent. I guess as you said this also raises the question about whether stuff like eigenstates and steadystate() should default to using methods based on the data layer of the object, instead of kwargs? My feeling is not, since eigenstates+sparse can be bad and steadystate+largesystem+dense could be bad, so its worth having some default conversion cost in place. But I still like the idea of what gets returned to the user following default_dtype. but maybe we can see if this turns out to be an issue that people have in using data layers, could just be me!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2328#issuecomment-1953388192:742,down,down,742,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2328#issuecomment-1953388192,1,['down'],['down']

In particular, how should the change in e_ops signature be handled (for the HEOM solver the e_ops callables also take the full ADO state). I ended up always calling `e_ops` functions with `f(t, ado_state)`. This is a bit different to other solvers, but makes what the HEOMSolver considers the evolution state consistent. The density matrix part of the state is available as `ado_state.rho` so it's not a big hardship to retrieve just the system state. >> 3.

Kind of lucky that it didn't fail before. We either have to change the test to use a larger tolerance in the comparison, or give an argument to `Qobj permute` to not use `tidyup`. This is not really related to this PR but I'll implement the change once we decide on the best solution. Does anyone have thoughts on why `Qobj permute` uses `tidyup` by default in the first place?

Availability,"> Knowing the tensor structure is still necessary for enforcing the Hilbert spaces are of the correct dimensions, even if the resulting state can't be written as a product of states on individual spaces. I think there's a lot more design to do to work out a sensible data structure which can really take advantage of this lazy representation, but my morning-after reaction to this is that it's very non-trivial without a lot of code duplication.; > ; > It's easy enough to imagine how it will work for operators of structure `[scalar, oper, scalar] * [scalar, scalar, oper] -> [scalar, oper, oper]` - in this case the final result is fully expanded in the last two states, and not in the first. It's much trickier dealing with `[oper, scalar, scalar] * [scalar, oper, oper] -> [oper, scalar, oper]`. In this case, since there's a subspace in between them, you need a specifically ""lazy"" Kronecker product.

Availability,"> Overall, it look good as a way to make HEOM solvers work on v5. Woot. > But the use of data layer seems not ideal, why is the rhs fixed to `csr`. With it's size, it's probably not ideal as a Dense, but I don't think we should raise an error for other type... It doesn't actually restrict the RHS to CSR -- it only *constructs* the RHS as a CSR initially. The base solver will convert the RHS to the correct format for the integrator if needed. It might be possible one day to avoid constructing the RHS as a CSR but it might be tricky to make it not horribly slow, so I'd like to leave this as potential enhancement rather than work on it right now. > There is no `heomsolve` to go with `HEOMSolver`. I've added `heomsolve`. It has more parameters than `sesolve` or `mesolve`, which is not great, but I'm not sure how to avoid it. The bath and the max_depth are not really optional for the HEOM, and there aren't reasonably default values. > With other solvers, they accept `H` as a `Qobj` or `QobjEvo` only, list format is accepted by the __solve function. I changed HEOMSolver to only support `Qobj` or `QobjEvo`. I allowed `HSolverDL` to continue to support other objects since `HSolverDL` exists only for backwards compatibility.

Availability,"> `result.measurement` is not the same as `result.expect`, the measurement is an expectation value, but not of the `e_ops` but `m_ops` which are usually automatically generated from the `c_ops` and noise is added to the computed expectation value of the state of the trajectory. The noise is usually larger than the signal and makes it hard to see, but it should converge to mesolve's solution eventually.; > ; > `smesolve`'s `expect` are just the expectation value of the state of each trajectories (averaged or not depending on options) and should average to the master equation solutions with enough trajectories. Plot in cell 8 show the match is quite good. Even with enough trajectories, the numerical error from `smesolve` will be visible.; > ; > The equation solved are those written in the notebook.

Thank you very much for your reply, but I still don't quite understand `smesolve`'s `expect` are just the expectation value of the state of each trajectories”. In my understanding, solving for 'smesolve' gives the corresponding 'ρ(t)' and then 'expect'. But 'smesolve' provides **[ntraj [int] number of trajectors]**, which means that there are _ntraj_ 'ρ(t)' (`expect`). If I want to show all _ntraj_ ‘s 'expect', how can I do it?. Can I understand `result.measurement` as measuring(POVM) the `smesolve.result` (where ρ(t) was given by solving the stochastic master equation) .$\hat{\rho}_{f}=\frac{\hat{\Omega}_{m}\hat{\rho}\hat{\Omega}_{m}^{\dagger}}{\mathrm{Tr}[\hat{\Omega}_{m}\hat{\rho}\hat{\Omega}_{m}^{\dagger}]}$。If this is the case, I don't understand the point of doing the measurement again here, because the stochastic master equation itself has a continuous measurement. What I want to do is simply solve the stochastic master equation to get enough trajectories **ρ(t)** and solve the relevant expected value **Tr[ρ(t)A]**.

Availability,"@Ericgig and I had a brief discussion about how to handle `inf` and `nan` generally. One option is forbid them entirely from the data layer -- i.e. to check and raise an error whenever a new data layer is created. A potential downside to this is we'd have to check often to be sure, since any operation can potentially create `nan` and `inf`, even simple addition:; ```python; >>> 1e308 + 1e308; inf; >>> (1e308 + 1e308) - (1e308 + 1e308); nan; ```; an alternative is to try propagate `nan` and `inf` only as correctly as, e.g., `BLAS`. What happens with `BLAS` is that `nan` and `inf` propagate reasonably correctly, but are considered fairly interchangeable -- i.e. `nan`, `inf`, and `-inf` are all just bad values.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1957#issuecomment-1208234717:170,error,error,170,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1957#issuecomment-1208234717,2,"['down', 'error']","['downside', 'error']"

Availability,"@hodgestar shall we attempt to sort out the caching now, or get things moved over ahead of Unitary Hack and sort it out later? I don't think it's particularly a blocking issue - the tests still all run fine, after all. There's an argument against using `pip wheel` caching for us - we've historically used our tests to try and catch errors when using new versions of packages, which we'd lose if we start pinning versions to one particular thing. I'm not sure which is more desirable for us - overall I think the time loss from installing `cvxpy` isn't _that_ high, and we'd get more improvement from redoing some of our older tests.

Availability,"@jakelishman, about the two issues you raised:. 1. Import time related to `import qutip`; I agree with you that in order to make it frictionless for downstream libraries to implement qutip's interface you'd want not to increase their loading times. That would easily be achieved by defining the `__qutip_qobj__` as the entry point of this API. A drawback of this implementation is that it requires the conversion method to be defined on the object itself.; The dispatch-like solution, as was proposed by @hodgestar, is easier to play with, can be defined in a separate file, can be added to a separate package like `netket_qutip_interop` or even using setuptools entry points, though that would add complexity. Again, I'm personally not biased. I would go with option 1 because it's simpler, but I do like the organisational beauty of option 2 (that is used throughout the jax ecosystem). 2. About implicit conversion; - Assume we can distinguish two level of APIs exposed by qutip, similar in spirit to the distinction there is between BLAS and LAPACK. ; - There are low level (BLAS-like) operations on Qobjs such as addition, kron, sum, ecc that are performed repeatedly, can be efficiently implemented only among objects whose data structure is well know. Everything is built on top of those, so they need to be fast with a low overhead. ; - There are higher-level (LAPACK-like) operations on Qobjs, such as `.eigenvalues()` or `eigenstates()`, or `sesolve/mesolve` which are built by combining several low level operations. Their runtime is much higher, and they perform a fair bit of setup/input handling, which comes at the price of some overhead, but which is negligible compared to the runtime cost for most meaningfully large systems. I'd then like to state that; - *I have never suggested to insert a mechanism to insert implicit conversion in the low-level operations.* ; - In this RFC in no way have I proposed to implement implicit conversion anywhere else then were is already done in qu",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687:149,down,downstream,149,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"About the simulation, the frequency of your `H0` is at the level of 10^12 (with w0=0), while your control amplitude `Delta` is only 10^6! This is a huge difference. I feel like there might be an error in the unit somewhere. The number of time steps sampled needs to be hundreds of millions. Simulate this whole process is not practical. By setting `w-w0=0` you discard the fast process and what remains is only `Delta`. With `w-w0=0`, I get reasonable oscillation with the following code; ```python; def pulse(t0,t):; return np.heaviside(t-t0,2e-9). def H1_coeff(t,args):; t0=args['t0']; phi=args['phi']; return Delta*pulse(t0,t)*np.sin((w-w0)*t+phi). H = [H0,[sx,H1_coeff]]. times=np.linspace(0, 0.00001, 1000). args = {""t0"":0, ""phi"":np.pi/2}; result = mesolve(H, basis(2,0), times, args=args, e_ops=[sz]); plt.plot(result.expect[0]); plt.show(); ```. If you want to observe the effect of RWA, you could set `w-w0` to be about 10 times `Delta`. That is, the frequency of your system's dynamics is about ten times larger than your driving. Discarding the system dynamics by RWA will lead to some visible error in the plot, but not significantly enough to destroy the driving dynamics. (Edited) About pulse that spikes up and dies down, a spike at one single time point is not well defined. Mathematically the integral will be 0 (in measures that makes sense here at least). If you want a pulse that is turned on for a certain duration and then off, you can use two Heaviside. But much easier: you can just shift your time scale and define your tlist `times` to be that time duration from `0` to `t_end`, which matches the duration of your pulse.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810331229:195,error,error,195,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810331229,3,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

Availability,"Ah, nice catch thanks, and thanks for the super clear repro. We're overhauling the solvers for QuTiP 5.0, which will include a lot more rigorous input checking on entry, but also it uses far safer low-level datatypes that would catch this shape mismatch in the C layer (even though the `dims` _should_ have been checked by `mesolve`). I'll check the other solvers and patch in a sanity test - probably after these lines: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d5e305513d9186df74beee4fd8da680e89f29d15/qutip/mesolve.py#L259-L261; we can just insert a test; ```python; if rho0.dims[0] != rho0.dims[1]:; raise ValueError(; ""input state must be a pure state or square density matrix""; ); ```. There may also be other segfaults lurking if you use a Python function to generate a time-dependent `Qobj` value in the Liouvillian or the expectation operators, but right now you're unlikely to use that form (because it's slow as anything). The bug slips through because we unsafely pass off a matrix down to C code (where we currently don't have sanity checks) without first verifying that it is a valid shape in Python space - the C code is working as designed, so there shouldn't be problems with correct inputs. Removing `c_ops` causes `mesolve` to delegate to `sesolve` which presumably is better at its type-checking, and I expect that a small dimension size working is likely just `malloc` having slack in the memory it gives us for small sizes or small requests being allocated into the special pre-allocated store.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169:988,down,down,988,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169,1,['down'],['down']

Obviously, this falls into the ""quite a bit of work"" category, assuming it's possible at all. Personally, I also want to clarify that in #853, I wasn't thinking clearly when I titled it ""moderately big tensor products"" (obviously, it was an insanely large product). I don't actually foresee needing anything bigger than int32. Is there a CPU-time penalty for switching to int64?

Availability,"As I understand it, the only way to avoid needing to touch `MANIFEST.in` is to not have files distributed with the test suite (or to have the temporary files by `*.py`, since `setup.py` automatically recognises them). That's not really a pytest thing, it's a `setuptools` one. I don't think there's a problem distributing files as part of the tests. You can add a line which says; ```; recursive-include qutip/tests/qasm_files *.qasm; ```; to `MANIFEST.in`, and that should hopefully fix the problem. You won't have the problem locally, because you'll be running `./setup.py develop`, which ""installs"" in-place, so you don't notice the fact that you've missed files from the manifest. In the tests, it runs `./setup.py install`, which does the copy, missing files which aren't in the manifest. Boxi: I'm not certain what more you'd like to do with fixtures here. Fixtures are good for setup and tear down, parametrisation and sharing resources (like network connections), but I'm not certain what further benefit you get for a test function which is testing whether it can open a known file, read it, and construct the expected output. I think Sidhant is already doing some nice parametrisation of his tests, from what I see. Sidhant: I added a comment on the exception test, since pytest gives us an easier-to-read context manager you can use. It's also typically better practice to handle file paths like I did in that (using the overloaded `/` operator with `pathlib.Path`, or `os.path.join`) rather than manually putting in slashes. Windows _usually_ will do the right thing now with slashes, but it's better to let Python handle it for us.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156:900,down,down,900,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"As a note: `qutip.vector_to_operator` is part of the implementation of superoperators. The ""vector"" in the name refers to the idea that a superoperator in a Hilbert space can be represented as a vector on a different Hilbert space which comprises of two copies of the original space tensor-producted together. It doesn't refer to a ""vector"" in the sense of a ""ket"". The difference was introduced in c62a8e9, which is the amalgamated commit encompassing all the discussion in #1098. `qutip.vector_to_operator` expects to receive an argument whose `dims` parameter is of the form `[operator_dims , [1]]`, where `operator_dims` is the dimensions of a regular operator (for example `[[2], [2]]` for a single qubit Hilbert space, or `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` for an operator acting on a Hilbert space with two qubits in. The exception occurs because `vector_to_operator` attempts to access the two elements of the `operator_dims` array to discover the output shape. Since there is an insufficient number of lists for it to access, it just ends up reading the dimensions of the first two elements of the tensor product, and `np.prod` (used to calculate the output shape) doesn't complain when passed scalars. Notice that running the code with `nb_qubits = 1` will cause an `IndexError`, as there are insufficient tensor-product elements. The immediate solution for your code is to use `qutip.ket2dm`, which converts a ket into a density matrix. I think this is what you're actually trying to do. For a fix, there are two points:; 1. The fix is simply to test that the input dimensions are of the correct form, rather than assuming; this will allow us to provide a more descriptive error.; 2. Perhaps worth considering is moving the super-operator functionality in a sub-module `qutip.super`, and not importing all the functions into the main namespace. This might help reduce user confusion going forwards, especially since most people aren't using the superoperator formalism.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1204#issuecomment-600792011:1668,error,error,1668,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1204#issuecomment-600792011,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Assuming Simon's point isn't just a complete answer to your question: in the general case, this is an impossible question to answer - it touches on many parts of numerical integration, such as tolerance limits and adaptive step-size methods. When you're dealing with completely arbitrary time-dependence, there's not really any one-size-fits-all approach that'll work (despite how RK45 is often taught as a magic bullet in physics courses). Here, you will likely find that your RK45 results depend strongly on how many intermediate timesteps you use, whereas QuTiP's results will be (marginally) more stable. This is because QuTiP will internally subdivide the timesteps more to achieve internal precision goals, but then only returns the results at the time points you ask for. You can increase the maximum number of allowed subdivisions by increasing the `nsteps` parameter in a `qutip.Options` object, and with the `options` keyword argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136:193,toler,tolerance,193,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136,1,['toler'],['tolerance']
Availability,"Assuming you have Anaconda 2.5 installed (so that you can use the Intel MKL on all platforms), the default number of threads is one. Therefore, you don't get much benefit. To change the number of threads used you can do:. ``` python; import mkl; mkl.set_num_threads(N); ```. or in QuTiP it is easy to set using:. ``` python; n_threads = hardware_info()['cpus']; mkl.set_num_threads(n_threads); ```. One can not access the spare MKL routines directly as there is no support in the scipy.sparse library. However, you can get to all of the functions using ctypes. An example of complex SpMV is here:. https://gist.github.com/nonhermitian/74c3ddbbd006b2f8d306. The only issue with the attached method, is that finding the MKL runtime library is platform dependent (maybe should file an issue with the Anaconda people?). Therefore, it is a bit cumbersome to work with. Moreover, it is not possible to access these routines via Cython as they do not have any of the development stuff available. That may not really be an issue at the end of the day though as one needs quite a large system to get any benefit, and at large Hilbert dimensions, the overhead from calling Python funcs. directly is not an issue. I will be chatting with the [Intel Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/python-distribution) people tomorrow to give them some suggestions and talk about our project.

Availability,"Bumping an old topic with two major new considerations. Number one: Travis is [changing its pricing model for open source software](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing), and generally it seems like [it's going to become unfeasible for us](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works). Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in. In around March 2021 we expect the old travis-ci.org that QuTiP is grandfathered onto to shut down completely, forcing us onto the new model on travis-ci.com. Number two: in November 2019, GitHub released their own CI, GitHub Actions. This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers. This completely free period of GitHub Actions might not last forever (you can imagine maybe they're just trying to drive adoption before increasing the cost), but especially with the new time pressure from Travis, this seems like the right choice for now. Our testing set up is fairly straightforward, so migrating to a new CI shouldn't be too difficult. I just wrote (#1429) a GitHub Actions workflow to build and distribute binary releases of QuTiP on Linux/Mac/Windows, and I'm pretty convinced by the power of their CI. It's got an awful lot of flexibility with a _lot_ of customisation so its initial learning curve is a little steep (or maybe I'm just not used to CI tools), but I'm impressed by what's available. I believe it comes with a degree of reusability as well; I think we can define a test as a single ""action"", and then reuse that in the PR-push workflow and the make-distribution workflow.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542:753,down,down,753,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542,2,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'down']"
Availability,"Bumping this because I'm working on `test_metrics.py` and came across it. ## Attempting to isolate. With `cvxpy` and `cvxopt` from conda-forge, I can run all the `dnorm` tests, but as before (see #874, #880, #881) they fail too much of the time. By my rough tests, failure only occurs with any regularity when using `cvxpy` with operator inputs (not supers) of dimension 3 (not 2). I also find that using `dnorm(A, B)` with `A` and `B` drawn from `rand_unitary_haar` has a failure rate of 0.004(1), whereas drawing from `rand_unitary` instead has a failure rate about 3 times higher of 0.012(2). I'm sure if you have more (i.e. > 0) knowledge of the Haar measure than I do, that presumably gives you more information on what makes it likely for the optimisation to fail. Also, using `dnorm(A)` (i.e. taking `B` to be 0) produced no failures in 4000 tests of the same function. ## Testing strategy. Since each `dnorm` test is repeated 10 times and there's only one offending test, that's a current failure rate of about 4%. The offending test actually isn't even testing what it's supposed to test - it supposedly tests that special cases that are handled by QuTiP agree with the optimisations done by `cvxpy`, except that the offender isn't a handled special case. I'll remove that for now. I will also convert `dnorm` tests to quietly xfail if the optimisation fails, but cause a suite failure if they cause a proper `AssertionError`. ## Future. Since we have a new major version in the future, we do have the option to issue a `FutureWarning` and remove `dnorm` if we want to do so, but if so, we should get the warning out as soon as possible. It's probably worth mentioning that by-and-large, it seems like `dnorm` does actually work in most cases. > This has been the final straw. We have tried to keep dnorm supported. - @ajgpitch .

Of course we can not avoid all conflicts, but since loading scipy is so fundamental to what we do, having no conflicts with this package seems to be reasonable, at least to me. .

Availability,"Consider what you're doing from a statistical sense here. If everything works correctly, then you're effectively trying a two-tail hypothesis test that your test binomial distribution has a probability of 0.25, given you made `n` observations of it. The analytic success rate of your test is then; ```python; import scipy.stats; def success(n, p, tol):; dist = scipy.stats.binom(n, p); return dist.cdf(n * (p+tol)) - dist.cdf(n * (p-tol)); ```; where `success(4096, 0.25, 0.02)` is 99.67%. Since there are 5 independent runs on Travis, that's equivalent to a failure rate of 1.6% on every single CI run, which is several orders of magnitude too high. It's probably just luck that it was Python 3.8 on both occasions - it's a one-in-five chance that in two failing CI runs, it was the same setup both times. You have to consider what is most appropriate to fix the test, and what you can reasonably test in ~1 second of runtime. You don't want to increase the tolerance too much, because then you can get a lot of false positives even if something is broken. If you can bump the number of runs up to 100,000 and set the tolerance at 0.01, you'll have a per-test failure rate of ~3e-13, which is more like what we'd want.

Availability,"First of all I'm glad you could get it to run under OSX. Which OpenCL environment are you using?; - Is the failure of `test_mcsolve_cl_time_dep_h` reproducible?; - You can probably ignore the compiler warning. I assume it is related to the pragma statement. Some OpenCL implementations refuse to work without it, others give you a warning that it is unnecessary. Maybe we can omit the statement based on the platform version and hide some warning, but that would require more testing (on different platforms). At the moment there is a lot of debug information to ease testing.; - The AttributeError you get is something I have not encountered yet. If you do consider merging this branch, it is a good idea to get more people involved in testing. The code has not been reviewed and probably contains some bugs. The questions you raised concerning the maintainability are all valid. On top of that setting up OpenCL is somewhat troublesome, which makes `mcsolve_cl` a kind of experimental feature. Ultimately it is up to the maintainers of qutip to decide whether such a feature should be included. The advantage `mcsolve_cl` has over `mcsolve_f90` is that it supports some time-dependence and introduces no build dependencies. If, for some reason `mcsolve_cl` does not work, the user can always fall back to `mcsolve`.

Availability,"For a constant Liouvillian, it seems very reasonable that an eigenseries-based solution would be faster? In the end, that massively reduces the number of matrix-matrix operations to be done. I'm not at all familiar with Matlab, but I wouldn't be shocked if that's what your toolbox there is doing too. Looking at your code, you seem to have 16 cores available. QuTiP at present can't make too much use of multiple cores in `mesolve` or `essolve` (though it can in `correlation`), whereas Matlab may well have some fancy parallelised methods for solving eigenvector problems (if doing that method) - we rely on Scipy for our eigenvector calculations, and I'm pretty sure there's no parallelisation in there. There could also be large timing disparities if you're not being linked to good BLAS/LAPACK/ARPACK implementations in Python space. I'm sure that any distributed version of Matlab will come stuffed with lovely libraries compiled specifically for your processor's instruction set, but Scipy may only be able to find Netlib BLAS or (even worse) Accelerate - if so, they probably won't be making good use of vectorised instructions in your processor, and may not be well-optimised for memory access.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1591#issuecomment-871031472:350,avail,available,350,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1591#issuecomment-871031472,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"For clarity: I ran your code with 1,000 timesteps and 10,000 timesteps and found a linalg norm difference in the outputs of 4.4e-4 (compared to QuTiP's 6.5e-8), which is what I meant. I considered that difference ""not fully convergent"" in part because QuTiP's default tolerance goals have an absolute tolerance of ~1e-8 (that's per-element, not the full norm). Here's a couple more things to look at:; - if you're using QuTiP objects without our solvers like this, we tidy up sparse matrices at every operation. You probably don't want that - you might get different results if you convert your RK method to work on raw Numpy arrays.; - your RHS isn't accurate - it takes `sqrt(gamma)`, but your time-dependent function already does that. This is perhaps a mistake, and very likely the source of the discrepancy? Also, while it's irrelevant here, your Lindbladian has `c_op * c_op.dag() * rho` as the last term, but it should be `c_op.dag() * c_op * rho`.; - your RK method isn't using updated versions of the Hamiltonian or the collapse operator at the intermediate timesteps.; - you say you're using RK45, but you've only got 4 different evaluations?

Availability,"For large matrices (`dim > ~500`), the dense matrix dot product is still a pretty large cost, but you're still saving a fair amount. That said, at that kind of dimension, the analytical formula may do you well enough. If you want derivatives wrt alpha, you should be able to get analytic ones from my method - there's no ""black box"" numerical work that goes on in `__call__`, everything is just matrix multiplication. Given that it appears non-linearly in a possibly large multiplication, though, and I would imagine the derivatives are pretty smooth, you may well just be faster just numerically approximating it with finite differences (I don't know anything about autodifferentiation). If you're so inclined, you can sacrifice some speed for higher accuracy in the eigenvector calculations, as we can find the eigenvalues semi-analytically. There are a few places in numpy and scipy that can find the roots of the Hermite polynomials for you (i.e. get the eigenvalues), which will be found exactly wrt double precision (I believe). You can then call out to the LAPACK routine `dstein` to get the eigenvectors from the eigenvalues. `dstein` is slower than `dstemr`/`dsteqr` (which is what scipy uses, I think), but it allows us to supply the eigenvalues, removing some numerical error.

Availability,"For point 2: adding marks right now will cause conflicts, but if #1181 gets merged then it'll be much simpler. The main issue is that a lot of the testing structure has changed for tests up to `test_mcsolve.py` alphabetically, and so in general the tests are just not the same. The principle is pretty straightforwards - just like #1181 introduces a `requires_cython` mark, we would add `uses_cython`, `uses_mkl` and `uses_openmp` marks. These would be even simpler to add than `requires_cython` because unlike it, they don't require any test-generation logic at all. The change would simply be to add them to `pytest.ini`, mark the requisite functions and then change the pytest invocation of the specialised test to `pytest -m ""uses_cython""` or whatever. As far as I'm aware, the only parts of their codebase which modify their behaviour based on whether `Cython` is available is `QobjEvo`. The other parts (like `brmesolve`) just don't work if Cython isn't there. The MKL tests would become very short; by my reckoning, MKL is only used by `steadystate` and `countstat`. OpenMP is much more pervasive, as `sesolve`, `mesolve` and `brmesolve` all use it, and parts which depend on those are generally the slowest tests. The short tests could just become `pytest -m ""not slow""`? That's not super speedy, but it takes about half the time, maybe. If you want more, then a good starting point is `pytest --durations=0` which will tell us which tests are the slowest (perhaps that was what you already did when marking the slow ones?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776:869,avail,available,869,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Good catch, this seems to be a problem with how the arguments are structured in the function signature for brme_solve. For the tensor formation, . `def bloch_redfield_tensor(H, a_ops, spectra_cb=None, c_ops=[], use_secular=True, sec_cutoff=0.1):`. In this case, the spectra_cb is given the [ohmic_spectrum] argument, which is the correct argument. However, for the brme_solve, the signature is . ```; def brmesolve(H, psi0, tlist, a_ops=[], e_ops=[], c_ops=[],. args={}, use_secular=True, sec_cutoff = 0.1,; tol=qset.atol,; spectra_cb=None, options=None,; progress_bar=None, _safe_mode=True, verbose=False):; ```. If you run the same code with . `output = brmesolve(H, psi0, tlist, [sigmax()], e_ops, spectra_cb = [ohmic_spectrum]); `. the code will run perfectly. However, this is an issue we should fix since spectra_cb is a depreciated argument and technically the c_ops list should accommodate arbitrary noise power spectrum functions that spectra_cb handled before. The error seems to be originating because ohmic_spectrum is of type function but the safety checker expects either a Qobj or a tuple.

There always was a work-around; allowing `np.array(qobj)` was more to save him from writing `x = x.full() if isinstance(x, Qobj) else np.asarray(x)`. That said, I came round to the idea more as I read more about the control we can have over the rest of the numpy infrastructure. We can allow `np.array` on `Qobj` (satisfying Michael's original request), and with a little bit of extra code we can prevent all the super weird ufunc/implicit casting behaviour, because `Qobj` shouldn't be able to implicitly interoperate with raw arrays. I know in my personal code I'd rather use `Qobj.full()`, but I no longer think it's _wrong_ to allow `np.array(qobj)` given that other people like it, even with these numpy 1.20 problems.

Availability,"Hello Eric, thank you for the quick response!. We have spoken with some members of the qutip team during the grant meetings regarding porting it directly into qutip, and we agreed it would be a good addition as a separate solver. There are a couple of we-believe-good reasons to provide <code>krylovsolve</code> as another qutip solver. As you mention, the method is currently limited to constant closed system Hamiltonians. Another possible addition discussed during the meetings was support for open quantum systems, which provides another unitary-fund grant opportunity for some students!. Another important application for many-body systems comes in handy with Krylov. Given the memory limitations from matrix representation of operators and the exponential growth of many-body systems Hilbert spaces, the limit of qubits on which the solvers live is around 15 qubits. This limitation gets expanded (in exchange for some slow down in the computations) to a few more qubits exploiting the binary operational nature of many-body systems. While any solver could use operations instead of matrices, it is a good testing bead to use Krylov's algorithm because of a property when constructing this space. This feature is a must-have within our research group, and everyone could also benefit from it. More importantly, Krylov is gaining increasing interest in the research community, and we believe that providing it as a qutip solver will increase the traffic of the repository. Regarding benchmarks and some documentation, we have a public jupyter notebook with some benchmarks here [krylov use examples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7ng8q9QNEzaZ97vGop3aIip8GPtl3GR?usp=sharing), and there's also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@julian.ruffinelli/krylov-approximation-method-for-quantum-evolution-148b3f023ec4) with some other details.

Availability,"Hi @VolodyaCO, thanks for reporting this!; I think the reason for `tlist` being overridden is because the result will be independent of `tlist` when the input is a steady-state. This can be seen in the following equations:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57414022/121327018-5d313680-c913-11eb-9760-ca6004daca18.png); where rho is the initial state (`state0`) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. I use the fact that rho is a steady-state to remove its temporal dependence. This derivation is simplified assuming unitary evolution (no collapse operators) but the same applies in the most general case where we include the collapse operators. This is my guess on why `tlist=[0]` is employed when using `state0=None`: the result does not depend on `tlist`. Hence, this is probably not a bug as the result should be mathematically correct. That being said, I would also expect the same output shape for the cases shown above unless explicitly mentioned in the docstring of the function. Thus, I think the way to go here is to document this behaviour in the docstring (as well as removing the t appearing in correlation_..._1t docstring) as any change in the output shape will break backwards compatibility. However, it may be worth considering whether this is the intended behaviour for QuTiP 5. I would suggest removing `state0=None` as possible input for simplicity in the maintenance and testing or at least I would make the example shown by @VolodyaCO to be consistent and have the same output.

Availability,"Hi @nathanshammah,. Could this issue perhaps be broken into sub-tasks in some way, perhaps, in order to enable work starting on it a bit more feasible?. Also, I can see it's been labelled as a ""good first issue"" but it seems to me the definition of done (i.e., what would a PR - or a set of PRs - that would successfully address the problem entail?), with respect to the entire issue, could be clarified a bit further, and the breakdown into sub-tasks (which itself might result organically from some further discussion) might help a bit in that direction. Regarding possible approaches for handling randomness - I have to admit I've started looking into QuTiP only very recently, and I'm yet to start familiarising myself with its more intricate details and get to run the full set of tests, and investigate what kind of test failures occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:827,failure,failures,827,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,1,['failure'],['failures']
Availability,"Hi @nonhermitian, I spent some time struggling with this as I recently shifted to macOS. This problem affects other Python installations too. I found a solution to this and if you could update it in the docs instead of the default macOS installation script, then it would be very helpful for new users. I will post the solution first and explain it below. . 1. Install a manual Python version which overrides the default Python supplied by Apple in the `usr/bin/python` path. You can check this using ```which python```. Installing using brew - . ```brew install python```. 2. Change the default Python interpreter from the one supplied by macOS in `usr/bin/python` to the user installed version in `/usr/local/bin/python`. This is explained in this [post](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/09/27/use-python-effectively-on-os-x#p1). Edit the file `/etc/paths` using ```sudo vi etc/paths``` and move the line `/usr/local/bin` to the top. This makes the user installed Python default and the packages installed by pip or brew are imported instead of the ones supplied by apple. Restart the terminal. You may need to update numpy and scipy using ```pip install numpy``` or ```pip install numpy -U```. 3. Install qutip using ```python setup.py install```. Apple has its own Python version and a few modules such as numpy and scipy come along with it which are at `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7`. These modules are difficult to manage and update due to issues with permission. Hence, even if you update numpy or scipy using `pip` or `brew`, it is not detected by Python. ~~This also raises an issue later `error: could not create 'build/src.macosx-10.12-x86_64-2.7': Permission denied`~~. This solution seems better since it does not mess with the system default. Edit 1 : sudo -H is needed to install using ```sudo -H python setup.py install```.

Availability,"Hi @pschindler, thanks for reporting this! Although the eigenenstates are different for both cases (`sparse=True` and `sparse=False`) I believe that they are both equally valid since the operator has degenerated eigenvalues. The approach for the computation of the eigenstates for both `sparse=True ` and `sparse=False` is different so that may explain why you see different results. For the case that @Ericgig presented though, the eigenvalues are non-degenerated. I tracked down the issue and it is related to how we compute these eigenvalues. When we ask for all the eigenvalues what we actually do is to compute the smallest half in with one method (`scipy.sparse.linalg(which='LR')`) and the largest half with a different method (`scipy.sparse.linalg(which='SR')`). Smallest half and largest half here means relative to the _real_ part of the eigenvalue. This makes complete sense for the cases where the eigenvalues are real but unfortunately not so much sense when we only care about the imaginary part. This is what the `which` is doing, is selecting the values with smallest/largest real part. If we include a small real component the bug completely disappears:; ```; In [56]: (qutip.num(4)*(1j+0.00001)).eigenenergies(sparse=True); Out[56]:; array([1.23048985e-16-2.21177095e-16j, 1.00000000e-05+1.00000000e+00j,; 2.00000000e-05+2.00000000e+00j, 3.00000000e-05+3.00000000e+00j]); ```; Because now there is a real part to use in the ordering. The behavior of `eigenstates` is definitely wrong and one way of solving it would be to not use both `LR` and `SR` options when all the eigenvalues are required and instead chose internally just one. This would still return results ordered by their real part but at least all the eigenvalues would be present (only once). We may want to extend the behavior of `eigenstates` to not only accept `sort=low` and `sort=high` and instead have a similar behavior to the one provided by scipy and allow sorting by imaginary part or absolute value.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1416862009:476,down,down,476,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1416862009,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Hi @pschindler,. Indeed, the behavior you show is a bug in qutip 4.7.0. Thanks for reporting this! However, it is actually a bug in the `sparse=True` case. The scipy case gives a different result compared to qutip sparse because of the method used. `eigh` assumes the input is hermitian but `op` is not. You can see the correct eigenvalues using:; ```; In [7]: scipy.linalg.eigvals(op.full()); Out[7]:; array([-1. -2.22044605e-16j, -0.5+8.66025404e-01j, -0.5-8.66025404e-01j,; 0.5+8.66025404e-01j, 0.5-8.66025404e-01j, 1. +0.00000000e+00j]); ```. I am genuinely surprised that the `sparse=False` is bugged in the latest version of qutip. Fortunately, I tested this in the master branch of qutip (this contains the qutip 5.0.0 alpha version) and the bug seems to be solved there. This operator is indeed subjected to the same bug Eric shows (it is non-hermitian). However, due to the real part of the eigenvalues, it actually shows the correct answer (similar to the example I showed in my previous comment). I will try to find the source of the error but it seems very likely that we incorrectly label the operator as hermitian and hence uses the wrong method to find eigenvalues.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348:1045,error,error,1045,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348,1,['error'],['error']

I'm not that familiar with matplotlib on Windows, but I'm guessing that; something has gone wrong with the event loop being used to render the; matplotlib figures (possibly QuTiP did something wrong or maybe something; else happened).

Availability,"Hi Louis,. There is work in development that will allow `QobjEvo` to be build from callback also, not just list. This will make callback work anywhere easily. . I was in the impression that H callback worked already for mcsolve. I rewrote part of mcsolve and broke it. Looking at your commit, I inverted `_funcrhs_with_state` and `_funcrhs`...; Sorry to have you take time to correct it. The 20x is big, but the list format allows for optimizations that are hard to do with a callback. A big one is that you don't need to create a new matrix/Qobj when calling `mul_vec`, just use it. With this code, I see a 20x between `mul_vec` and creating a Qobj a python function. . ```; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. qoe = qt.QobjEvo([qt.qeye(3),[qt.destroy(3), lambda t,_:np.sin(t)]]); qoe.compile(). o1 = qt.qeye(3); o2 = qt.destroy(3) ; def H(t):; return o1 + o2 * np.sin(t). v = np.ones(3)+0j; %timeit qoe(0); %timeit qoe.mul_vec(0, v); %timeit H(0); %timeit H(0).data * v; ```. One optimization you could do is having the callback return a `np.array` instead of a Qobj. In `mcsolve`, this would probably be simple to implement and I expect some speed gain. But it can't really be officially supported in Qutip, for now. . ps. All those 'redundant' argument setting are for reusing the system (`ss`) in multiple call of `mcsolve` with different args, used in `correlation`. Using string coefficient, the compilation step can take a few second, so it is set to be able to reuse a compiled system, changing the `psi0`, `args`, `e_ops`, etc. This will become a less obscure feature in v5 when solver object are available.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634:1241,redundant,redundant,1241,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634,2,"['avail', 'redundant']","['available', 'redundant']"

I can also send you the markdown source code per email like this, but I’m not sure if it works as I expected. The following is the markdown source code:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq.

See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system.

Availability,"Hi Subimal,. This happens because of the truncation of the Fock space. You can see a related discussion here ; https://groups.google.com/g/qutip/c/DD6z8kYUU1I/m/k48XZS1AAgAJ. But in short, with truncation there is always an error in the commutators, so for truncating the Fock states at N photons, I think you find that [a,a.dag()] = \sum_{n=0}^(N-1) |n><n| - N|N><N| (you can check this by writing out these operators as projectors onto fock states, you will notice a*a.dag() is missing a term due to the truncation that should cancel with a term in a.dag()*a). Similarly putting the creation and annihilation operators into the position/momentum definition of the Hamiltonian, you find H = sum_{n=0}^(N-1)(n+0.5) |n><n| + N/2 |N><N|. Hence, since you truncated at 9 photons in your example, there is a degeneracy of the 4.5 eigenvalue. I am not sure if there is much can be done about this in general, perhaps the discussion I linked above might be useful. The main message I suppose is always take a larger cut-off than you think you might need, particularly if you are relying on the commutation relations to simplify things for you (which, given your example, can be a bad idea some times!). . I guess there is an interesting question about what is the best practice in these things, e.g., if you have a non-linear model, what form is it best to put it in before moving to a truncated basis? given your example, I would expect something like normal ordering to be better.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770:224,error,error,224,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770,1,['error'],['error']

For example in the Monte Carlo solver, the `map` option decides which of these functions is used, allowing users to switch easily between serial and parallel execution. These functions also come with error handling already, and they select a default number of processes based on the CPU count.

I had a poke around in discussion forums for numpy and scipy, and it seems like the problem is that they throw an exception when they decide L is ""exactly singular"" (which technically it is). Sometimes numerical rounding errors prevent this exception, as occurs in larger systems, or adding a finite frequency, so it tries to solve it anyway and succeeds, because the projector Q on the right-hand side guarantees a solution.

Availability,"Hi,. Thanks for digging into this! Given the docstring of `qutip.propagator`, this behavior was unexpected for me https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/propagator.py#L62-L76. Changing the propagator to consider a list with a single element as a single float value (`[t]` would be the same as `t`) would break the current API and could eventually break some scripts built using QuTiP and using the fact that `qutip.propagator` of `[t]` gives identity. The best way to fix this would probably be to edit the docstring to emphasize the expected behavior for a single `t` value and for a list of times. P.S.: Not directly related to this issue but when looking for QuTiP doc on search engines, it often sends to documentation for old versions of QuTiP. Typically http://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/apidoc/functions.html#module-qutip.propagator.

Availability,"I agree with this, with some additional points:; 1. `QobjEvo` also needs to be handled by `__matmul__`, but this should be handled by returning `NotImplemented`, and letting `QobjEvo.__rmul__` dispatch it to `QobjEvo.__rmatmul__`.; 1. however we choose to do this, `__mul__` should return `NotImplemented` if the other element can't be handled correctly; it shouldn't raise an exception by itself. The ""Pythonic"" way is to try/catch an exception in handling, but this just means we need to be sure that all `__mul__` methods do proper error checking, and _do_ reject invalid input rather than just silently doing weird stuff.; 1. what do we want to do in response to being multiplied with Numpy arrays? We have to be careful, because otherwise we might do very different things depending on whether we're being multiplied from the left or right by the Numpy array, which isn't really desirable. My first instinct is to say we should make ourselves appear as a scalar type to Numpy, so it broadcasts the multiplication over the scalar values in its array. To do that, we may need to play a little with `__array__`, `__array_ufunc__` and `__array_function__`, and return `NotImplemented` from `Qobj.__mul__(array)`. I think this maybe gives the most useful behaviour? I can't imagine a situation where it would make sense for a data-layer type to accept a Numpy array in a scalar-multiplication routine, and doing things this way allows people to use the broadcasting support of Numpy for convient looping. Just for posterity, I'm really strongly against any automatic promotion to `Qobj`, with the exception of handling scalar numbers in `__add__` and `__sub__`, where mathematical convention is that they mean the relevant identity operator scaled by the scalar. Having that is also necessary to have `sum()` work with `Qobj` ergonomically.

Availability,"I completely agree with you that random tests really aren't the right way to go in general, but right now our problem is that basically QuTiP's entire testing suite is based on randomised tests, and that's an awful lot of technical debt to overcome any time soon :(. . The `dnorm` tests have historically been a huge problem, even though basically nobody's worked on `dnorm` for a long long time now (for context, see in particular #880 and #874). We don't actually even know if the failures in `dnorm` are deterministic and reproducible, although it turns out that I had a brief look into this when I joined as a GSoC student about a year ago... I don't remember doing it at all!. I know this is super inelegant and not the perfect method, but it's kind of a nasty trade-off - I don't have time to really dig into `dnorm` (a topic I know almost nothing about) to work out an appropriate solution to temperamental errors, we do want `dnorm` to be tested since we're shipping it, and the slight flakiness keeps causing us test suite failures about 1 in 10 times. I'm somewhat opposed to fixing the random seed because having the variance over several test runs does actually help us cover more ground (eventually) - fixing it to a ""known good"" seed actually seems to me to be more of a mask of potential problems than this. Of note: the pytest plugin I'm using reports the number of reruns it performed in the analysis at the bottom - they show up in a yellow alongside the ""skips"" and ""xfails"" - so it's not completely hidden. I'd love to have a property-based testing suite like hypothesis up and running - that definitely seems like the proper solution to this in the end. In the meantime, I'm open to swapping to a fixed random seed if you think that's much better - testing is one place where I'm really aware of my lack of formal experience in software engineering, so I'm basically just learning as I go.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227:483,failure,failures,483,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227,4,"['error', 'failure', 'mask']","['errors', 'failures', 'mask']"

When that previously happened, the package actually worked, it just reported that error. My guess is that this happens if `pyximport.install()` has already been activated when `qutip` is imported, and consequently the test in `__init__.py` as to whether `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs` is importable causes this error. It should not be able to even attempt to import it _unless_ `pyximport` has been turned on, and if it's been turned on by something other than QuTiP, then it should fail with a `numpy` header file error instead (this is something we should probably fix too, but I've not noticed it before).

Availability,"I don't have xvfb (pytest-xvfb) installed specifically for qutip, but it is used by other packages (The general use of pytest-xvfb is to facilitate testing of GUI, graphical or windowing functionality without having an normal Xserver active. That is, it can be useful for automated CI testing of gui packages, for instance in chroots or cloud CI infrastructure). Since qutip doesn't use xvfb directly this bug won't be a problem for general CI testing, where only qutip is loaded on a cloud instance (for instance Debian testing done at https://ci.debian.net/packages/q/qutip/). But before I upload a package to the Debian infrastructure, I like to run the tests on my own system to be confident they're likely to pass. So this is where the problem happens, running tests on my own system, where I have pytest-xvfb installed for testing other packages. (pytest has this bad habit of loading all available plugins whether or not they're actually used by the tests being run. It's quite annoying actually. It would be better if it only loaded plugins specified in conftest.py). So the use case is running the qutip tests on my own system, where pytest-xvfb simply happens to be installed for other purposes not related to qutip. There are ways of working around the problem, for instance the `--no-xvfb` option could be explicitly added to the `pytest` command line.

If you look are the sparse eigen solver, for a 100x100 matrix with only 10 non-zero values, all along the diagonal, it does not find any` 0` eigen values: there are about 89x `~e-36`, 1x `~e-17` and the 10 non-zeros values. So the `sqrt(~e-17)` is pure numerical error and appear in the test at around 3e-9. ; I ran the test a few thousand times and it fails about 23% of the time, at `tol=3e-8`, it fails about 0.2% of the time and the max is 3.7e-8.

Availability,"I don't think this is the right way to solve your problem, but we probably should be consistent. `Qobj` is not a container for arbitrary data, and a 1x1 `Qobj` basically should never exist. If I remember correctly, the auto-promotion to `Qobj` is to avoid breaking backwards compatibility, because 4.x doesn't use the `@` syntax at all. We almost certainly should be moving to remove that ""feature"", not add to it - it should never work with compound Hilbert spaces (we should be safe-by-default), and trying to detect special behaviour on 1x1 inputs just leads to weird edge cases and breakages all over the place. You probably want some sort of different mechanism for deciding what types a `Qobj.data` instance can accept in `mul`. At the moment, the test is `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`, but you want to accept `tensorflow.Variable` if the backing data is TF-like.

Availability,"I don't want the way to catch error depend on the map, `serial_map` and `loky_map` both return the error of the first failing iteration and stop there. Having `parallel_map` failing differently will mean that every time we want to catch an error in `mcsolve`, etc. we will have to catch both the expected error and the custom `ParallelMapException`. It also hide the kind of error and prevent us to act on it. I still think that stopping the map and returning the first error is the best options. It will ensure that all map functions fail the same way. In our case, the raised exceptions should be consistent so we should not need run all iteration to see every ways it can fail. And we don't waste computing time to compute result that will not be returned. Another options would to not raise any error and return the finished iteration. For mcsolve, we could have a result returning 99% of the asked trajectories with the note that 1% failed because of overwork from the solver. Trowing away all the work done for one error feels bad.

Availability,"I had a quick stab at this by adding a Metaclass to Qobj (I tried doing this within `__new__` but could not get it to work. If it's possible I accept suggestions). ; I am also unsure if your constructor `Qobj` is supposed to be called with positional, kwargs or a combination of both. If it was only kwargs the implementation could be more terse. I assumed that the `copy` argument gets passed as part of `__qutip_qobj_interface__`, as in the conversion it might be necessary to copy anyway so the downstream implementor is responsible for taking care of the copy if requested. ```python; class QobjMetaclass(type):; def __call__(cls, inpt=None, dims=None, shape=None,; type=None, isherm=None, copy=True,; fast=False, superrep=None, isunitary=None):. if isinstance(inpt, Qobj):; pass; elif hasattr(inpt, ""__qutip_qobj_interface__""):; inpt_data = inpt.__qutip_qobj_interface__(copy=copy). inpt = inpt_data['matrix']; dims = inpt_data['dims']; copy = False. obj = cls.__new__(cls, inpt, dims, shape, type, isherm, copy, fast,; superrep, isunitary); obj.__init__(inpt, dims, shape, type, isherm, copy, fast,; superrep, isunitary); return obj. class Qobj(object, metaclass=QobjMetaclass):; ...; ```; I'm quite sure this implementation can be improved, however. On the NetKet side, the implementation is very simple. At the moment we only support operators from H->H.; ```python; class AbstractOperator:; ... ; def __qutip_qobj_interface__(self, dims, copy=True):; return {'matrix': stacked_rows_to_stacked_cols(self.hilbert, self.to_sparse()),; 'dims': [list(self.hilbert.shape), list(self.hilbert.shape)]}; ```. This already is quite nice and allows for quick and simple interoperability. Some comments/questions:; - Qutip uses stacked columns (column major) ordering for the tensor products, as opposed to NumPy `kron` ordering that is stacked rows, right? ; - To signal that an object is a super-operator (Liouvillian) is it sufficient to pass a correctly constructed `dims` or I should also provide `s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-829966601:498,down,downstream,498,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-829966601,1,['down'],['downstream']

In this sort of triangular workflow where you're proposing PRs that might not be merged as-is, you need to treat our repository as the single source of truth - you should never change your `master` branch except by doing `git pull` to our repository, so you can't get out of sync. Since you've now developed on the top of an incorrect tip, it'll be a bit difficult for you to untangle if you're not very familiar with `git`. You _can_ do it with rebasing or cherry-picking techniques to keep what you've done, but in this particular case (and there's no way you could have known this), I was actually just about to publish PR #1490 that makes all these same changes in `test_metrics.py`, but also goes a lot further in rewriting the tests in a more pytest-y style. It might be better for you if you reset your repository to match ours exactly, and then start again using the proper branching structure for the superoperator and tensor tests you wanted to look at. Perhaps you could have a look at #1490 as well to see how I go about parametrising tests and organising everything to keep it tidy (not saying that my code is perfect by a long shot, and the concept of ""random"" tests is questionable overall, but it's what we've got at the moment). Remember as well that readibility is a big concern. Using an automated tool to enforce pep8 compliance often won't get you the best results - our real style requirement is that it's easy to read, so linebreaks should be in sensible places (that still abide by pep8).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778:332,down,down,332,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix. To do that:; ```python; # initial setup; H = qutip.tensor(...); c_ops = [qutip.tensor(...)]. original_dimensions = H.dims.copy(); new_dimensions = list(H.shape). H.dims = new_dimensions; for c_op in c_ops:; c_op.dims = new_dimensions. outputs = qutip.propagator(H, times, c_ops=c_ops); for op in outputs:; # the ops are superoperators, so have expanded dimensions; op.dims = [original_dimensions, original_dimensions]; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199:1636,toler,tolerance,1636,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199,1,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"I quite like this. I find the operator-to-vector-vector-to-operator casting too cumbersome. I also think its OK notation wise, since we typically use parenthesis when superoperators act on operators. Another option however would be to add this functionality to `Qobj.__mul__`, such that `Qobj.__mul__` is interpreted as 'acting on' if an operator is multiplied from the left on a state, or a superoperator from the left on an operator. Leaving out the parenthesis is also pretty standard notation. For the `Qobj.__call__` solution, I don't like so much that ""A(B)"" is interpreted as ""A B A.dag()"" when A and B are both operators though.

Availability,"I think `hypothesis` is the best method here in the long term, but it will most likely have to be a long-term goal. I think the main pro in favour of it is that it actually is making an attempt to remove randomness; it's attempting to comprehensively test a spanning set of input parameters, rather than just Monte-Carlo'ing our way through and hoping. There's a couple of points which make it difficult to implement:. 1. QuTiP can be quite fragile with respect to unexpected input formats, particularly in older parts of the code.; 2. Various components are only accurate up to some tolerance, and the error propagation to work out how that corresponds to useful measurable quantities can be rather tricky. Those are certainly both solvable problems, and point 1 in particular is just general improvement of usability. The second point is about designing the tests well, which again is certainly doable, but will take a while (it takes long enough just to refactor them, let alone a total rewrite of large chunks of them!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663:584,toler,tolerance,584,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663,2,"['error', 'toler']","['error', 'tolerance']"

However, if i increase the limit from 1e-10 to 1e-05 it work, that is it returns a zero eseries.; In the original case it doesn't enter into this _if_ and than returns an _es_ series which es.ampl[0] returns that error. ### Edit:; I replaced the `return estidy(out)` in line 205 of the same file with `return out`, and it seems to work!. ### Edit 2:; More precisely the problem is on the tolerance of tidy.

Availability,"I think it's quite important to understand why this happened. Previously we reliably had an exactly correct result, and now we don't. This particular check for `p != 0` of a float is I think okay because it's there specially to avoid division by exactly zero. I can think of at least two plausible scenarios:. 1. The issue was caused by the removal of auto_tidyup, in which case I think either a setting like this with an explicit check in either the measurement functions or the simulator are good solutions (although it should be possible to override the setting on a per-call basis, just like with atol). 2. The issue was caused by the removal of the data layer mathematical operations, and in particular, by the replacement of `data / value` by `data.mul(data, 1 / value)`, in which case I think the solution is to add a `div` operation to the data classes so that we don't lose this accuracy.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1656#issuecomment-917229773:76,reliab,reliably,76,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1656#issuecomment-917229773,1,['reliab'],['reliably']

Availability,"I think the module should really be `qutip.testing` (or `qutip.test` if the name's already taken), not `qutip.core.data.testing`, if you're going to add one. It's very likely to be the case in the future (if it isn't already) that you'll need additional dependencies to define the tests, and you don't want to force _all_ runtime users to have them to install QuTiP. If you put the package in a separate top-level module, it's _far_ easier to separate out all the code, and have `qutip/__init__.py` not import `qutip.testing`, so things won't break. Also, tests generally need to work with a fully imported version of the module. If we start putting testing infrastructure in the core, we're going to encode a whole lot of cyclical dependencies right away, or end up with `testing` modules scattered all across the codebase, for no real gain. For discovery: that would only happen during test generation, which comes after importing the modules and defining the classes, so you'd still be able to define tolerances and influence how the tests ran. The problem with _not_ having discovery is that it becomes very easy to forget to test a function, and with so much of the machinery automated, it's also easy to forget it when reviewing a PR. That's particularly true once you have external contributors writing these sorts of things - we have it in Qiskit, where people add things to our ""standard equivalence library"", and new contributors and new reviewers don't know where all the different tests are, so our discovery tests have helped catch bugs. That happens even with super experienced team members. I'd argue that code coverage metrics are possibly a better way of detecting missing tests - that fails safe if you add broken code and forget to test it, whereas having to specify the tests explicitly means you can accidentally add broken code to a dispatcher and not know, if you forgot to add the test.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735:1004,toler,tolerances,1004,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735,1,['toler'],['tolerances']

Availability,"I think there are two separate issues here. . As for the fortran module, it's true that the it adds a lot of build complexity, but most users do not need it and can easily install qutip without it. There is a case for removing it from qutip and put it in a separate module, but think this should be low priority, since it would require non-negligible amount work, would break backwards compatibility (it should bump next release to 4.0), and does not really provide any new features (other than a less complex code base). There might users who rely on it and for them it might be annoying if we remove it. So I would vote for postponing it until there are very strong arguments for removing it. As for the topic of this issue, I think that qutip should follow the lead of NumPy, even if it breaks backwards compatibility in the configuration methods, so that users that are familiar with NumPy and related projects does not have any surprises when using qutip. Also, if I understand correctly, this would mostly change how one configure and build against blas libraries such as openblas?

Availability,"I tried some experiments with elementwise exp with numpy to see if mkl did any parallel processing. It did not seem to. scipy.linalg.expm claims to use the Pade approximation. There used to be a expm2 (that used diagonalisation) and an expm3 (method?) but these have been deprecated. The scipy docs claim that the method used in expm is ""numerically more robust"". In the control modules we either use a eigendecomp (diagonalisation) method or scipy.linalg.expm_frechet as we typically need to compute propagators (which either uses the eigendecomp or is provided by the frechet deriv) . Frechet also uses some Pade approximation. I think the Pade method uses something like a LU decomp, but would need more research. It would always be more efficient to use the eigendecomp if it has been computed already. My guess is that if parallel LU decomp provides much (x100) faster eigendecomp, then the diagonalisation method would be much faster than expm. However, some experimentation would be needed to verify. . I am told that there are many methods of computing expm, and is there is much numerical research into it. It seems strange that scipy only offer us one method. The spinach control library (http://spindynamics.org/Spinach.php) reputedly has some interesting methods of computing expm. A quick Google search found https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/354, which shows that scipy considered adding a method kwarg, but have parked the idea. We currently have multiple methods in qutip based. I assume there must have been some motivation for writing our own sparse matrix functions for expm.

Availability,"I tried your suggestions but unfortunately nothing changes. I think my issue is with the way the rotating frame approximation is being implemented. Prior to this, my issue was that the graph couldn't be plotted over a large time scale because w0 is so high, so I added (w-w0) to H0. That fixed it, but I'm not sure how that affects the H1_coeff function. Is it as simple as including a (w-w0) term there as well, or do I need to adjust it some other way? As you can see, the pulse does exist, but for some reason nothing I change in the code causes the pulse to affect the graphs in any way. . Also, I realized that the heaviside function may not actually be appropriate for this situation. My goal is to create a pulse that spikes up and dies down, but the heaviside function is a step function so it spikes up and stays there. Do you know if qutip has any functions for such pulses?. ![k](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29261370/113001273-42ce2600-9136-11eb-84f3-a4bcdd7c458f.PNG)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810278045:744,down,down,744,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810278045,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"I understand completely!. I'd probably just go to `int64` with your internal CSR implementation for the moment. Would it be very easy to have the `int32`/`int64` boiled down to a single compile-time flag, for those people that compile QuTiP manually and feel they really need the smaller `int32` matrices? The pre-compiled pip/conda releases could be `int64`. That might be a simple way to provide some support for ""both"". Somehow, I thought that SciPy would put a lot more emphasis on performance, and do things like Kronecker products without conversion. It would seem that SciPy should be the place to really optimize the sparse linear algebra implementation, including all the possible combinations like `CSR * DIA`. Then everyone could build on top of that, making custom sparse-matrix implementation unnecessary. Maybe when someone gets some serious funding for working on QuTiP, encapsulating all of this better would be doable. So, just something to keep in mind before bolting on too many things onto the existing custom implementation (like multiple sparse and full storage formats). Once you open up that can of worms, it just might be better to re-design `Oobj.data` to have a very broad base (e.g. SciPy), and keep the custom CSR as an optional, highly efficient implementation for the special case, maybe in a separate package.

Availability,"I'd be interested in providing these changes. I have a few points to ask/consider:; 1. which function is meant by `zero_oper()`? I can't find any reference to it in the code, and judging by the name, I'd guess it's equivalent to `qzero()`, which already supports this.; 2. should we extend the automatic tensoring to other operators, e.g. `create()`, `destroy()`, and so forth? I can't necessarily think of any particular use-case, but _not_ having it causes an odd inconsistency with `qeye()`.; 3. for `projection()` and `basis()` in particular: should the interface allow only scalar `m` and `n`, which must be the same for all dimensions, or should there be broadcasting rules? The latter seems like a more useful choice to me, with the rules for all arguments being:; - if `m` is a list, then `max_len == len(m)`; - if `m` is a scalar, then `m = [m] * max_len`. For example, this would provide `tensor(basis(2, 0), basis(2, 1)) == basis(2, [0, 1]) == basis([2,2], [0, 1])`, which seems the ""least surprising"" to me.; 4. should there be error-checking that supplied scalars/lists are the correct format?

I actually think this is a true failure; the default solver `rtol = 1e-6`, but here we're using `rtol=1e-7` as the test, so the test is bugged (it's probably not the only one, and I may have missed some of these in `mcsolve` too).

Availability,"I'll add that it might be worth addressing the fact that there are two common conventions for representing quantum states as tensors that each have their pros and cons. Perhaps this would be better placed in a separate issue, but I'll explain here anyway. Consider a joint state like $` |\psi_1 \psi_2 \rangle \langle \psi_3 \psi_4 | `$ where the dimensions of $` |\psi_i\rangle `$ are $` d_i `$. Two common representations of this abstract state as a tensor are; 1. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle) \otimes (\langle \psi_3| \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $`(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)`$; 2. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_3|) \otimes (|\psi_2\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $` (d_1, d_3, d_2, d_4) `$. These two conventions essentially correspond to the ""super"" and ""choi"" representations for channels. Representation 1. is nice when you are doing most of your calculations with pure states, but then want a density matrix towards the end, which you can do with just `np.tensordot(my_ket_tensor, np.conj(my_ket_tensor), 0)`. Representation 2. is nice when you are working with density matrices and want to combine multiple subsystems, which you can do with `np.tensordot(my_density_tensor_1, my_density_tensor_2, 0)`. Doing either of these operations in the other representation involves very error-prone index permutation in my experience. When I said above that these two conventions should be ""addressed"" in some way, I was intentionally vague because I'm honestly not sure what the best way to do that would be. One option would be to simply mention it in the user guide somewhere, perhaps near the section on the Super and Choi representations. Another would be to support both conventions via optional parameters like `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='super')` or `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='choi')`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867:1341,error,error-prone,1341,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867,1,['error'],['error-prone']

Availability,"I'm glad that you like the `__call__` option for `super(oper)`; my thought there was that having `__mul__` cas op-to-vec and vec-to-op could lead to some surprising behavior, especially when manipulating Choi states. As for the proposed semantics for `oper(oper)`, my thought behind making that return `A * B * A.dag()` is that this behavior would then be identical to `to_super(A)(B)`, such that it would be a consistent with previously-used semantics within QuTiP. In particular, all of the superoperator representation conversions so far treat `type=""oper""` Qobj instances as acting by conjugation. Though I agree that adopting `A(B) = A * B * A.dag()` for the `oper(oper)` case could raise some potential for confusion, I think that it may be worth it for consistency, especially since `__call__` would not conflict with any previous code.

Availability,"I'm not at all a fan of making tests part of the public interface like this. It's something that we make absolutely no stability guarantees about, and coupling downstream packages to our own tests just sounds like a recipe for disaster - if we find a bug in main QuTiP and need to change tests or add methods (which we should be able to do completely freely), we're going to inject a ton of extra code into downstream packages, and may completely break them. To be honest, I'm not even wild about how we distribute our tests as part of the module code at all, but that's what we've got. It _could_ be ok if you import the test case base, and redefine your tests from there. We still don't make any stability guarantees about that, but it's conceivable that we could (though of course, the problem of ""what if we need to add methods"" persists). That would also solve your problems about saying you can't import individual tests.

If there are any important use-cases where this property would be important we could reconsider this. Do you have any examples in mind?.

Availability,"I'm not sure solution 3 will work as easily as this - if the user's `scipy.linalg.eigh` is broken, then calling it doesn't help, surely?. Also, I can reproduce the segfaults with both `np.ascontiguousarray` and `np.asfortranarray` on my machine, but it is a size of 64 that seems to reliably do me in. Script to reproduce:; ```python; import numpy as np; from scipy.linalg import eigh. def random_hermitian(n):; h = np.random.rand(n, n) + 1j*np.random.rand(n, n); return h + np.conj(h.T). for n in range(1, 101):; print(n); for _ in [None]*100:; x = eigh(np.ascontiguousarray(random_hermitian(n))); ```; and this segfaults on `n=64` reliably with the `pip` version of `scipy` (linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.7), and always succeeds with the `conda` version (linked against MKL 2019.4). Both `scipy` versions are 1.4.1 here. I did the most bare-bones install to test this:; ```; $ conda create -n blastest python; $ conda activate blastest; $ pip install scipy; $ python blas.py; ```; where `blas.py` is the repro script above. Doing this, `pip` pulls me OpenBLAS 0.3.7. Looking at the source of OpenBLAS, the whole heavy-lifting implementation is in Fortran - there's the classic LAPACKe C wrapper around the core Fortran LAPACK, but everything eventually goes down to the Fortran. If it helps, it's an out-of-bounds access error that causes the segfault for me, and the address it's trying to access doesn't look like dummy nonsense (`0x101b95010`). I'm pretty sure it's a nasty Mac/OpenBLAS bug. If the problem is particularly in `zheevr` we could swap the call to `eig` (instead of `eigh`) for Mac only, which should hopefully sidestep the problem, because it'll call `zgeev` instead. All recent pip installs of `scipy` link against OpenBLAS, so there's not much that can sidestep it there, other than mandating `conda` usage, because you can't relink `scipy` to decent libraries without compiling from source.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955:283,reliab,reliably,283,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955,4,"['down', 'error', 'reliab']","['down', 'error', 'reliably']"
Availability,"I'm sorry I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment, but just to add an extra point (that it looks like I didn't think about before): if we _do_ add this, then any method that requires an unconditional `import qutip` in downstream packages probably isn't a suitable solution - `import qutip` already takes far too long (though a lot of this is importing various parts of `scipy`, which another library might do on our behalf), and it means that they'd have to do their own import checking to handle optional dependencies. In that sense, (ab)using Python's duck-typing with a magic method might be the best way to break the dependency/import problem. I'm definitely still against implicit conversion to `Qobj` in pretty much any situation - I can imagine we could define a safe, fairly forward-compatible interface for letting people do `qutip.Qobj(x)`, but as it stands, that's the limit that I'd want the interface to be used for. I particularly am really against the idea of implicit conversion. I don't see an advantage to allowing QuTiP functions to act implicitly on other objects; it means our own functions are slower (because we have to explicitly test inputs on _everything_), and it restricts us more from improving `Qobj`'s internals, because we have to maintain compatibility with the interface. We'd never really be able to output anything _other_ than a `Qobj` without this, so there's no reason not to just have the user convert the inputs to `Qobj` explicitly themselves - that isolates the efficiency penalty so you only pay it if you need it, and it'll likely be clearer in the end anyway, because explicit is better for following the logic than implicit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301:227,down,downstream,227,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301,1,['down'],['downstream']

There is a question here of whether we should specify our minimum supported numpy in ""install_requires"" in ""setup.cfg"" or not. - The majority of our test matrix should *build* qutip with oldest-supported-numpy to match what we distribute. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest numpy we require (i.e. oldest NEP) and one for the most recent (i.e. latest numpy). . - We should include at least one test run for the oldest Python we support and one for the newest. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest SciPy we support and one for the newest. - The NEP doesn't say anything about SciPy, but I propose we select the oldest SciPy that supports our oldest NEP numpy.

Availability,"If we don't do `del numpy` in qutip's `__init__.py`, then doing this works:. ```; from import qutip *; numpy.func(...); ```. because numpy was imported but not deleted before the end of qutips init file, and it will be exported form qutip as a global symbol in qutips namespace (which is the callers global name space if called as above). However, this is not a desired behaviour of a module to do like this: importing qutip shouldn't impose that numpy is imported in any particular way (even though qutip uses numpy internally). For example, if a user prefer to import numpy as `np`, then it is pointless that qutip exposes numpy as `numpy` as well. It because even weirder when an import pattern like `import qutip as q` is used, because as it is now then numpy is available through `q.numpy`, which is unnecessary and causes problem with for example nose unit testing of qutip module (because it finds numpy and run all numpy tests as well) and also with module autocompletion in for example spyder and ipython. For these and many other similar reasons, it is neatest if qutip only exports its own symbols, and if a users requires any symbols of other packages they should be explicitly imported from those packages.

For example, the ""naive"" way of implementing a relative tolerance would take the absolute value of a complex number, but that involves a floating-point square root, which is a very slow operation. That's likely partly why the current version compares real and imaginary components separately, even though the sparsity structure is only improved if _both_ go to zero. In a two-pass operation you'd sqrt twice for every entry (naively - all the square roots are very avoidable), and I'd start to worry that that really _could_ dominate small system operations.

Availability,"In general in pytest we use the bare keyword `assert` for almost everything. All the functions in `np.testing` are from the ""before times"", when test tooling wasn't as good as it is nowadays - they were a big improvement on available warning messages back before 2015. Nowadays, though, `pytest` does introspection on assertion failures, so it has even better message reporting than the `np.testing` functions, and it lets you write much clearer code. For example, `assert_equal(x, y)` is much better spelled in pytest as `assert x == y`, because it's much faster to read and pytest does better error reporting for it. Similarly, testing for exceptions is better with; ```python; with pytest.raises(ValueError):; call_that_raises(1, ""hello, world""); ```; as opposed to the numpy form `np.testing.assert_raises(ValueError, call_that_raises, 1, ""hello, world"")` - the pytest one is much easier to read, and the error message is better. The only numpy one we still use is `np.testing.assert_allclose` when we're comparing several numpy arrays. That's just because `pytest` doesn't have a good function that's aware of multidimensional arrays (at least not one that I know). This file still has a load of old numpy testing code in it (e.g. `np.testing.assert_equal`) because it was written quite a long time ago, when that was the recommended way of doing things. We're changing over slowly, so we can take advantage of all the nice features of pytest. In this case, I changed `np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y, atol=tol)` to `assert abs(x - y) < tol`. I removed `np.testing.assert_allclose`, because that gives the mistaken impression that we're comparing arrays (we're not, we're comparing two scalars). I could have changed it to `assert x == pytest.approx(y, tol=tol)`, except in this case the test file hasn't been converted to `pytest` style yet, and I wanted to keep the total change of this PR as small as possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671:224,avail,available,224,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671,4,"['avail', 'error', 'failure']","['available', 'error', 'failures']"

Your `qutip.about()` output shows that you have installed version 5.0.3 on the one PC and version 4.6.2 on the other. Version 5 was recently released, and it is a major update and changes many of the internals of QuTiP. Old code should still work with version 5 in the majority of cases, but it is not guaranteed to always work. For old code, you might therefore prefer to use version 4 (the latest release of version 4 is v4.7.6).; * Your notebooks are rather long, and for a person who has not written them it can be hard to figure out what they do. If you would like to investigate in detail where the different behavior comes from, I would recommend to try to boil it down to a *short, self-contained* example script that gives different results in versions 4 and 5.; * The differing plots show values with a magnitude of $10^{-14}$ or so. That is rather small. By default, QuTiP's solvers use tolerances of $10^{-12}$, so you should not expect the numerical results to have a higher precision than that.

Availability,"Knowing the tensor structure is still necessary for enforcing the Hilbert spaces are of the correct dimensions, even if the resulting state can't be written as a product of states on individual spaces. I think there's a lot more design to do to work out a sensible data structure which can really take advantage of this lazy representation, but my morning-after reaction to this is that it's very non-trivial without a lot of code duplication. It's easy enough to imagine how it will work for operators of structure `[scalar, oper, scalar] * [scalar, scalar, oper] -> [scalar, oper, oper]` - in this case the final result is fully expanded in the last two states, and not in the first. It's much trickier dealing with `[oper, scalar, scalar] * [scalar, scalar, oper] -> [oper, scalar, oper]`. In this case, since there's a subspace in between them, you need a specifically ""lazy"" Kronecker product. I suspect that this would have to be supported via either a completely separate `tensor` mechanism, or the mechanisms which currently underpin the data-layer `kron` would have to be revisited. At least at first, I think that's a very large undertaking, and it would really need a lot of careful design to ensure that we don't slow anything down, or balloon the amount of code to be maintained.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320#issuecomment-658094225:1239,down,down,1239,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320#issuecomment-658094225,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"My thinking on this basically comes down to two points. First, the behavior of `composite` is explicitly not the same as that of `tensor()` or `super_tensor()`, as it's a common usecase to compose operators defined on different subsystems without reference to representation. While I agree that it would be good to have more generic wire-bending support in QuTiP, I think that's likely out of scope for this particular feature, as it would require some significant rethinking of how `dims` is currently implemented. Second, I think that it's entirely defensible that the current behavior of `composite` promotes operators by `spre() * spost()`, as this is consistent with the view that superoperators are matrix representations of group action by conjugation. That is, `composite` returns the composite of the same group action applied to each of several subsystems, though the action can be more general for `type='super'` arguments. This could perhaps be made more clear by renaming `composite` to `composite_oper` or similar, but I think that the _behavior_ of the current function is correct and consistent, if admittedly, poorly described.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276:36,down,down,36,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Not to discourage you from contributing, but there's already been some movement on #1208 in #1209.

About pep8 changes: I'm not a maintainer, but it might be a good idea to be conservative about changing actual public APIs in the name of pep8. Changing public APIs that work fine means the users, who are the reason we're writing the code in the first place, have to adjust, and the pep8 spec explicitly warns against breaking backwards compatibility to match the pep. `N` is fairly consistent within `qutip` for the number of qubits, and the `U` in `U_list` refers to unitary matrices, which are conventionally a capital `U` in mathematical writing.

Availability,"Note: in theory you can install QuTiP from the test PyPI server right now by doing; ```; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; ```; (that's just the name - you still do `import qutip`) but since it's on the ""wrong"" server, you first have to manually install `numpy` and `scipy`. When it's released properly on PyPI it'll handle the dependencies correctly - this is only an artifact of being on the testing server. Running that command will install a binary version with no compilation, and should work on any (reasonable) Linux machine, Mac (possibly not M1 chips) and Windows. It's possible you may get an error about `ndarray size changed ... this may indicate binary incompatibility` - if so, either force `numpy` up to the new 1.20 or down to 1.19 (whichever one you don't have). This was a breaking change in numpy 1.20. Per my reading of the release notes, it won't be an issue provided in the future we always build against `numpy>=1.20` (even when using lower `numpy` at runtime) because the new version updates a certain C-API macro to take into account the possibility of runtime variability. I have pushed an additional change to the build requirements to ensure this always happens. This has another knock-on effect: numpy 1.20 only supports Python 3.7+ (released June 2017). Currently, officially QuTiP supports Python 3.6, but I think it's reasonable to follow numpy's footsteps and **drop support for python 3.6 from qutip 5.0**. It's offset by gaining support for 3.9.

Availability,"Oh yeah, I totally agree with that perspective - it's in part why I've gone on my little crusade over the past couple of weeks to remove all the warnings and errors from all the build processes. What do you think a sensible strategy is for handling bug fixes that touches code that issues complaints? CodeClimate will typically restate its complaint if you change a line that contributes to it (e.g. here I changed a ""return"" statement in a function that has too many). I guess there's either ""maintainers state whether any particular PR is acceptable with a failing warning""; ""write a [skip ci] commit message"" (or whatever it's called); or ""any PR that touches complained-about code must fix the error"". Without any experience, to my mind it seems like points 1 and 2 are basically the same, but point 1 gives the power to override to maintainers, and point 2 to contributors - seems like version 2 works well in a business where ""everyone"" is trusted to modify the code, but in the distribued opensource world, maybe not? Point 3 seems ideal in principle, but it seems like it would make it very hard to have first-time contributors do anything with older parts of the library - there'd be a huge onus to completely overhaul functionality, even just to fix small stuff.

Availability,"Ok there are two issues here. 1. Scipy `atol` keyword argument has only been introduced in Scipy 1.1, the latest version. So we should bump it to 1.1 or should do nothing at all and ignore the warnings. 2. The tests are failing for the sparse eigenval function in [`qutip.tests.test_sp_eigs`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/tests/test_sp_eigs.py#L45). So there is something else which is breaking and this is some weird segmentation fault issue, see below. Note that the test itself was known to give trouble before. But for some reason, with Python 3+ and the latest scipy, everything works fine. . I am very much in favor of dropping support for Python 2.7 as even Numpy seems to be gearing up to drop Python 2.7.

Availability,"Ok, I think I may have some more information. I am fairly sure that this is the same bug as #1120, #963 and #944 (which I believe was not actually ever fixed). I'm going to put the information here. My working theory is currently that this is a MKL bug on Mac. For posterity, let me just dump out some information. ## Things you should know if you've not worked with segfaults before. - `Abort trap 6`, `Segmentation fault` and a few other points can all be from the same cause; - Segmentation faults are typically caused by reading or writing to memory that isn't owned by our process. These often occur by reading/writing too much data to an allocated pointer, or trying to read/write a memory location where the location was read from uninitialised memory.; - Segfaults will not always reliably occur. It's _very_ difficult to prove that swapping tools ""fixes"" a segfault; it can often just move around enough allocations to mask the problem, not fix it.; - Python stack traces are likely to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`.

That probably means that we're technically not following the rules at the moment. That said, my understanding is that licences are just a general statement of rights that are given to everyone. If we get explicit permission from the creator of the library to include it in this library with a rider that this particular section cannot be copied or used in a public project except under GPL-v2 terms, then I think we'd be fine (except that might make it super annoying for downstream projects...). In general I think the primary reason that we can't release GPL'd code under a BSD licence is that the BSD licence doesn't have the restriction that source code must be made available. I _think_, however, that since the circuit drawing isn't an integral part of QuTiP, it would be allowed for us to distribute this portion as a stand-alone extension to QuTiP which is individually GPL'd, even if we couldn't get a relicensed version of the LaTeX package.

Availability,"Removing list and forcing dict does not feels making things nicer... Being forced to use dict is mostly a nuisance for me. Presently we support both list ans dict output without much issues, there are very few place that would have issue supporting multiple interfaces. (I can only think of `plot_expectation`.). But how about using `namedtuple`?. It act as a list for loop and numpy, but elements can be called by both the number and name, and I like having result's output somewhat immutable. The biggest issue is that we must provide field names for list inputs... For MC, if e_ops callable return weird things, they will have to choose the option to store all trajectories instead of averaging the result. If they ask for the average or standard derivation of a dict, they will and should get an error, the best we should do is making this error message useful. Custom reduce function could be doable, but probably be a mess, especially if we need one for both `mean` and `std`...

But the solver tolerance is for the state itself, not expectation values and other scalars obtained from them. The test is not to check numerical error.

It's difficult to say that if there's a numerical error then the error will be much greater - I caught some errors in the `test_gates.py` (I think) that were sneaking through because the tolerances were set too high.

Availability,"Right now, QuTiP doesn't support passing `c_ops` as an arbitrary function to `mcsolve`. @Ericgig might have more ideas for other things you may try, but in general to us `mcsolve` you need to have your collapse operators as constant matrices multiplied by time-dependent scalars. Depending on your collapse operators, you may be able to move to an interaction picture such that the collapse operators lose their time-dependence, or move to being scalars multiplied by constant matrices.

Availability,"So, while I agree that having a flexible storage format is a good way to go, the truth of the matter is that no one has time to implement such a big change. SciPy supports both 32 and 64-bit ints, and checks to see which ones are needed at runtime. e.g. a tensor product of two sparse matrices with int32, may need int64 in the result since their shape is larger. We could also do a similar thing, but it is a lot of work. The reason why we no longer use standard SciPy sparse objects is: 1) They tend to have a sizeable overhead when being created and/or manipulated do to redundant safety checks. 2) Many of the sparse operations are not well optimized. Because SciPy supports many different sparse formats, they had to generalize many of their core operations, making them slower. For example, the sparse kronecker product first converts to COO format, does the tensoring, and then converts back to the original format. Our method is much faster. Supporting more than just the current CSR format is also problematic. As already mentioned, there would be type checks, conditionals, and format conversions everywhere. e.g. what happens when DIA * CSR. As usual, available time is the limiting factor here. Support for both int32 and int64 is not that hard, but would take some time. Just int64 would make smaller matrices larger, but would allow for much greater system dimensions. In this later case, it would be a simple switch `int` -> `int64` and `size_t` -> `uint64` in the Cython code, and the fastsparse module (plus probably other places.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667:574,redundant,redundant,574,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667,2,"['avail', 'redundant']","['available', 'redundant']"

Availability,"Sorry I didn't get round to commenting on this PR sooner. Since it's now come up in #1579 around the subject of sorting out licensing in general in QuTiP, let me also note some stuff about that here. #1579 proposes to remove all individual-file licence text, because it is in general redundant, and makes it harder for us to centrally manage our licence. There is some concern (mostly mine), that it will be a little difficult for us to manage additional code which does not sign over copyright to the QuTiP admin team; if we accept it, we will have to keep the notice in perpetuity. This will pose a bit of a Theseus' ship problem for us if we ever want to re-organise the file that contains this code; after how many modifications is the code no longer NASA's, but QuTiP's? As long as it's not _ours_, we can't separate it out into different files, or mix it with other code (say additional implementations). I'm definitely not a lawyer, but I'm worried that will cause us code organisation problems in the future, and while the licence would give us permission to improve the code, it's the reorganisation I'm worried about. Secondly, about the code itself: this sort of local operation is something I absolutely would like to include, but I'm not certain that the form it's in right now is the best, general way to do it. I think this is part of much larger discussion about how to handle tensor networks - for example, at the moment, `targets` is fine for states and operators, but it won't work for superoperators. I'm not sure that this is solvable in an ergonomic way with QuTiP's current dimensions specifiers, but it's something we're definitely going to look into after the initial release of 5.0. Also, there are already several disparate functions in QuTiP that provide sort-of similar functionality, and I think we need to have a proper go at tidying them all up into one cohesive interface. This includes `subsystem_apply` (most similar to this), but also `ptrace` and `partial_tranpose",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566:284,redundant,redundant,284,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566,1,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Sorry for the delay on the docstrings and so on, I think all suggestions should be incorporated now. However, thanks to Paul's suggestion of adapting the tutorial 1e. I realized that I made a ""mistake from the very beggining"", namely the function used to fit the correlation function is only good if the imaginary part of the spectral density is 0 at t=0, because I'm using. $C(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}e^{i c_{k} t}$. so . $C_{R}(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}cos(c_{k} t)$. $C_{I}(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}sin(c_{k} t)$. No matter how many terms I take $C_{I}(0)=0$. I should have realized before but this can be bypassed by excluding $t=0$ from the fit, and starting at a small t, you get a decent fit, as long as you don't look at C(0), and I never check for these situations before. The results of doing this are pretty decent, but updating tutorial 1e I realized it required higher calculation times for the HEOMSolver when compared to using another ansatz for the correlation function, since solving is the expensive bit then I changed the code use another function for fitting. $C(t)=\sum_{k}(a_{k}+i d_{k})e^{-b_{k} t}e^{i c_{k} t}$. The downside is that since this function has 4 parameters, it required changing other functions as well, luckily only functions starting with _, hopefully this won't delay the PR too much.

So, even though we are not using any quotes in our code, this internally maps to the string approach ?; I am trying to understand how to do what I want using callbacks instead, I could use a bit of help.; This is what the original code I shared here reads:. ```; # list of variational parameters ""a[]""; a=[]; for i in range(numite):; a.append(0.01*i). # define energy function by using variational parameters; def energy(a):; psi = initial_H.eigenstates(sparse=False)[1][0]; t = np.linspace(0, 1, timesteps+1); for i in range(numite):; 	H=[[initial_H,1-a[i]*t],[final_H,a[i]*t]]; 	result= qt.mesolve(H, psi, t, [], []); 	psi=result.states[timesteps].

I am a bit unclear whether or not ""args"" is a list or a dictionary and how I can access it inside my callbacks.

Or do you have a link to an example, maybe ?; I am just targeting the innermost portion of the code, here:. ```; mesolve_args = ... # a dictionary ? a list?

Availability,"Thanks both @jakelishman and @hodgestar for your comments! I agree that I may be depending too much on the classes in `qutip.tests.core.data` to do the testing both in qutip-tensorflow and qutip-tensornetwork. I myself was worried of ""who is going to tests the tests"" if this trend continued with other packages. Reusing the `qutip.tests.core.data`'s code though helps to speed things up in the development process and also allows QuTiP to strictly define what each specialisation is meant to do. . As you mentioned above, I think it would be best to create a `qutip.core.data.testing` module where all the classes for testing are implemented. Then these classes could be tested to ensure that the proper tests are created and these classes ca be used by both QuTiP and downstream packages. I do not have time for this now but I will come to this later, so lets keep this PR open to discuss any ideas!. ----. > the data layer tests should really discover the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR). I am not sure about this one. Automatic discovery of tests for specialisations seems to lead to very restricted flexibility in how tests are parametrized. For instance, I needed to change the `rtol` to accommodate the tests for the complex64 data layer in qutip-tensorflow and I am not sure how this could be added automatically. . Also, as @hodgestar mentioned today, you probably want to be explicit on adding tests so that you are confident that those tests are running. Otherwise you need to constantly check the log to ensure the proper tests are running. . Another thing is that by being explicit on what is tested, you could assert if the tested specialisation has not been registered (which actually happened to both qutip-cupy and qutip-tensorflow before: specialisations where being tested but, surprisingly, they were not registered).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356:770,down,downstream,770,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356,1,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Thanks for looking deeply into it. It's good to know the cause. We shouldn't remove support for SciPy 1.4 unless we _absolutely_ have to. Most users won't use matrices that large so won't be affected, and SciPy 1.5 is only a year old which is too recent to be a requirement in an academic setting. We should maintain at least a 2-year dependency window (like NumPy). Any constraints we make on allowable versions affect any packages downstream of us as well, so we want to try and stay as permissive as possible, as long as there's not new features that we absolutely must have. We already have mechanisms for working around an unstable `eigh` implementation because of problems with mac OpenBLAS `zheevr` in some cases, so we can add in this additional test when setting `eigh_unsafe` in our initialisation. The principle is that we decay to using the general-purpose `eig`, and include a specific orthonormalisation step to stabilise the eigensystem afterwards. This code is already in `qutip/sparse.py`, so it shouldn't be too hard to add an extra condition in `qutip/__init__.py`. Could you also test if the issue is also confined to MKL, or if it persists in OpenBLAS with SciPy 1.4 as well? We lose precision when swapping down to `eig` in place of `eigh`, so it's good to confine the switch to the minimum known-bad set.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109:433,down,downstream,433,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109,2,['down'],"['down', 'downstream']"
Availability,"Thanks for reporting this - it's an important bug that's snuck in. Right now, there's a few errors in your code that you can fix to get on your way again, but we need to fix the error on our side. You're using `sigmap()` which is the Pauli excitation operator and is only defined for a Hilbert space with dimension 2. You actually are working with a Hilbert space of dimension `nmax * nmax` (a tensor-product space), so your `e_ops` argument to `sesolve` is wrong - it's difficult to know exactly what you meant here. `destroy(2)` is equivalent to `sigmap()`, so it's possible you intended to have `e_ops` be `[qutip.tensor(a1, a2)]`?. ---. Maintainers: The error is actually a segfault, because QuTiP 4.5 (probably 4.4 too) does not do sufficient error checking on`e_ops` arguments - probably they're missing in the conversion to `CQobjEvo`. When the expectation is called, it has already sidestepped `Qobj`'s dimensions check and there is no matrix size check, so it simply segfaults on OOB access. The fix for the 4.x branch is to have a very loud Python-space error due to mismatched `Qobj` dimensions on entry to the solvers, or insert a size check within `CQobjEvo`. High priority: there's no reason we should be segfaulting here. Partially fixed in the 5.x branch; all matrix multiplications that take place in C-space have a size check and throw a Python exception, however the solvers still sidestep the `Qobj` dimension check so a tensor-product-space mismatch will not be detected.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492:92,error,errors,92,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492,5,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Availability,"Thanks very much @Ericgig for preparing this!. I feel like it will be quite confusing if gates like `cnot` have different signatures than the ones in qutip-qip. Moreover, many of those gates/transformations are not only relevant to `qip`, but also used in other applications, so maybe we should keep more of them in the main qutip. One of the reasons that we want to include those gates into `qutip.operators` is because a few other downstream packages (e.g. `krylovsolver` that is now merged into qutip, and `qutip-tensornetwork` also uses Hadamard transform) also use them for testing (only) purposes. Having them in the main qutip may save them from depending on qutip-qip. I guess it would be better if we either; - Remove all qip and only define a few `_cnot`, `_swap` as private functions for testing inside the main qutip. And ask whoever else wants to use some gates to install `qutip-qip`. This may result in e.g. `qutip-tensornetwork` depending on `qutip-qip or having to implement a copy of some gates. or; - Include some more commonly used gates like `rx`, `ry` (they are unitaries generated by the Paulis and directly relevant to quantum control) `iswap` etc and keep them identical to the ones in qutip-qip, so that those who just want some gates for testing does not have to download the full qutip-qip. If the problem is the `qutip.qip.expand_operator`. I would argue that we can even include it into the main qutip. It is `tensor` + `permutation` and works not just for qubit systems, but also for other composite Hilbert spaces (provided a `dims`). It is quite handy not just for `qip`, but also for control and probably some other applications.

Availability,"Thanks victor!  My main worry as it stands is that, as I mentioned in the previous issue, this fix, on its own, introduces an unwanted additional error for the case with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, as then that time dependence essentially gets shifted twice, once by the H_shifted change, and once again by adding tlist[idx] to tau_list. ; This case of a time-dependent H could do with a test as well I guess. . This can be easily remedied by completely omitting the old method of shifting the time-dependence (e.g., using H and c_ops instead of H_shifted and c_ops_shifted in the call to mesolve(), for example).    But I am a little concerned that the the old method of shifting the time-dependence in H_shifted and C_ops_shifted was there for a reason.  @Ericgig any thoughts?.

Availability,"The `Qcircuit.tex` PR was unfortunately many many years ago, long before I made my first commit to QuTiP (according to `git log` it was by Anubhav Vardhan in 2014), so the damage is already done. It was on my mind because there was a PR about updating the version of the code in it (#1187). Nonetheless, we definitely should remove it. @BoxiLi Boxi: `Qcircuit.tex` is a concern for `qutip-qip` more than the main library from 5.0 onwards - it's currently in `qip/circuit_latex.py`, which we'll have removed, but you've gained. It might be most appropriate to handle this the same way Qiskit does - generate code which does `\usepackage{qcircuit}`, and leave it up to the user to have a properly-provisioned LaTeX environment. I note that `qcircuit` is included in MikTeX and TexLive since at least 2018 (but not sure when exactly it was added). > Yeah putting years I think is the correct thing. Didn't know that at the time. Ah, that's good to know, thanks. I'm trying to learn more about licensing - I'm trying to get it sorted now into the right form, but it's a really complicated field.

That's also why we might want to remove the general licence text from each file - it's already redundant, but it'll be much harder to update if we have it scattered everywhere (automation would run the risk of us messing up and changing any external code's licence as well, I think, which would be wrong). > Look forward to talking to you in July!.

Availability,"The code below is a (hopefully) minimum working example that demonstrates the strange behavior of the stochastic solver. I'm simulating a single trajectory using `general_stochastic` and plotting the returned expectation values along with expectation values calculated from the states. There is also a theoretical solution for the variances of X and Y, which are deterministic despite the stochastic evolution. The manually calculated expectations match the theory perfectly which means the states are correct. The returned ones accumulate errors and obviously shouldn't be used.

The argument from Liouvillian doesn't work here - even before the new data layer, `liouvillian` never called the `tidyup` code because it accessed the `Qobj.data` field directly, rather than used `Qobj`. Since it then goes into `CQobjEvo` in most of the solvers, which also don't touch the `tidyup` code, it doesn't get called. I don't think there's any safe way to know if small values should actually be zero, or if they're just small values. It makes sense that we want to maintain as much sparsity as possible when values are truly zero, but I think having the QuTiP default be to attempt to tidy up after every addition, multiplication and matrix multiplication is quite unsafe, and for people who aren't doing very very sparse calculations, it's actually a slow down.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384:1141,down,down,1141,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"There are two reasons I did not go with `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`:; - This returns False when `other` is a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor which makes `__mul__` significantly less flexible.; - If we accept objects that are not instances of `numbers.Number`, we will still have to use `complex(other)`. This is necessary to infer if the output is hermitian or unitary. Hence, instead of doing a set of `isinstance` checks and `shape` checks for NumPy TensorFlow or any other future library we may want to be somewhat compatible with, we just check whether other it can be casted to `complex`. If it can, `mul` makes sense and we let the specialisation do whatever they ""want"" (they could always just do complex(value) in any case). I must admit that the try except with complex also seems not ideal to me. But I could not find a better implementation that fitted the requirements. I mean, we do use this same code pattern at some other points in the code (in `__matmul__` we raise not implemented if `other` can not be casted to Qobj and we catch this with a try) but what worries me is: what happens if `complex(other)` raises TypeError not because we do not know how to do the cast but because the user made a mistake in the code? An example of this could be:; ```python; arrray = np.array([1,2]) # length 2 array; qobj*array; ```; This will return `TypeError` but with a different message if we catch it in the `complex(other)` try execpt. ; - _With_ a try execpt that returns NotImplemented (current implementation) the error message is:` TypeError: operand 'Qobj' does not support ufuncs (__array_ufunc__=None)`; - Wehreas _without_ the try expect (not returnt NotImplemented if `complex(other)` fails), the error message is: `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`, which could be a useful error message.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-885550798:1534,error,error,1534,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-885550798,3,['error'],['error']

The thin wrappers around `add_csr` and `add_dense` (and `add_csr_dense_dense`, etc, if they exist), only need to be done when they're passed to the dispatcher - the functions themselves should remain as they are, so they can conveniently be called with C semantics without needing to cast up to a Python object and back down again. `data.add(left, right, scale)` done at arbitrary precision with no tidying up should be identical to `data.add(left, data.mul(right, scale))` (the operation is called ""fused multiply-add""), so yeah, `add` should agree with `mul`.

Availability,"This all seems incredibly complicated. How about all specialisations stored in the dispatcher take `object` as the scalar type, and throw a TypeError if they can't handle it. `Qobj.__mul__` just does a `try/except`, and returns `NotImplemented` if it catches a TypeError. If it doesn't catch a type error, it calls a separate function, something like; ```python; @functools.singledispatch; def _scalar_properties(x):; return {; # if the matrix was Hermitian, is the output Hermitian (True), or not known (False); 'preserves_hermicity': bool,; # regardless of the input matrix, is the output Hermitian (True), or not known (False); # (i.e. was the scalar zero-like).; 'forces_hermicity': bool,; # if the matrix was unitary, is it still unitary (True), or not known (False); 'preserves_unitarity': Optional[bool],; }; ```; Then just register types with the functools dispatcher?. So then `Qobj.__mul__` looks like:; ```python; def __mul__(self, other):; if isinstance(other, (Qobj, QobjEvo)):; return self.__matmul__(other); try:; out = _data.mul(self.data, other); except TypeError:; return NotImplemented; properties = _scalar_properties(other); isherm = properties['forces_hermicity'] or (self.isherm and properties['preserves_hermicity'] or None); isunitary = self.isunitary and properties['preserves_unitarity'] or None; return Qobj(; out, copy=False, dims=self.dims, isherm=isherm, isunitary=isunitary,; ); ```; (I've probably not got the property truthiness checking exactly right, but that's the principle.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889018969:299,error,error,299,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889018969,1,['error'],['error']

This is actually _more_ useful in that case - it's far clearer that that code is under different licence conditions. That said, I'm really not certain about accepting #1405 in its current form. It's not using the data-layer correctly at all, and if we were to include it, we'd really want to do something like that in a more structured way in core QuTiP. Really it should be a properly dispatched implementation of `einsum`, but I think this should come in as part of a much larger discussion on how to handle tensor networks completely; to have it be nice and ergonomic in all cases, I think this will come in at the same time or after the introduction of new dimensions objects. I'm also very wary of introducing code to QuTiP which is licensed by a different holder. I can only imagine that that will really give us problems down the line - how long would NASA own the copyright on that code, for example? Could we modify it?

Availability,"This is an artifact of `auto_tidyup`; the object in the picture is zero everywhere except the diagonal, whose values are of the order 1e-7. The first step of calculating the trace norm is to do `op @ op.dag()`, which you can see will make all the diagonal entries of order 1e-14. This is below the default tolerance for `auto_tidyup`, so the resulting sparse matrix gets contracted to zero. This happens within `Qobj.norm`, so cannot be intercepted by the user. Can be worked around by temporarily setting `qutip.settings.auto_tidyup = False`, but that's just a work-around.

Availability,"This issue has a two-fold interest: decreasing test time in general and expand the platforms through which QuTiP is available. . What is the reason it takes so long on Nix? QuTiP, in the [latest PR](https://travis-ci.org/qutip/qutip/builds/628865624?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification), takes on average 20 minutes to run its tests on a given platform. Much of this I think is due to the Cython configurations, indeed the no-cython option takes only 13 minutes. My first suggestion would be to try without Cython if things speed up, from those requirements (@Ericgig set that up and I am not knowledgeable about it). . From your PR on `nixpkgs` do you build on Travis CI or a similar cloud? If you could give a list of time taken by the different tests that would help. . The idea of a subset of tests is interesting (essential tests vs. thorough tests), in general; for example thorough tests could be done only in production and a lighter version could be called with `qutip.testing.run()`. Although, in specific, it is not clear to me how to triage which tests to skip.

Availability,"To me this is a question of what guarantees our primary type makes, so it's quite a big decision to be taken. I'm not sure I agree that implementing `__array_wrap__` is a good idea - `Qobj` does not support ufunc semantics, and implementing that implies that we're a similar class to `ndarray`, which I don't think we are. I don't think `np.sin(qobj)` should return `ndarray` _or_ `Qobj`; I think it should be a TypeError. To me, we should be rather conservative about adding features like that when there's little tangible benefit - when there's a slightly more explicit alternative syntax, it's better to fail-safe than add potential ""gotchas"". The fact that elementwise operations are not part of the algebra of `Qobj` should be enough of a reason to cause you to have to explicitly ask for it, otherwise it tacitly _becomes_ part of the algebra. For your point three, if that's the case, I'd argue you're doing something wrong: are you constructing the `Qobj` before you've finalised your data? Shouldn't it be; ```python; incomplete_data = np.array([[theta, 0, 0], ...]); return Qobj(np.sin(incomplete_data)); ```; not; ```python; return np.sin(Qobj(incomplete_data)); ```. As a compromise, we could ensure that all our data-layer types (`CSR`, `Dense`, whatever else) will support ufuncs with ndarray syntax; then you could do `Qobj(np.sin(qobj.data))` to be explicitly elementwise if you really wanted, rather than absolutely requiring you to produce a full dense matrix. I'm still not sure I see the use case there, though. I'm in favour of removing `np.array([qobj1, qobj2, ...], dtype=object)` usage inside QuTiP no matter which way we come down on this, though. As far as I recall from seeing it, there no reason to use `ndarray` over a regular Python list in any of our internal use, and it's rarely (if ever) actually returned out of a QuTiP function. Given it might cause subtle differences between different numpy versions, probably best to avoid it.

Availability,"We can't implement `__hash__` for `Qobj`, sorry - it's just not possible while following the [Python data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__). The two principle points that a hash function must follow from there are; 1. objects which compare equal with `__eq__` have the same hash; 2. the hash of an object cannot change after instantiation (no mutable types). Unfortunately we fail on both points. `Qobj.__eq__` is a rounding match, because it gives a total `True` or `False` based on a floating point tolerance, not on exact equality. I'm not aware of any hash function which can handle this. Second, the `data` attribute of a `Qobj` is mutable in-place, and so hashing based on the data in the object is not valid. This is the same reason that `list` and `np.ndarray` are also not hashable types.

It is located in `qutip/qutip/qip` in your local python package installation folder. If you can't find it then you can go for a fresh install with this file. - Remove your current qutip version with a `pip uninstall qutip`; - Download the latest qutip version from the [website](qutip.org) and replace the `circuit.py` file in `qutip/qip` folder with the one from here.; - Reinstall qutip by running `python setup.py install` from your qutip folder.

Availability,"What's wrong with just using a loop? Adding the `combine` statement is already extra work for you, and using the solver in a loop will be much clearer about what's going on. The `Qobj` object container is not meant to a vector of objects itself - use a list for that, or a numpy array if you're only going to do simple mathematical operations that you want broadcasting for (numpy will broadcast `*`, `/`, `+`, `-` and `**` correctly). The calculational complexity of the solver isn't helped by knowing you're going to do it a few times, but there are some setup costs that QuTiP already gives you the tools to alleviate. `mesolve` constructs a Liouvillian out the Hamiltonian and collapse operators; if you want to reuse the result of this, you should use `qutip.liouvillian` and `qutip.QobjEvo`, and use the `compile` method of the latter. You can pass the result of this directly as the `H` parameter of `mesolve` and it'll skip all the setup. There is some work going on about making a class-based interface to the solvers, which allows easier use of the tools to reduce setup time, but those likely won't be released for some time yet. In the meantime, just use a loop here. There will not be a notable slow down (unlike numpy maths operations) because the Python iteration over elements takes a negligible amount of time compared to single numerical intergration. As a side note, in this particular case you're doing unitary dynamics with state vectors, so this call to `mesolve` is actually translated into one to `sesolve`, which does not need to construct the Liouvillian.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660459774:1213,down,down,1213,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660459774,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Whether it is an issue likely depends on you school of thought. The error comes from the finite accuracy of the solvers. By default, the solutions are found using a method that is accurate 12-order in the step size and looks for absolute and relative errors at the 1e-8 and 1e-6 levels, respectively. If you evolve for long enough then inevitably there is going to be some error, and you will not get perfectly Hermitian matrices. One can accept this, and possibly lower the tolerance levels for more accuracy, or you can take 0.5*(A+A.dag()) to force the Hermicity. What method you use likely depends on your question and taste.

Availability,"Yeah, definitely there's no point running tests that aren't really testing the package properly. I would hope that if we're much more aggressive about converting time-dependent lists into QobjEvo objects inside `mesolve`, `mcsolve` and `sesolve` (or the class-based versions of them), we could significantly reduce the amount of testing that needs to be done with them. Most of the tests of time-dependent formats would then occur in the QobjEvo tests. We could still test all the configurations of the solvers without too heavy a time penalty. If we only use a small number of different time-dependent operators, we can compile them all only once, and have `pytest` manage the resources through shared fixtures. That would really cut down the run times, especially for the current ""slow"" tests. Another avenue for cutting down run time is if we could merge say the MKL and OpenMP tests into one Travis job - the setup time for one job is about 2.5 minutes, and that's before any tests have run at all. I would hazard a guess that having MKL but not OpenMP is a pretty rare case (maybe more common on high-performance clusters where people submit single-cpu jobs?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182:735,down,down,735,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182,2,['down'],['down']

Hopefully `qutip.mesolve` should be a near drop-in replacement for you (`c_ops_list` is now called `c_ops`, but other than that you're fine), and it may well be a lot faster as well. @Ericgig, @ajgpitch: shall we commit to maintaining `essolve` and/or the `eseries` class, or issue a deprecation warning as soon as possible?

Availability,"Yeah, so this bug is fixed in QuTiP 4.5.3 and above. You can also fix it by downgrading Numpy to 1.19 or below (in 1.20 they changed how they handle object arrays, which broke us and a few other packages). That's strange that Conda won't let you upgrade beyond 4.5.2; there's no constraint on our conda package which should prevent it. Do you have any other packages installed that depend on QuTiP?

I'm still not a fan of `Qobj.__array__`, but happy enough to go with it since it seems everyone else likes it (we should also reinstate it in `dev.major`). We can set `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = Qobj.__array_function__ = None` to disable ufuncs and other numpy functions unconditionally. It's unlikely this will annoy anyone, since we've not had a complaint that ufuncs on `Qobj` does something super weird since `Qobj.__array__` was implemented. We can leave it unless Simon wants to make some more of the case for allowing ufuncs on `Qobj`, or happy to go with this? (tag @hodgestar.).

Availability,"Yeah, that's good. There are plenty of cases (like in the tests) where we want to change something like `ntraj` on-the-fly within the same script. Even just in regular REPL work, I mess around with tolerances and things like that, and it's much much easier to be able to do that case-by-case, rather than having to set global state, which often ends up with boilerplate when you're trying to be safe - you can't do quick checks as one-liners, and you have to use `try/finally` if you only want to temporarily set it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1297#issuecomment-651144540:198,toler,tolerances,198,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1297#issuecomment-651144540,1,['toler'],['tolerances']
Availability,"Yeah, this feels like a bug in `propagator` - I bet at some point we do `qeye(L.shape[0])` instead of `qeye(L.dims[0])`. There's sometimes quite a bit of that in older code - it used to slip through because we weren't super strict about dimension handling, so in certain cases (like this one), we'd accept bad dimensions. I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix.

Availability,"Yeah, this is a ""true"" merge of the qutip-doc repository with this one.

Availability,"Yeah, this is just one of those silly things caused by ImageMagick choosing a _very_ generic name and then getting burned (hence the swap to `magick`...). Probably the best thing to do is to try and run `convert` once at discovery and to see what happens. If you run `convert -version` on an IM6 install, does it output a string that looks like; > Version: ImageMagick 6.blahblahblah; or something similar?. If so, try this patch: [check_convert.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4397692/check_convert.txt). It rearranged the functions a little for a more logical order (I'll rebase the PR before merge), but the main change is that it now tests the output of `convert -version` to see if it contains the substring `imagemagick` (case insensitive). The reason to do this now is because if we allowed the error to propagate later, we'd have to check it every time and it would mean we'd have to pass through the ""special cases"" more frequently, and it would make the core logic more complex.

Availability,"You still wouldn't be able to put `Qobj` into numpy arrays except by doing something like; ```python; qobjs = np.empty(3, dtype=object); qobjs[:] = [qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2)]; ```; but probably that's not _too_ much of a big deal. Leaving QuTiP as it is right now would require that anyway. My main problem is actually just with allowing ufuncs and other numpy interfaces to act directly on `Qobj` without an explicit conversion step, because it promotes the idea that it's ok to act elementwise on a `Qobj`. I don't think we should allow ufuncs at all - `Qobj` is not meant to be like an `ndarray` and ufunc semantics don't make sense. We can set `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = None` and `Qobj.__array_function__ = None` to disable numpy functions acting on `Qobj` directly. Example with this in place:; ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> import numpy as np; >>> np.array(qutip.qeye(2)); array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],; [0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]]); >>> np.array([qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2)]) # Not ideal, but not our fault.; array([[[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],; [0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]],.

Doing this leaves us susceptible to problems interacting with other libraries that implement this, though, beacuse whichever class has the highest `__array_priority__` gets to dictate what makes sense. Unless there's a really clear _need_ for this, I don't think it's a good idea.

Availability,"_**edit to put the positivity up top!**_: This is a very exciting prospect to me, and I'm always happy when other libraries want to interact with QuTiP! In the interests of inciting more discussion, I've got thrown in some more discussion points below - I'm 100% sure they're all solvable, but it also seems like there isn't one way that's unambiguously correct to do them, so they're worth discussing. ---. In principle I'm happy to implement this, though I don't really agree with your assertion that `othertype.toqobj()` is bad style! It might be so in Julia, but Python doesn't have all the same multiple-dispatch niceties that Julia has, so at the end of the day, we have to add in a method with a ""magic"" name somewhere, and it all just comes down to choosing the name of the method. The downside to having a magic name is that it means we have to eschew proper namespacing; what if another library one day wants to call their interface the same thing? Then it's completely impossible for a downstream library to interoperate with both. Having conversions be a non-special method of the downstream class, and leaving our constructor unaware of them alleviates that issue. Numpy can get away with squatting the `__array__` name because they're _huge_, but I would argue that if we do it, we could actually _harm_ the quantum software ecosystem in the long-run - what happens when a package better than QuTiP comes along that wants to call its objects `Qobj` as well? Let's face it - it's a pretty straightforward name!. All that said, I am very aware that not everyone agrees with me on this, and I _am_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no ot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:749,down,down,749,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,3,['down'],"['down', 'downside', 'downstream']"

Availability,"`[]` is a list while 'identity' is function, so they will invoke two different type of time-dependent functions (list-string or list-function type or function callback type, respectively). `rhs_reuse` only applies to the list-string type, so it should only affect the first type of call to `mesolve`. It might be that we have a bug in handing of empty lists as first argument to mesolve, I will look into that. Regarding `rhs_reuse` it can behave a bit differently in a script and the notebook because a notebook is one long-running python process, so the state of `rhs_reuse` might be retained from one call to `mesolve` to another, while a script would get reset between successive calls (runs of the script). I guess this is the reason for the backtrace error you show. Note that you cannot use `rhs_reuse` with successive calls to `mesolve` if you change the function signature. If this is not the case, then it would be useful with a small minimum example (script or notebook) that reproduces the error. ps.. In your second use-case you qouted `mesolve(identity, ..)`. In this case I would rather use `mesolve(identity(), ..)`, so that the first argument is a `Qobj` instance rather than the function that returns one.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/123#issuecomment-42158885:757,error,error,757,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/123#issuecomment-42158885,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"`auto-tidyup` exist to remove 0s stored in sparse matrices. `auto-tidyup` is quite messy, rounding all values under 1e-12 to 0 per default after each matrix operation can only cause problems. . As for the benchmark, why ask for dense operations to add an extra step to increase their outputs error to the same level as sparse operations so their benchmark do not look to good in comparisons. I think it is fair that the sparse operation's timing include the time needed to manage it's structure. . For auto-differentiation, if operations included are done with `Qobj`, it would have to differentiate tidy-up steps after each operation. But since the tidy-up operation does not have a clean derivative (`out[out < 1e-12] = 0`) it will make the auto-differentiation very inefficient.

I don't know enough of the history behind numpy current api, but I see your point. however I'd like to reiterate that this is not what I am proposing. ; I think there is considerable difference between supporting arbitrary operations `new_obj = Qobj + netket_operator*5` (though if you are going to export dispatch hooks in `5.0`, this would be possible in a consistent way, I think) and `qutip.mesolve(netket_operator, ...)`. ; In the first, I do agree with your point that the nature python's `__add__/__radd__` is not commutative, leading to surprising behavior. From my point of view, no package really owns `+` so any conversion would be implicit.; But `qutip.groundstate(netket_operator)` is in itself an explicit cast. I am explicitly asking to qutip `please give me the ground state of this object`. I do expect to get a Qobj out, and qutip to make an effort converting this object to whatever format he internally wants to work with. Same goes with time evolution. . > For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining __qutip_qobj__, instead we expose an entry-point qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None), and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. I do prefer such an approach. I just did not think that was an option in QuTiP.; In fact we have redesigned NetKet to allow for something similar using multiple dispatch. (I’m not familiar with Tensorflow either.). I do agree with all your points, especially the first.

Availability,"ck in __init__ . Again, I think that your observation is right. I thought about it only after I submitted the post above. The way numpy does it is that `__array__(self, dtype)` takes only one argument, but I think we can do better and better respect the API set by qutip. ; That is why I was suggesting that `object.__qutip_qobj__` should not return a Qobj directly, but rather the data needed by QuTiP to construct a Qobj, and qutip should be free to re-organize it afterwards as he likes. . > 3 - we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve Qobj.__init__ between major versions. You could for example require that `__qutip_qobj__(self, version, *kwargs)` takes in a version of the API? I believe that is what numpy does in `__array_interface__`. And it's on implementers of the interface the burden of checking the api version and throwing an error if it's not supported. Or the inverse, where implementers return whatever data they return and a version of the API they are using, and qutip can throw an error if that is an older version. The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip. I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. -- ; About keyword handling: copy-pasting the list of kwargs of `Qobj`...; ```python; inpt : array_like = Data for vector/matrix representation of the quantum object.; dims : list = Dimensions of object used for tensor products.; shape : list = Shape of underlying data structure (matrix shape).; copy : bool = Flag specifying whether Qobj should get a copy of the input data, or use the original.; fast : bool = Flag for fast qobj creation when running od",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810:1409,error,error,1409,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"e input to the `einsum`-like function, then calls the `Dispatcher` with this information. I think this form would likely be preferable for several reasons:; 1. it will allow arbitrary mixing of different data types (`CSR` complete space and `Dense` operator, or both `CSR`, or whatever), with the allowed conversions respecting the global dispatcher rules, not having this function use a different, special configuration; 2. it will mean that the function can also be implemented by plug-in data types (TF/CuPy/etc), installed separately to QuTiP; 3. it will be more general, and easier to maintain; the current `subsystem_apply`, `partial_transpose`, `ptrace`, `tensor_contract` and this can all become special cases of this backing `einsum`-like routine.; 4. after we've implemented new dimensions objects, we'll be able to use a more standardised description of how to refer to individual subspaces of a Hilbert space, which will provide a more consistent UX across the library. This is particularly important if we want this to work well with superoperators. Really, thank you very much for making the PR - I really am excited to see people with an interest in the new data layer! I'm sorry that I took quite so long to respond properly to it, and that when I have, I've ended up being somewhat against the implementaton as it is. I would be really interested in pursuing this, likely after the initial release of 5.0, but right now I think we might need to get our ducks in a row about licensing primarily, and then about how we're going to handle tensor networks in general. In order to prevent headaches down the line (and again, very very sorry), would it be ok if we leave this unmerged, and don't attempt to modify it in any way? I don't want to get into a situation where we decide we can't accept non-QuTiP-licenced code, and we want to use/build on your code or implement something similar, but our hands are tied because anything we do will involve our knowledge of IP we don't control.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566:4580,down,down,4580,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"e just dump out some information. ## Things you should know if you've not worked with segfaults before. - `Abort trap 6`, `Segmentation fault` and a few other points can all be from the same cause; - Segmentation faults are typically caused by reading or writing to memory that isn't owned by our process. These often occur by reading/writing too much data to an allocated pointer, or trying to read/write a memory location where the location was read from uninitialised memory.; - Segfaults will not always reliably occur. It's _very_ difficult to prove that swapping tools ""fixes"" a segfault; it can often just move around enough allocations to mask the problem, not fix it.; - Python stack traces are likely to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, wh",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807:1378,mask,mask,1378,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807,1,['mask'],['mask']

Availability,"ecomment-859717563 on the requirements: beyond yielding the propagated states, we'll also have to modify the controls, i.e. the time-dependencies for QuTiP's nested-list format. Within the `krotov` package, these would always be numpy arrays. As an explanation, see [the figure for Krotov's update scheme](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/_images/krotovscheme.svg) from [the documentation](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/07_krotovs_method.html#time-discretization). The single-step-`mesolve` would be for the ""(2) forward-propagation with updated control"" in the bottom of the diagram: After each propagation time step, we calculate a new control value based on the current propagated state and other information (the ∂H/∂ϵ and stored backward-propagated states χ). The new control value is then used for the next time step. I'd also add that `mesolve` ideally should be ""thread-safe"" in the sense that we may have multiple `mesolve` run in parallel (index k in the diagram, where all the different k contribute to the update of the control values at the next time step), within whatever parallelization framework Python makes available. I vaguely remember looking at some Runge-Kutta implementations within scipy where this was a problem. I noted this in the docstring of krotov's [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/master/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162), which was an attempt to adapt some of `mesolve`'s inner workings to Krotov's needs. It turned out the overhead was still too large for this work very well, cf. the large runtime of the [corresponding example](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/06_example_3states.html). To get very technical, Krotov's requirements are laid out in the documentation of the [`Propagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/master/src/krotov/propagators.py#L125) abstract base class, [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/master/src/krotov/propagat",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859754215:2952,avail,available,2952,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859754215,1,['avail'],['available']

The reason numpy does this now is because (my understanding is that) defining `__array__` was meant to be a much stronger guarantee than just ""it's convenient to let `np.array` know about this object"". It was meant to be an indication that your class can be safely coerced into `ndarray` (and potentially coerced back afterwards), and that mathematical operations will satisfy the normal ufunc broadcasting rules, which isn't true of `Qobj`. That means that arrays of things implementing `__array__` should be safely representable as `ndarray`, which clearly isn't true for us. Similarly, ever since `Qobj.__array__` was first defined you could use Numpy ufuncs on `Qobj`, which would get implicitly converted to `ndarray` and then return complete nonsense, rather than throwing an error like ""what you're doing is silly"":; ```python; >>> np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1)); array([[0. ],; [0.84147098]]); ```; (imo that should really be a `TypeError` if done without an explicit conversion into Numpy semantics). There is a way around that latter point in modern Numpy - defining `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = Qobj.__array_function__ = None` - but it does raise the question of whether we _should_ define `Qobj.__array__`; we have no intention of implying that `Qobj` satisfies the general Numpy ufunc interface, and it isn't any sort of `ndarray`-like type, because it satisfies matrix semantics, not array semantics. That's the reason `scipy.sparse` types don't implement `__array__`. There always was a sanctioned method for converting `Qobj` to `ndarray` - `Qobj.full()`, similar to `scipy`'s `spmatrix.toarray()` - so `Qobj.__array__` was never a _necessity_, just a convenience in some workflows.

Availability,"ed features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can be turned on at the same time.; - Features to perform error mitigation techniques in QuTiP, such as zero-error extrapolation.; - APIs to allow import quantum circuits from other software packages or commonly used language e.g. through quantum assembly language (qasm); ----------------------------------------------------------------.

Availability,"ee to re-organize it afterwards as he likes. . > 3 - we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve Qobj.__init__ between major versions. You could for example require that `__qutip_qobj__(self, version, *kwargs)` takes in a version of the API? I believe that is what numpy does in `__array_interface__`. And it's on implementers of the interface the burden of checking the api version and throwing an error if it's not supported. Or the inverse, where implementers return whatever data they return and a version of the API they are using, and qutip can throw an error if that is an older version. The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip. I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. -- ; About keyword handling: copy-pasting the list of kwargs of `Qobj`...; ```python; inpt : array_like = Data for vector/matrix representation of the quantum object.; dims : list = Dimensions of object used for tensor products.; shape : list = Shape of underlying data structure (matrix shape).; copy : bool = Flag specifying whether Qobj should get a copy of the input data, or use the original.; fast : bool = Flag for fast qobj creation when running ode solvers.; ```. For the case of the usage that netket would have, our objects already define the Hilbert space they are acting on (so `dims` and `shape`). `copy` doesn't really make sense for us, because we would be building the representation . The way I see it, `Qobj(other_pkg_obj,**kwargs)` should behave like `Qobj(qutip_obj, **kwargs)`, so `__qutip_qobj__` should return the matrix data, shape and dims if possible, and qutip will handle i",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810:1767,error,error,1767,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810,3,"['down', 'error', 'fault']","['downstream', 'error', 'fault']"

Availability,"en module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better and easier to read as time went on. (The later files haven't been converted yet.) The main things are to always be thinking about readability both of the code and the error messages that are coming out, and making sure that your tests are really testing that your functions have your behaviour you want them to have. Another thing we really don't have enough of in QuTiP yet is tests for ""negative"" behaviour, i.e. testing that functions _fail_ when they're passed incorrect inputs - consequently, quite a lot of QuTiP actually will just silently do the wrong thing if it's passed nonsense.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706:2376,error,error,2376,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"erlib` isn't compatible with QuTiP next, whereas `Qobj(otherlib.obj)` failing would (rightly) be taken as QuTiP being at fault, which stymies our development a little because we're forced to be more conservative than we otherwise would be with our constructor. This is going to be a particular problem with handling `dims`, since we're talking about completely changing the structure for how that's managed internally to help us in other parts of our library.; 4. what will happen with all the other keyword arguments passed to the `Qobj` constructor? We have probably three choices:; - pass all keywords on (which is a big problem in conjunction with the point above);; - pass none of them on, call `__qutip_qobj__` within `Qobj.__new__`, and then pass through `Qobj.__init__` like normal, but now with our new `Qobj` instance as the argument. This would have a slightly nontrivial interaction with the `copy` keyword, I imagine, but not an unsolvable one.; - error if you pass something that defines `__qutip_qobj__` in addition to keywords. This isn't ideal because it gives `Qobj` special treatment - additional kwargs can override `Qobj` settings if they're compatible. ---. Just in the interest of completeness, let me also just bring up some of the sweeping changes we'll bringing in in QuTiP 5.0 as well, which massively overhaul how `Qobj` is constructed, and how its data is stored. These aren't _directly_ applicable to the current discussion, but they're worth keeping in mind since they're a huge overhaul of how things will be handled, and may have some implications for how implementors of this interface might behave. The new `Qobj` will no longer have the same `fast_csr_matrix` type as its `data` attribute, but instead will have an extensible data type.

Availability,"fine the `__jax_array__` interface). While I think that Qobj is a very qutip-like principle, I see no problems in namespacing. > 2- having the check in __init__ . Again, I think that your observation is right. I thought about it only after I submitted the post above. The way numpy does it is that `__array__(self, dtype)` takes only one argument, but I think we can do better and better respect the API set by qutip. ; That is why I was suggesting that `object.__qutip_qobj__` should not return a Qobj directly, but rather the data needed by QuTiP to construct a Qobj, and qutip should be free to re-organize it afterwards as he likes. . > 3 - we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve Qobj.__init__ between major versions. You could for example require that `__qutip_qobj__(self, version, *kwargs)` takes in a version of the API? I believe that is what numpy does in `__array_interface__`. And it's on implementers of the interface the burden of checking the api version and throwing an error if it's not supported. Or the inverse, where implementers return whatever data they return and a version of the API they are using, and qutip can throw an error if that is an older version. The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip. I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. -- ; About keyword handling: copy-pasting the list of kwargs of `Qobj`...; ```python; inpt : array_like = Data for vector/matrix representation of the quantum object.; dims : list = Dimensions of object used for tensor products.; shape : list = Shape of underlying data structure (matrix shape).; copy : bool ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810:1248,error,error,1248,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"first look it's looking great! I've been working a lot on the stochastic solvers the last few months, but it is still very much under development. The milstein method has been on my todo list for a long time, but I've not gotten around to work on it yet, so your contribution is very timely and most welcome!. I have tried to design the API in the most general way I could think of while still keeping the complexity from growing too much. Defining an SME with its RHS function, D1 and D2 functions has worked for most problems I considered so far, but I'd be happy to discuss further if this could be changed to something more flexible, like a function for calculating rho_{n+1} like you suggest. We hope to have the stochastic solver API ready and mature enough to include in the next qutip release sometime this fall, so it would be good to have these things tested and thoroughly discussed before then. But until the stochastic module is officially in the QuTiP API we still have a lot of freedom to shake things up if necessary. Also, to keep complexity and code duplication down I wanted to follow the pattern. smesolve (choose solver by argument) -> smesolve_generic -> specific method and SDE by rhs, d1, d2 selection. So it would be good if smesolve_mil and smesolve_impl in your code could be combined with smesolve, and if smesolve_implicit and smesolve_milstein could be combined with smesolve_generic, etc. That would reduce a lot of code duplication I think. Of course, if smesolve_generic needs to be changed to accommodate this that would be totally fine with me. It would be great if you could do a pull request of this to the qutip master, then we could discuss details in the PR. You'd need to rebase your branch to the current master tip though, because things already changed a bit since the version you based your additions on. If you have troubles with this or no not know how to do it I could also try to merge your modifications into the qutip master, it's totally up to you.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22011953:1267,down,down,1267,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22011953,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"g - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, when the Python allocators do a little bit of checksumming. I think that in _all_ cases we're seeing the failure come from the garbage collection, but I can't be 100% certain - note that this almost certainly means the failure is somewhere completely different, and it's only _detected_ at garbage collection. Here is the output of a Python 3.8 crash on the `Malloc.py` file with some additional debugging enabled.

Availability,"getting weighed down). We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment _without_ using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features? That's frustrating for users, even though it's not really anybody's fault. Bugging developers is fine when people want to use packages that are still maintained, but I'm sure we've all come up against times in research when you get to trying out a package to do one specific thing that's been abandoned for a while. Again, this certainly isn't an unsolvable problem: having versioning in the interface API is one solution to some of these problems. ---. For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining `__qutip_qobj__`, instead we expose an entry-point `qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None)`, and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. The logic inside the `Qobj` constructor remains approximately the same as what you suggest. I think TensorFlow does something a little more similar to this? (I'm not very familiar with it at all.). Advantages of this over a `__qutip_qobj__` magic method:; - Users aren't limited to what libraries define for them, but can add their own conversions or override library ones if they don't like them. I actually see this as being closer to Julia's dispatch, or Rust's `impl for`.; - It doesn't involve weird namespacing, or anything like that, and doesn't require downstream classes to carry around additional slots. It's less an issue for classes that define `__slots__` since those are frozen methods, but extra methods adds a minor amount vtable weight for most libraries, and makes their class definitions more complex.; - Control between different versions is perhaps a little easier (though a minor point): this _fe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691:5242,down,downstream,5242,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"hat a scalar is (which classes are scalars) and at what level do we define it (who is responsible for returning NotImplemented). Proposed solutions:; 1) Let the _specialisation_ return `NotImplemented` and set `isherm` only when `complex(other)` is possible. This defines what an scalar is at the _specialisation_ level. However:; - It may cause inconsistent behaviour where some operations are allowed for a data layer (`TfTensor` or any other) but not for another one. I would argue that all specialisations should accept the same input, although operations may be handled differently internally (for example, in tensorflow we want to keep the graph state).; - `NotImplemented` only makes sense for some special binary methods (`__add__`, `__lt__`, etc) as Python employs `NotImplemented` to try `other`'s binary method. My concern is that if the dispatcher is used by itself at some points of the code (such as for the solver) returning `NotImplemented` may cause wrong error messages or even unexpected behaviour with future specialisations ( for instance, although it now raises a deprecation warning, `NotImplemented` is considered as `True` when evaluated as a condition). It seems to me that we should avoid having `NotImplemented` in python space (except for arithmetic operations in a class where they are useful and always make sense).; ; 2) Simon suggested to define what a scalar is at the _dispatcher_ level (or something similar to this but correct me if I am wrong). This would require to have a function that casts any defined scalar to a complex scalar. The dispatcher would be responsible to ensure that the correct scalar gets passed appropriately to the specialisation and for returning not implemented if necessary. ; - This solves the inconsistency problem as you could register a ""new"" scalar and define how it gets cast to a python complex scalar with a function (in most of the times, if not always, this will be `complex(other)`). ; - This does _not_ solve having `NotImplem",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889006152:1403,error,error,1403,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889006152,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"her package will ever be called QuTiP. If it's a hidden name, it doesn't matter how ""pretty"" it is.; 2. having the check in `__init__` might not be correct - it feels like it belongs in `__new__` to me. `__init__` modifies an object that's already been created in Python-space, whereas `__new__` allows you to replace the object creation entirely.; 3. we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve `Qobj.__init__` between major versions. If _we_ define a public interface like this rather than having external libraries provide their own implementations, it puts the burden of maintain compatability on us, and takes it off downstream packages, who are able to define version requirements. For example, calling `otherlib.obj.toqobj()` and having it fail with QuTiP next.0 makes it clear that `otherlib` isn't compatible with QuTiP next, whereas `Qobj(otherlib.obj)` failing would (rightly) be taken as QuTiP being at fault, which stymies our development a little because we're forced to be more conservative than we otherwise would be with our constructor. This is going to be a particular problem with handling `dims`, since we're talking about completely changing the structure for how that's managed internally to help us in other parts of our library.; 4. what will happen with all the other keyword arguments passed to the `Qobj` constructor? We have probably three choices:; - pass all keywords on (which is a big problem in conjunction with the point above);; - pass none of them on, call `__qutip_qobj__` within `Qobj.__new__`, and then pass through `Qobj.__init__` like normal, but now with our new `Qobj` instance as the argument. This would have a slightly nontrivial interaction with the `copy` keyword, I imagine, but not an unsolvable one.; - error if you pass something that defines `__qutip_qobj__` in addition to keywords. This isn't ideal because it gives `Qobj` special treatment - additional kwargs can override `Qobj` settings if they're",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:2960,fault,fault,2960,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['fault'],['fault']

The second problem is more serious, and I think it was the same in the my original version. The expectation values returned in `res.expect` are not the same as those computed manually from `res.states`. The values in `res.expect` gradually (but quickly) diverge away from the correct manual values that agree with theory. It is not a small error. (Note that I'm using a single trajectory so no problem of averaging over trajectories.). I would expect complete equality between the two. I would suspect that it's something to do with normalization (?) Passing kwarg `normalize=True` doesn't change anything, nor does the solver. This is how I compute the expectations:; ```; rho_list = [[vector_to_operator(u) for u in res.states[k]] for k in range(ntraj)]. for k in range(ntraj):; for i, rho in enumerate(rho_list[k]):; rho_list[k][i] = rho / rho.tr(); ```.

Availability,"ing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command line. You can do `pytest file.py` to run only those in a specific file, or `pytest -m ""mark logic""` (e.g. `pytest -m ""not slow""`) to hit specifically marked tests. Perhaps most powerfully, and one I use a lot when writing these, you can do `pytest -k ""substring logic""` to run every test (potentially in the specified file(s)) that contains the elements specified in `""substring logic""`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:2461,down,down,2461,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"is a rounding match, because it gives a total `True` or `False` based on a floating point tolerance, not on exact equality. I'm not aware of any hash function which can handle this. Second, the `data` attribute of a `Qobj` is mutable in-place, and so hashing based on the data in the object is not valid. This is the same reason that `list` and `np.ndarray` are also not hashable types. If your cache is just for memoisation over a small number of `Qobj` where you know that floating-point tolerance will never be an issue, you may be able to get away with rolling your own cache decorator which uses linear lookup rather than constant-time. I mean something like; ```python; In [1]: import functools; ...: import qutip; ...:; ...: def linear_cache(f):; ...: cache = []; ...: @functools.wraps(f); ...: def out(*args):; ...: for cached_args, cached_value in cache:; ...: if args == cached_args:; ...: print(""Getting from cache""); ...: return cached_value; ...: print(""Computing new value""); ...: value = f(*args); ...: cache.append((args, value)); ...: return value; ...: return out; ...:; ...: @linear_cache; ...: def negate(x):; ...: return -x; ...:; ...: sx = qutip.sigmax(); ...: sy = qutip.sigmay(); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sy); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sy); Computing new value; Getting from cache; Computing new value; Getting from cache; Getting from cache; ```; This will lead to degraded performance if you need to do it for a large number of possible inputs, but if you have a relatively small number of inputs and your cached function is computationally expensive, this may be a way to achieve what you want. Also note that this is not infallible: the floating-point tolerance used in `__eq__` means that `Qobj` does not satisfy transitive equality (i.e. `a == b and b == c` does not imply `a == c`). The primary consequence of this is that the cache will simply be a little under-zealous, and sometimes it will calculate the value twice for three similar `Qobj`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1321#issuecomment-658078277:1866,degraded,degraded,1866,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1321#issuecomment-658078277,2,"['degraded', 'toler']","['degraded', 'tolerance']"
Availability,"is one), we'd accept bad dimensions. I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix. To do that:; ```python; # initial setup; H = qutip.tensor(...); c_ops = [qutip.tensor(...)]. original_dimensions = H.dims.copy(); new_dimensions = list(H.shape). H.dims = new_dimensions; for c_op in c_ops:; c_op.dims = new_dimensions. outputs = qutip.propagator(H, times, c_ops=c_ops); for op in outputs:; # the ops are superoperators, so have expanded dimensions; op.dims = [original_d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199:1345,error,error,1345,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"ite out a proper design document and get approval of it before we get deep into the implementation. > The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip.; >; > I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. I'm concerned from a user's perspective. QuTiP has a wide user base, and we're beyond the stage where ""iterate fast and break things"" is ok for us (though of course it's fine and even good for pre-stable libraries, to avoid getting weighed down). We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment _without_ using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features? That's frustrating for users, even though it's not really anybody's fault. Bugging developers is fine when people want to use packages that are still maintained, but I'm sure we've all come up against times in research when you get to trying out a package to do one specific thing that's been abandoned for a while. Again, this certainly isn't an unsolvable problem: having versioning in the interface API is one solution to some of these problems. ---. For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining `__qutip_qobj__`, instead we expose an entry-point `qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None)`, and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. The logic inside the `Qobj` constructor remains approximately the same as what you suggest.

Availability,"itten it, this loop is thread-safe already. As it stands in the 4.x series, `mesolve` is re-entrant (I'm fairly sure), but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass a `QobjEvo` Liouvillian as the first argument. As long as you make sure you give each thread a distinct copy of the input Liouvillian, `mesolve` itself doesn't access global state as far as I recall. Just to be clear: there's two interconnected issues here: One is just being ""reentrant"" in the sense that I can safely have multiple `mesolve`'s run in parallel. This doesn't seem to be a problem for `mesolve` as a whole (propagating over the entire time grid). The other issue, at a lower level is whether I can keep the internal state of the integrator (`scipy.integrate.ode` or whatever else `mesolve` might be using) when propagating a single time step (and whether I can have multiple integrators to run in parallel that each safely keep track of their own state). That comes down to the integrator itself being ""reentrant"", of course. Certainly, calling `mesolve` in a loop (`In [19]`) doesn't keep the internal state of the integrator, hence the overhead between `In [21]` compared to `In [18]`. I wouldn't expect it to, of course, but the question is whether a refactoring of `mesolves` internals into an object that keeps state in a thread-safe way and allows doing time steps would alleviate this overhead (like the `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` that you propose in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859917462). On the other hand, looping over the full `mesolve` as in `In [19]` obviously has no problems with parallelization. I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by ""`mesolve` is re-entrant"" or whether recent changes in QuTiP now use a re-entrant internal integrator, i.e. not `scipy.integrate.ode`. At the time I implemented the [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/k",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:6209,down,down,6209,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"ken. I'm not sure I agree that implementing `__array_wrap__` is a good idea - `Qobj` does not support ufunc semantics, and implementing that implies that we're a similar class to `ndarray`, which I don't think we are. I don't think `np.sin(qobj)` should return `ndarray` _or_ `Qobj`; I think it should be a TypeError. To me, we should be rather conservative about adding features like that when there's little tangible benefit - when there's a slightly more explicit alternative syntax, it's better to fail-safe than add potential ""gotchas"". The fact that elementwise operations are not part of the algebra of `Qobj` should be enough of a reason to cause you to have to explicitly ask for it, otherwise it tacitly _becomes_ part of the algebra. For your point three, if that's the case, I'd argue you're doing something wrong: are you constructing the `Qobj` before you've finalised your data? Shouldn't it be; ```python; incomplete_data = np.array([[theta, 0, 0], ...]); return Qobj(np.sin(incomplete_data)); ```; not; ```python; return np.sin(Qobj(incomplete_data)); ```. As a compromise, we could ensure that all our data-layer types (`CSR`, `Dense`, whatever else) will support ufuncs with ndarray syntax; then you could do `Qobj(np.sin(qobj.data))` to be explicitly elementwise if you really wanted, rather than absolutely requiring you to produce a full dense matrix. I'm still not sure I see the use case there, though. I'm in favour of removing `np.array([qobj1, qobj2, ...], dtype=object)` usage inside QuTiP no matter which way we come down on this, though. As far as I recall from seeing it, there no reason to use `ndarray` over a regular Python list in any of our internal use, and it's rarely (if ever) actually returned out of a QuTiP function. Given it might cause subtle differences between different numpy versions, probably best to avoid it.

Availability,"le for all known types automatically; when it's asked to do say `kron` on two types it doesn't have a specialisation for, it'll cast the inputs through a path of least weight into a specialisation it _does_ know, and then use that. The desired casting rules and preferred output types can be altered dynamically at run-time as well. While I put a lot of effort into making this as fast as possible (and naturally a constant-time operation with respect to the number of known types and specialisations), of course the penalty we pay is a small run-time cost of type look-ups and dispatch (<1µs, but that's dwarfed by the cost of the operations themselves). We will have a hook for creating ""data-layer types"" out of arbitrary inputs, but we weren't heavily focussing on this at all; it seems rather too special a case to have _another_ magic interface for, and we can basically just reuse `__array__` for it - ""data-layer types"" are essentially just ""matrix-like"" objects. It also isn't appropriate for the situation you're describing here, because your own objects have additional ""quantum-specific"" attributes associated with them, similar to the extra stuff that `Qobj` contains. If you want to see more of this, it's in the `dev.major` branch. ---. Defining an interoperable new public interface I think is quite a big task, since it's inherently got to be future-proof. I'm definitely +1 on us having one, and having some discussion about it before a 5.0 release. I'm most concerned with how we can do it in a manner that's useful without stymieing our own ability to iterate and improve. It's harder for downstream packages to support multiple versions of a magic interface than it is for them to changing call QuTiP library functions; with deprecation warnings we can have multiple valid methods for doing the same thing alive in the library at once, but we can't detect what version of an interface a downstream package requires (not keen on the idea of a `__qutip_qobj_api_version__` flag!!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:7704,down,downstream,7704,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,3,"['alive', 'down']","['alive', 'downstream']"

Disadvantages that I can think of:; - It's got linear scaling with the number of conversions registered, so it's in theory possible to register ""too many"" and cause a slow down. In reality, this will be a very small effect (`Qobj` construction time will be dominated by copying data into new formats), and I think the benefits of a priority queue of allowed converters outweighs it in convenience for users.; - It involves some global state of the `qutip` library, which _may_ cause problems for multiprocessing if somebody tries to register a `lambda` converter (can't pass through `pickle`, though I'm not 100% on whether module-level stuff needs to), and of course there's the query of what happens when converters are registered in separate processes. We already have this ""problem"" in 5.0 though, because that's how the entire underlying dispatch mechanism is handled; we can just require that converters must be pickle-able.; - If a downstream package wants to lazily `import qutip` (we're a pretty heavy import right now), it's harder in this method; you'd basically have to ask a user to call `otherlibrary.register_qutip()`. For one, I'm going to put some effort into making `import qutip` take much less time for 5.0 (the main problem right now is we essentially eagerly import all of scipy and IPython if it's around), so that'll make it a bit easier. For two, a single initialisation statement isn't _necessarily_ a terrible thing; users can decide for themselves if they want to install the implicit integrations, but this is definitely an inconvenience relative to the magic method. ---.

Availability,"m_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no other package will ever be called QuTiP. If it's a hidden name, it doesn't matter how ""pretty"" it is.; 2. having the check in `__init__` might not be correct - it feels like it belongs in `__new__` to me. `__init__` modifies an object that's already been created in Python-space, whereas `__new__` allows you to replace the object creation entirely.; 3. we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve `Qobj.__init__` between major versions. If _we_ define a public interface like this rather than having external libraries provide their own implementations, it puts the burden of maintain compatability on us, and takes it off downstream packages, who are able to define version requirements. For example, calling `otherlib.obj.toqobj()` and having it fail with QuTiP next.0 makes it clear that `otherlib` isn't compatible with QuTiP next, whereas `Qobj(otherlib.obj)` failing would (rightly) be taken as QuTiP being at fault, which stymies our development a little because we're forced to be more conservative than we otherwise would be with our constructor. This is going to be a particular problem with handling `dims`, since we're talking about completely changing the structure for how that's managed internally to help us in other parts of our library.; 4. what will happen with all the other keyword arguments passed to the `Qobj` constructor? We have probably three choices:; - pass all keywords on (which is a big problem in conjunction with the point above);; - pass none of them on, call `__qutip_qobj__` within `Qobj.__new__`, and then pass through `Qobj",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:2667,down,downstream,2667,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['down'],['downstream']

At a later stage, some more refined example applications could be provided. * Review is still ongoing, I will provide comments on the .py files and other solvers files.

Availability,"n at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, when the Python allocators do a little bit of checksumming. I think that in _all_ cases we're seeing the failure come from the garbage collection, but I can't be 100% certain - note that this almost certainly means the failure is somewhere completely different, and it's only _detected_ at garbage collection.

Availability,"obj(data, dims=dims, copy=False, type='oper', isherm=...); ```; providing `data` is actually of a valid (`fast_csr_matrix`) format. Technically the `Qobj.data` attribute will be a new object that wraps the same numpy arrays as was passed, rather than the same `fast_csr_matrix`. In various forms, `expect` already does check the Hermicity, that's why `mc-dm` is careful to set it to avoid recalculating it. The expect functions in `qutip.expect` do this directly, and aren't aware of column-stacked density matrices - they'll just raise a TypeError. `mesolve` and `mcsolve` now bypass the `Qobj` stage and go direct to Cython - in 5.0 it might not be a terrible idea to route everything back through the `Qobj` form, since the performance issues there are solved (a column-stacked dense matrix can be directly wrapped by an f-ordered `Dense` type), and it's the natural central point of the code (and those parts are called from Python-space anyway, so no C concerns). Here though, the problem is actually that the expectation generator in `mesolve` correctly calculates the dtype of the output expectation array using both the state and the expectation operator, but then it does it incorrectly in the loop, and passes the hermicity down to Cython using only the expectation operator, which promptly throws out the complex part. So setting `fast='mc-dm'` in `Qobj` is a symptom of the same root cause as the problem here, rather than the cause itself. At the start of `mesolve` we don't assume that the state is Hermitian, but then inside the integration loop we do. We can still keep the speedup - if the output was created with a complex dtype, we can always safely say that we're passing in non-Hermitian operators, even if coincidentally at one timestep they happen to be anyway.

Availability,"plicit conversions. I really do appreciate the interest, and I _am_ keen to let us have better compatibility with the rest of the community, but there are a lot of design concerns that we're going to want to work on our side first - I just want to caution you in case you're trying to work towards a PR, because I'm not close to being happy to accept one, yet. If we're going to do this (and we haven't decided if we will yet), we're going to need to get a lot of wide-ranging input from many different libraries, and we'll want to write out a proper design document and get approval of it before we get deep into the implementation. > The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip.; >; > I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. I'm concerned from a user's perspective. QuTiP has a wide user base, and we're beyond the stage where ""iterate fast and break things"" is ok for us (though of course it's fine and even good for pre-stable libraries, to avoid getting weighed down). We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment _without_ using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features? That's frustrating for users, even though it's not really anybody's fault. Bugging developers is fine when people want to use packages that are still maintained, but I'm sure we've all come up against times in research when you get to trying out a package to do one specific thing that's been abandoned for a while.

The one exception would be an idempotent matrix, but again, I do not think this is encountered in practice. I will have a look at the Spinach methods. Seems to be similar to the Matlab code, scaling, Pade, then squaring. The SciPy dense and sparse expm uses the same Higham algorithm as Matlab, so it should be good.; - Paul. > On Apr 8, 2016, at 08:38, Alexander Pitchford notifications@github.com wrote:; > ; > I tried some experiments with elementwise exp with numpy to see if mkl did any parallel processing.

Availability,"regarding porting it directly into qutip, and we agreed it would be a good addition as a separate solver. There are a couple of we-believe-good reasons to provide <code>krylovsolve</code> as another qutip solver. As you mention, the method is currently limited to constant closed system Hamiltonians. Another possible addition discussed during the meetings was support for open quantum systems, which provides another unitary-fund grant opportunity for some students!. Another important application for many-body systems comes in handy with Krylov. Given the memory limitations from matrix representation of operators and the exponential growth of many-body systems Hilbert spaces, the limit of qubits on which the solvers live is around 15 qubits. This limitation gets expanded (in exchange for some slow down in the computations) to a few more qubits exploiting the binary operational nature of many-body systems. While any solver could use operations instead of matrices, it is a good testing bead to use Krylov's algorithm because of a property when constructing this space. This feature is a must-have within our research group, and everyone could also benefit from it. More importantly, Krylov is gaining increasing interest in the research community, and we believe that providing it as a qutip solver will increase the traffic of the repository. Regarding benchmarks and some documentation, we have a public jupyter notebook with some benchmarks here [krylov use examples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7ng8q9QNEzaZ97vGop3aIip8GPtl3GR?usp=sharing), and there's also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@julian.ruffinelli/krylov-approximation-method-for-quantum-evolution-148b3f023ec4) with some other details. As for maintenance, yes, the way this code-block fits in should not be problematic to update even with qutip changes. We use <code>krylovsolve</code> for research and will keep the solver repo outside qutip up to date and (hopefully!) inside of it for the community.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528:1865,mainten,maintenance,1865,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Availability,"ries define for them, but can add their own conversions or override library ones if they don't like them. I actually see this as being closer to Julia's dispatch, or Rust's `impl for`.; - It doesn't involve weird namespacing, or anything like that, and doesn't require downstream classes to carry around additional slots. It's less an issue for classes that define `__slots__` since those are frozen methods, but extra methods adds a minor amount vtable weight for most libraries, and makes their class definitions more complex.; - Control between different versions is perhaps a little easier (though a minor point): this _feels_ easier to separate out different versions, and detect what to register as the conversion function with QuTiP. This is a particular advantage for Python classes compiled as C-extensions (like from C or Cython), which typically don't allow assigning methods dynamically.; - A library could even register multiple versions of the conversion function with us, and let QuTiP handle API versioning centrally, rather than requiring downstream libraries to roll their own checks.; - We're basically already set up to do this in `dev.major` already. We'd have to modify our procedures a little bit (we're mostly concerned with constructing the underlying matrices at the moment), but it's a smaller change in behaviour. Disadvantages that I can think of:; - It's got linear scaling with the number of conversions registered, so it's in theory possible to register ""too many"" and cause a slow down. In reality, this will be a very small effect (`Qobj` construction time will be dominated by copying data into new formats), and I think the benefits of a priority queue of allowed converters outweighs it in convenience for users.; - It involves some global state of the `qutip` library, which _may_ cause problems for multiprocessing if somebody tries to register a `lambda` converter (can't pass through `pickle`, though I'm not 100% on whether module-level stuff needs to), and o",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691:6677,down,downstream,6677,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"s a minor amount vtable weight for most libraries, and makes their class definitions more complex.; - Control between different versions is perhaps a little easier (though a minor point): this _feels_ easier to separate out different versions, and detect what to register as the conversion function with QuTiP. This is a particular advantage for Python classes compiled as C-extensions (like from C or Cython), which typically don't allow assigning methods dynamically.; - A library could even register multiple versions of the conversion function with us, and let QuTiP handle API versioning centrally, rather than requiring downstream libraries to roll their own checks.; - We're basically already set up to do this in `dev.major` already. We'd have to modify our procedures a little bit (we're mostly concerned with constructing the underlying matrices at the moment), but it's a smaller change in behaviour. Disadvantages that I can think of:; - It's got linear scaling with the number of conversions registered, so it's in theory possible to register ""too many"" and cause a slow down. In reality, this will be a very small effect (`Qobj` construction time will be dominated by copying data into new formats), and I think the benefits of a priority queue of allowed converters outweighs it in convenience for users.; - It involves some global state of the `qutip` library, which _may_ cause problems for multiprocessing if somebody tries to register a `lambda` converter (can't pass through `pickle`, though I'm not 100% on whether module-level stuff needs to), and of course there's the query of what happens when converters are registered in separate processes. We already have this ""problem"" in 5.0 though, because that's how the entire underlying dispatch mechanism is handled; we can just require that converters must be pickle-able.; - If a downstream package wants to lazily `import qutip` (we're a pretty heavy import right now), it's harder in this method; you'd basically have to ask a ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691:7135,down,down,7135,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830003691,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"s ea1c129 to b4f75cf as ""new"" (the first three commits of this PR). However, when those commits are taken together, they make the same changes as commit 4102b99 (the one which merged #1242) in `qutip/master`. The Github ""Files changed"" dialog is a pretty-printed version of the `git` command `git diff qutip/master...Canoming/master`, which means ""show all changes on either branch since `qutip/master` and `Canoming/master` diverged"". Because they diverged before #1242 was merged, it includes those changes. The merge completes without conflict, however, because `git` is clever and recognises that the changes introduced in the two branches `qutip/master` and `Canoming/master` are identical, even though the commits are different. As a consequence, however, merging this PR without squashing it would cause commits ea1c129 to b4f75cf to suddenly appear in our commit history, which we don't want. ### If Canoming wanted to fix this (not necessary). First run; ```; git remote add qutip https://github.com/qutip/qutip.git; git fetch qutip; ```; to add the upstream `qutip` remote. Then run; ```; git checkout master; git rebase -i $(git merge-base qutip/master master); ```; and modify the file so that the instruction list looks like (only the first word of each line changes); ```; pick ea1c129a fix function QubitCircuit.remove_gate; fixup 3bd94603 fix function QubitCircui.remove_gate; fixup b4f75cfe fix; pick 4aa90f56 fix bug in QubitCircuit.add_circuit; pick 3a2676de fix function QubitCircuit.add_circuit; pick 58aebc7f fix indent; ```; Should you save and close the file, it would modify your commit history. We'd only do this to avoid a merge conflict which would otherwise occur in the next step. Then, run; ```; git rebase qutip/master; ```; which should complete without error. Finally, your local `master` would now have diverged from Github's copy (and this PR's), so you'd have to force-push the changes by doing; ```; git push --force; ```; which would update this PR accordingly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1269#issuecomment-629701269:2842,error,error,2842,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1269#issuecomment-629701269,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"ssues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions which depend on those. It comes with the same disadvantage of relatively tight coupling, but is somehow more flexible and powerful than just setting the seeds.; - I have used Hypothesis in the past (on a relatively small-scale project), and it's indeed a great framework with a lot of interesting and nice functionalities. I like it very much, but one disadvantage I ran into was the increased overall time for completion of a test run. In my case, a viable approach, for instance, was to run my Hypothesis tests (which were a subset of all tests) with a bit larger periodicity (in the CI pipeline) than the regular tests. Another concern that I intuitively have (I may be _wildly_ wrong on this one, though, not having yet properly explored QuTiP's testing landscape) is that - depending on how some Hypothesis tests are set up - there might be a cost incurred in that, eventually, one might have to implement guards against inputs, that would be virtually impossible (or very close to that) to occur in practical scenarios. In any case, I'd strongly recommend performing a time-boxed experiment on a small subset of tests, which are more suited to property-based testing, and examining how that affects the test-run-completion time(s) and whether it introduces more failures than what would be desired/cost-efficient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:3269,failure,failures,3269,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,1,['failure'],['failures']
Availability,"st sub- and super-diagonals look like; ```[sqrt(1), -sqrt(2), sqrt(3), -sqrt(4), ...]```; and the diagonal of `P` looks like; ```[i, e^(-1i arg(alpha)), i e^(-2i arg(alpha)), e^(-3i arg(alpha)), ...]```. Now this real-symmetric tridiagonal form is the basis of Hermitian eigenvalue solvers, and has direct entry points in LAPACK (e.g. `?stemr`), which allow us to pass only the main diagonal and the first subdiagonal. Scipy provides convenient wrapped access in Python by `scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis. We now have a diagonalised matrix `G = Q^-1 . D . Q`, so `exp(G) = Q^-1 . exp(D) . Q`, which is now trivial because `D` is diagonal. Putting all this together allows us to use our knowledge of the problem domain to convert the matrix exponentiation problem into a much simpler real-symmetric tridiagonal eigensystem problem, which gets us a nice big speed up, and it's equivalent up to the tolerance of the eigenvalue solver (~1e-14). Even better for you, a lot of the hard work is done in the eigensystem solver, and I scaled out `alpha` at the start, so we can do a good chunk _without fixing alpha_. That means we can pay the computational cost only once at the start, and then get faster calculations from then on. If I make a totally fair test, and simply replicate the full functionality of `qutip.displace` (including creating a `Qobj` at the end), my method is ~4x faster on small matrices (`1 <= dim <= 20`) and it only goes up from there (I found it's about ~10x faster at `dim = 1000`, and beyond that `qutip.displace` is too slow to bother). If I store the calculation of the eigensystem, and output an `ndarray` instead of converting to `csr_matrix` (and so don't produce a `Qobj`), then I find speed ups in getting the operator for a new `alpha` as ~100x for small matr",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-645685030:2015,toler,tolerance,2015,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-645685030,1,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"started looking into QuTiP only very recently, and I'm yet to start familiarising myself with its more intricate details and get to run the full set of tests, and investigate what kind of test failures occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions which depend on those. It comes with the same disadvantage of relatively tight coupling, but is somehow more flexible and powerful than just setting the seeds.; - I have used Hypothesis in the past (on a relatively small-scale project), and it's indeed a great framework with a lot of interesting and nice functionalities. I like it very much, but one disadvantage I ran into was the increased overall time for completion of a test run. In my case, a viable approach, for instance, was to run my Hypothesis tests (which were a subset of all tests) with a bit larger periodicity (in the CI pipeline) than the regular tests.

Availability,"t handling, which comes at the price of some overhead, but which is negligible compared to the runtime cost for most meaningfully large systems. I'd then like to state that; - *I have never suggested to insert a mechanism to insert implicit conversion in the low-level operations.* ; - In this RFC in no way have I proposed to implement implicit conversion anywhere else then were is already done in qutip itself. All I stated was that `I played around with auto-converting input hamiltonians and jump operators in qutip.sesolve and mesolve to Qobj if they are not Qobj but support the interface. That is even nicer because we would get to use all of qutip solvers out of the box with our objects.`. ; - So implicitly I do have stated that I'd like to see implicit conversion being performed on high-level methods. I do see benefits for the whole ecosystem if we can start integrating more: qutip already has very advanced and feature-complete solvers, there are large benefits for other packages to exploit them without having to wrap them or ask users to write more complicated code. It means that all benefits and bug-fixes to qutip are instantly available to users of other packages too that rely on it. And I think that calling a conversion method at the beginning, which most of the time will do nothing will just be a tiny drop in the bucket of the overhead of those `large` functions. However, I don't want to argue that right now. All my proposal was about was having a way to play well with your `Qobj` constructor.; It seems to me you were eventually favourable to this, so I propose we focus the discussion only on this point, and leave aside implicit or explicit conversion discussions. . I'll gladly open another issue to discuss implicit conversion, if you want, or we could organise a small round table among a bunch of developers to talk about this on skype, but for now, all i'm asking, is to agree on the design of an interface to allow easy conversion of objects to qutip objects.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687:2749,avail,available,2749,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"t some point we do `qeye(L.shape[0])` instead of `qeye(L.dims[0])`. There's sometimes quite a bit of that in older code - it used to slip through because we weren't super strict about dimension handling, so in certain cases (like this one), we'd accept bad dimensions. I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix.

Availability,"the best, general way to do it. I think this is part of much larger discussion about how to handle tensor networks - for example, at the moment, `targets` is fine for states and operators, but it won't work for superoperators. I'm not sure that this is solvable in an ergonomic way with QuTiP's current dimensions specifiers, but it's something we're definitely going to look into after the initial release of 5.0. Also, there are already several disparate functions in QuTiP that provide sort-of similar functionality, and I think we need to have a proper go at tidying them all up into one cohesive interface. This includes `subsystem_apply` (most similar to this), but also `ptrace` and `partial_tranpose`, which can be seen as special cases of this exact same type of tensor contraction (not to mention `tensor_contract`!). The other thing from a code perspective is that this doesn't use the data-layer in the intended manner. A lot of this may be because our documentation of the data-layer isn't readily available yet (we weren't expecting interest this early!). It does individual detection on two different types, rather than creating a `Dispatcher` to handle the multiple dispatch over potentially different data types of the two inputs. I would imagine that a better form of organisation for this sort of routine, which will be able to handle arbitrary tensor-network operations, will end up being made up of two components:; 1. a `Dispatcher` version of something akin to `einsum`, with a couple of limitations; 2. a high-level wrapper function to handle the specific case of local multiplication, which examines the dimensions and target specifiers to produce the input to the `einsum`-like function, then calls the `Dispatcher` with this information. I think this form would likely be preferable for several reasons:; 1. it will allow arbitrary mixing of different data types (`CSR` complete space and `Dense` operator, or both `CSR`, or whatever), with the allowed conversions respecti",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566:2305,avail,available,2305,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"ther libraries want to interact with QuTiP! In the interests of inciting more discussion, I've got thrown in some more discussion points below - I'm 100% sure they're all solvable, but it also seems like there isn't one way that's unambiguously correct to do them, so they're worth discussing. ---. In principle I'm happy to implement this, though I don't really agree with your assertion that `othertype.toqobj()` is bad style! It might be so in Julia, but Python doesn't have all the same multiple-dispatch niceties that Julia has, so at the end of the day, we have to add in a method with a ""magic"" name somewhere, and it all just comes down to choosing the name of the method. The downside to having a magic name is that it means we have to eschew proper namespacing; what if another library one day wants to call their interface the same thing? Then it's completely impossible for a downstream library to interoperate with both. Having conversions be a non-special method of the downstream class, and leaving our constructor unaware of them alleviates that issue. Numpy can get away with squatting the `__array__` name because they're _huge_, but I would argue that if we do it, we could actually _harm_ the quantum software ecosystem in the long-run - what happens when a package better than QuTiP comes along that wants to call its objects `Qobj` as well? Let's face it - it's a pretty straightforward name!. All that said, I am very aware that not everyone agrees with me on this, and I _am_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no other package will ever be called QuTiP. If it's a hidden name, it doesn't matter how ""pretty"" it is.; 2. havin",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:1093,down,downstream,1093,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, when the Python allocators do a little bit of checksumming. I think that in _all_ cases we're seeing the failure come from the garbage collection, but I can't be 100% certain - note that this almost certainly means the failure is somewhere completely different, and it's only _detected_ at garbage collection. Here is the output of a Python 3.8 crash on the `Malloc.py` file with some additional debugging enabled.

Availability,"to caution you in case you're trying to work towards a PR, because I'm not close to being happy to accept one, yet. If we're going to do this (and we haven't decided if we will yet), we're going to need to get a lot of wide-ranging input from many different libraries, and we'll want to write out a proper design document and get approval of it before we get deep into the implementation. > The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip.; >; > I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. I'm concerned from a user's perspective. QuTiP has a wide user base, and we're beyond the stage where ""iterate fast and break things"" is ok for us (though of course it's fine and even good for pre-stable libraries, to avoid getting weighed down). We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment _without_ using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features? That's frustrating for users, even though it's not really anybody's fault. Bugging developers is fine when people want to use packages that are still maintained, but I'm sure we've all come up against times in research when you get to trying out a package to do one specific thing that's been abandoned for a while. Again, this certainly isn't an unsolvable problem: having versioning in the interface API is one solution to some of these problems. ---.

Availability,"torial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have. What I did instead is, I tried to make it clear in the documentation that the default value might be unsuitable for MPI applications, and I emit a warning if the default value is used.

Availability,"ucer. Ok, so now let me cut it down to a minimum `eig.py`:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scipy.linalg. x = np.random.rand(25, 25) + 1j*np.random.rand(25, 25); scipy.linalg.eig(x); ```. Note that this file does not even use `qutip`. You can run `PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler,tracemalloc eig.py`, and it will occasionally trigger a segfault (it happens to me about 1 in 5 times). It's not always the same message as above, e.g.:; ```; jake@tauros$ PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler,tracemalloc eig.py; python(54517,0x10a5505c0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fe6cb4150e0: probably modified after being freed.; Corrupt value: 0x3ff0000000000000; python(54517,0x10a5505c0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug; Abort trap: 6; ```. However if I run it within valgrind:; ```; jake@tauros$ valgrind --suppressions=valgrind-python.supp python -Xfaulthandler eig.py; ==54530== Memcheck, a memory error detector; ==54530== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.; ==54530== Using Valgrind-3.17.0.GIT-lbmacos and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info; ==54530== Command: python -Xfaulthandler eig.py; ==54530==; ==54530== Invalid write of size 8; ==54530== at 0x10ABF7A8A: ???

I'm now reasonably convinced that this isn't directly an issue with QuTiP. I suspect it isn't an issue with `scipy` either, but I'm not sure - it looks like a slight overwrite in MKL on macOS, though it's also possible that `scipy` passes some invalid pointers when dropping down to BLAS/LAPACK. I get the impression that the next steps involve dropping down a level of abstraction, down to Cython to directly call scipy's wrappers, or even fully down t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807:7333,error,error,7333,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807,1,['error'],['error']

This was done with commit 624405e7, SciPy 1.6.2 and Numpy 1.19.5. My BLAS version has chopped and changed an awful lot, but I believe that run was with MKL implementations. The ""random"" stack trace from pytest looks to me like the error came about during garbage collection, and I really don't imagine pytest is to blame. We have in the past had issues with some bad calls in SciPy linalg functions, so it's _possible_ that they are the cause again, but I doubt it; we'd expect the stack traces to reliably show scipy to be the problem in that case. I wasn't able to reproduce this segfault on Windows, but that doesn't mean a huge amount, because I also can't reliably reproduce it on Mac. I suspect that the cause is some dodgy handling of pointers in the `struct CSR_Matrix` type in `qutip/cy/sparse_routines.pxi`, but this is just a suspicion. As far as I remember, I have _never_ seen this segfault when using the `dev.major` branch, which completely removes `CSR_Matrix` and replaces it with a much more robust Cython `CSR` type, which adds to my suspicion, but again, because the reproducer is unreliable, I cannot be sure.

Availability,"why I was suggesting that `object.__qutip_qobj__` should not return a Qobj directly, but rather the data needed by QuTiP to construct a Qobj, and qutip should be free to re-organize it afterwards as he likes. . > 3 - we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve Qobj.__init__ between major versions. You could for example require that `__qutip_qobj__(self, version, *kwargs)` takes in a version of the API? I believe that is what numpy does in `__array_interface__`. And it's on implementers of the interface the burden of checking the api version and throwing an error if it's not supported. Or the inverse, where implementers return whatever data they return and a version of the API they are using, and qutip can throw an error if that is an older version. The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip. I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. -- ; About keyword handling: copy-pasting the list of kwargs of `Qobj`...; ```python; inpt : array_like = Data for vector/matrix representation of the quantum object.; dims : list = Dimensions of object used for tensor products.; shape : list = Shape of underlying data structure (matrix shape).; copy : bool = Flag specifying whether Qobj should get a copy of the input data, or use the original.; fast : bool = Flag for fast qobj creation when running ode solvers.; ```. For the case of the usage that netket would have, our objects already define the Hilbert space they are acting on (so `dims` and `shape`). `copy` doesn't really make sense for us, because we would be building the representation .

Availability,"y given that developing this module is no longer my primary research focus in grad school. There are a few ways we could proceed:; 1. I could refactor the functions into a `Scatterer` class and export only the class, without adding dedicated multiprocessing support. This would make parallelizing parameter searches much more difficult - see my thoughts above.; 2. I could export both the flat functions and the `Scatterer` class (sans multiprocessing) which wraps these functions, and users could use the former for parallel searches. I don't like this option, since it clutters up the module and introduces multiple ways to do things. (""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."" ~ [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)); 3. We could merge the current version of the module as-is and I can refactor into a class with properly-implemented parallelism in a later version. (I think it would be best to combine this with other similar API-breaking refactorings in v5.0.). Personally, I think option 3 is the best way to proceed. I am committed to maintaining and updating this module in the long term and I do think that refactoring much of QuTiP to be more object-oriented will be a positive change to the framework. However, consider that: (1) properly rewriting this as a class-based module without losing functionality will take some time, (2) there are many other modules (for example, most solvers) which would benefit from being refactored into classes, and (3) rewriting these modules would be a breaking API change. . These reasons make me think it would be best to merge the current module now, including it in version 4.3 of QuTiP, and to refactor this (among many other modules) in version 5.0 of QuTiP. This option would make this module available quickly, would be most consistent with semantic versioning, and would keep this module's structure consistent with QuTiP in both pre-refactor v4.X and post-refactor v5.X.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-386114501:3490,avail,available,3490,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-386114501,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"—; Let me begin by saying that I completely understand your concerns. I am not trying to enforce a view on the QuTiP project, but rather as I see; I would like the various frameworks in the vast ‘quantum’ ecosystem to ; coexist in such a way that makes easy for users to jump from one tool to the other easily. I personally envisage an ecosystem where one can write down an hamiltonian in the tool of choice, obtain the exact time evolution with qutip, and maybe have a look at it’s semiclassical trajectory. Jump into netket and check if a variational representation can properly capture the correlations. Trotterize the hamiltonian and get a circuit, without worrying about how to convert from one framework to the other. . I want to start the discussion on this topic eagerly because I am aware that it will take a fairly long time. If there is anything I can do to make your future internal discussions easier, do let me know. > I just want to caution you in case you're trying to work towards a PR. Indeed. I was just trying to play around with this. . > If we're going to do this (and we haven't decided if we will yet), we're going to need to get a lot of wide-ranging input from many different libraries. I completely agree with your approach. I’m simply trying to push for this to be something that will come out in a reasonable timeframe and not be something forgotten. > We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment without using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features?. I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742:366,down,down,366,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742,1,['down'],['down']

Error mitigation in QuTiP; >; > From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy; > quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced; > features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise; > models. A new class Processor and several subclasses are added to; > represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a; > quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the; > dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to; > qutip.qip.noise to simulate noise in a quantum device.; >; > This module is still young and many features can be improved, including; > new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing; > general framework for quantum circuits (qutip.qip.circuit). There are; > also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3].; >; > The tutorial notebooks can be found at; > http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq.

Deployability," module is small and very focussed. 2. Exactly - it's more of an internal type. Currently `Qobj` converts the underlying data object to dense `ndarray` and prints it for its `repr` method - I don't have any plans to change that, so `Qobj` will still be full and user-facing. My `CSR` repr actually just tells you the same information that `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` does, just in a slightly more Python-looking form. 3. Yes, in some form or another. Perhaps we could talk about the best way to do that in a future meeting?. 4. `PyDataMem_NEW` isn't actually a Python routine, it's a numpy one, but that's largely irrelevant. The Python equivalent is `cpython.mem.PyMem_Malloc` and family. The reason I don't use the latter in general is because sometimes `PyMem_Malloc` allocates into Python-reserved stack-space, and if we subsequently pass the pointer to numpy, it will try to free it and cause a segfault. The reason for using `malloc` and `free` here is mostly just because there was a comment in the code I copied it from saying that raw `malloc` and `free` were slightly faster for allocating heap space to be released within the same function, so I just did what they did. I can change it - it's not important. When allocating space that _may_ be passed to numpy, I always use `PyDataMem_NEW` (or friends). 5. That's a mistake - I meant to take out that ability in `matmul_csr` because it's just asking for trouble (the user won't know how much space to allocate, and we're basically just asking for a segfault). I did `matmul_csr` first, and I hadn't decided yet exactly what I was doing. 6. Yeah, I'm going to add additional `imul`, `ineg` and `idiv` routines as dispatched operations. 7. LAPACK/BLAS as far as we can. I've no pretense to being able to write faster code than hardware-specific optimised stuff for matrices.

Deployability," right now if that internally we'd keep column-stacking/unstacking the state, but in the 5.x branch it'll stop being represented internally by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. In the form I've written it, this loop is thread-safe already. As it stands in the 4.x series, `mesolve` is re-entrant (I'm fairly sure), but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass a `QobjEvo` Liouvillian as the first argument. As long as you make sure you give each thread a distinct copy of the input Liouvillian, `mesolve` itself doesn't access global state as far as I recall. QuTiP 5 is (probably) going to formalise that (^) sort of low-level calling convention of `mesolve`, but it should work already. The new one look a bit different because instead of doing the setup very manually, there'll be a ""low-level"" function to prepare a master equation problem (and a Schrodinger equation one, etc), and then there'll be a `step` method instead of calling the ""high-level"" interface function `mesolve`, but functionally it'll do largely the same, just with a lot less data copying than the current form has to do. In the new system, it's likely that the function `mesolve` itself will keep the exact same interface it has now, just internally most of its processing will be split into modular components, each of which will be accessible (with different names) to the user to compose themselves, if they want low-level access. We're unlikely to add `yield` to `mesolve` directly because that's a very breaking change to one of QuTiP's core functions (we can't return from a generator, or at least not ergonomically), but we are splitting up the `mesolve` monolith into a much more modular architecture, and making it more user-accessible.

Deployability," since with numpy now *everything* is dense (including the Hamiltonian), whereas the best thing to do numerically would be to do sparse-matrix-dense-vector operations (which is what we do in Fortran, incidentally). > In the form I've written it, this loop is thread-safe already.

As long as you make sure you give each thread a distinct copy of the input Liouvillian, `mesolve` itself doesn't access global state as far as I recall. Just to be clear: there's two interconnected issues here: One is just being ""reentrant"" in the sense that I can safely have multiple `mesolve`'s run in parallel. This doesn't seem to be a problem for `mesolve` as a whole (propagating over the entire time grid). The other issue, at a lower level is whether I can keep the internal state of the integrator (`scipy.integrate.ode` or whatever else `mesolve` might be using) when propagating a single time step (and whether I can have multiple integrators to run in parallel that each safely keep track of their own state). That comes down to the integrator itself being ""reentrant"", of course. Certainly, calling `mesolve` in a loop (`In [19]`) doesn't keep the internal state of the integrator, hence the overhead between `In [21]` compared to `In [18]`. I wouldn't expect it to, of course, but the question is whether a refactoring of `mesolves` internals into an object that keeps state in a thread-safe way and allows doing time steps would alleviate this overhead (like the `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` that you propose in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859917462).

Deployability," surprised how much better `DensityMatrixODEPropagator` performs compared to looping over `mesolve` (`In [29]` vs `In [21]`): Since the `DensityMatrixODEPropagator` also re-initializes `scipy.integrate.ode` in every time steps, it would seem like the only difference between the two is the overhead of `mesolve` deciding that it has to handle the specific case of density matrix propagation. That might be something to keep an eye on in future QuTiP development: Ideally, calling `mesolve` would have negligible overhead compared to manually doing whatever `mesolve` does internally for a particular case. > We're unlikely to add `yield` to `mesolve` directly because that's a very breaking change to one of QuTiP's core functions (we can't return from a generator, or at least not ergonomically), but we are splitting up the `mesolve` monolith into a much more modular architecture, and making it more user-accessible.

Deployability," this solver? It seems to be able to produce states which trace is not one, which seems strange. Thank you for your detailed comments! We are here at RIKEN working together with the authors of the paper linked above to try and add this functionality to qutip. So far, this PR is just a starting point for the collaboration, but proper documentation and examples are high on our priority list. To add some very quick explanation here: the master equation describing a general completely positive (but not necessarily CP-divisible) map can involve rate functions that become negative at some times. The usual Monte-Carlo algorithm cannot be applied in this case, but Donvil et al. describe [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31533-8) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08958) a workaround where states are weighted with an ""influence martingale"". Including this weight, the involved states are indeed not normalized; however, the state that results from an average over sufficiently many trajectories is normalized. (Checking *how well* the average is normalized could maybe be used as an indicator of how good the convergence is, as noted at the top.). > I am not too sure about adding the time parameter to `_restore_state`. In floquet, the state produced need a basis change depending on time, but it was put in the `Result` so the state before and after the transformation can be stored. Maybe something like this would be useful, it would allow the `mu` to be saved in results. Putting this calculation into the `Result` instead does sound reasonable to me. I am unsure how to achieve that in practice though, since the result class used for a single trajectory is hard-coded in mcsolve:; ```; result = Result(e_ops, {**self.options, ""normalize_output"": False}); ```; Note that in principle, we could also get the time from the integrator in _restore_state without adding it as a function parameter.

That comes down to the integrator itself being ""reentrant"", of course. Certainly, calling `mesolve` in a loop (`In [19]`) doesn't keep the internal state of the integrator, hence the overhead between `In [21]` compared to `In [18]`.

On the other hand, looping over the full `mesolve` as in `In [19]` obviously has no problems with parallelization. I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by ""`mesolve` is re-entrant"" or whether recent changes in QuTiP now use a re-entrant internal integrator, i.e. not `scipy.integrate.ode`. At the time I implemented the [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) by looking at what `mesolve` was doing at a low level for the specific case of density matrices, `scipy.integrate.ode` was definitely being used, and that couldn't handle propagating in parallel (and by ""parallel"" I include alternating propagation steps from two different propagations).

Deployability,"**Summary of what was done:**. - Changes in floquet_master_equation_rates to make it faster.; - Corrected transposition errors in _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and changes to make it faster. I also removed a line so that the ME is solved in the interaction picture, this implies a different basis change in the _floquet_markov_mesolve_ function.; - Correction in _floquet_markov_mesolve_. As explained in the point above, the Floquet-Markov ME was not being solved in the interaction picture, therefore I modified _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and modified the basis change in _floquet_markov_mesolve_. This modification requires an additional variable in the entry of _floquet_markov_mesolve_ which can not be chosen by default. For the moment, if this variable is not given and _floquet_basis=False_, then the density matrix or expectation values are returned in the interaction picture, in the computational basis, and a warning message is sent. ; - Added integration options in: _floquet_modes, floquet_modes_t, floquet_modes_table, floquet_states_t, floquet_modes_t, floquet_wavefunction_t, fsesolve, floquet_master_equation_rates, fmmesolve_; - Added test functions to verify the dissipative dynamics:; a) Compare _fmmesolve_ and _mesolve_ for the cases: (NO drive but dissipation) and (Drive but NO dissipation); b) Compare numerical and analytical matrix elements for a driven-dissipative TLS with RWA.

Deployability,", but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass a `QobjEvo` Liouvillian as the first argument. As long as you make sure you give each thread a distinct copy of the input Liouvillian, `mesolve` itself doesn't access global state as far as I recall. Just to be clear: there's two interconnected issues here: One is just being ""reentrant"" in the sense that I can safely have multiple `mesolve`'s run in parallel. This doesn't seem to be a problem for `mesolve` as a whole (propagating over the entire time grid). The other issue, at a lower level is whether I can keep the internal state of the integrator (`scipy.integrate.ode` or whatever else `mesolve` might be using) when propagating a single time step (and whether I can have multiple integrators to run in parallel that each safely keep track of their own state). That comes down to the integrator itself being ""reentrant"", of course. Certainly, calling `mesolve` in a loop (`In [19]`) doesn't keep the internal state of the integrator, hence the overhead between `In [21]` compared to `In [18]`. I wouldn't expect it to, of course, but the question is whether a refactoring of `mesolves` internals into an object that keeps state in a thread-safe way and allows doing time steps would alleviate this overhead (like the `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` that you propose in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859917462). On the other hand, looping over the full `mesolve` as in `In [19]` obviously has no problems with parallelization. I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by ""`mesolve` is re-entrant"" or whether recent changes in QuTiP now use a re-entrant internal integrator, i.e. not `scipy.integrate.ode`. At the time I implemented the [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) by looking at what `mesolve` was doing at a low level for the specific case of density ma",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:6359,integrat,integrator,6359,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['integrat'],['integrator']

Deployability,". I will briefly summarize what I found out and changed. Setting up and using an MPI environment is surprisingly difficult, and I don't think it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would r",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:1026,install,install,1026,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,3,['install'],"['install', 'installs']"

This is sometimes fixed in the first place by adding; ```; plt.show(); plt.close(); ```; but not always. Maybe we can have a look at this minor issue in the development notebooks. . **Documentation**; It would really increase the adoption rate if the API doc and User Guide could be updated to highlight the stochastic solvers and new methods. The development notebooks are so well written that drawing from their examples should be simple. . Congratulations @Ericgig for this refurbishment, improvement, optimization and thorough benchmarking investigations of the stochastic solvers, which I hope will be widely tested by @nwlambert @ajgpitch @quantshah (and @fminga) for robustness once merged in the development master branch. I am merging this and the montecarlo split PR, hoping there are no incompatibility issues (#990 --> #991 --> #969).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/990#issuecomment-500396003:6019,update,updated,6019,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/990#issuecomment-500396003,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"1. Don't worry, those aren't problems. A problem would just say ""FAIL"". ""XFAIL"" means ""expected to fail"", which in this case is because those tests were written for an older testing framework and haven't been updated yet.; 2. No, you don't need to worry. If it's installed, you'll get a message at the end which says something like; ```====== 1000 passed, 50 skipped, 10 xfailed in 120s ======```; where the numbers and times will be different, but there won't be any red text saying ""10 failed"" (""xfailed"" is fine). If you've installed `qutip` from `conda` following the [recommended instructions here](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html#platform-independent-installation), then you should have a valid installation without any issues, and Cython should have sorted itself out. The general principle is that installing `qutip` is as easy as running; ```conda install qutip```; if you've got the `conda-forge` channel activated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1222#issuecomment-606166596:209,update,updated,209,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1222#issuecomment-606166596,8,"['install', 'update']","['install', 'installation', 'installed', 'installing', 'updated']"
Deployability,"1. inside the ""Actions"" tab at the top of the GitHub page, you will only see workflows that are present in the code in the default git branch. `dev.major` isn't QuTiP's default branch, so the workflows won't appear immediately after this is merged, only when the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file also exists in `master`. 2. nothing prevents you from running the workflow on a fork, and there's no way and no reason to prevent this - it's also how I tested it. If you did run it on a fork, you'd be using your own GitHub Actions credits (it doesn't cost us anything because we're an open-source project). Only qutip/qutip knows the secret to publish to PyPI, so no fork can succeed on that. The branch check here serves two purposes: the first is that I needed some ""tickbox"" to let the admin decide at runtime whether they needed to publish the package or just build the wheels for personal download; the second is that we release off release branches, not master, so there needed to be an input to say _which_ branch should be built. 3. it's not 100% necessary, but it's the right thing to do. It decouples the project data from the setup code, which makes it much easier to modify both, and allows other tools to access the data. There are other PEPs in the works as well that will move all this data into `pyproject.toml`, rather than just `setup.cfg`. 4. oh, that's useful. I didn't really know or look into it, because it was only a temporary thing anyway. I might actually retire this PR and make it against `master` instead. It's functionally the same as this one, and most of the diff is the same, except that its `setup.py` is better organised, like Simon suggested.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429#issuecomment-801289045:925,release,release,925,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429#issuecomment-801289045,2,['release'],['release']

It was originally, but this was later changed to relax the secular approximation according to the ""importance"" of each term, which is dictated by a quotient. The numerator of the quotient is the product of the FFT coefficients that make up a certain element of the rate matrix super operator, and the denominator is the difference of frequencies between the two elements multiplied by the system frequency omega. When `time_sense` is `0`, the rate matrix is constructed using only the product of FFT coefficients for which the frequency arguments completely cancel. When `timesense` isn't `0`, however, is when that quotient comes into play. In a nutshell, this ends up dividing the rate at which a certain element changes the system by the frequency at which that rate rotates in the Floquet Basis. If the result of the quotient is small, the frequency is much higher than the collapse operator elements actually affect the system, such that it averages out on longer timescales. If the result of the quotient is large, then the collapse operator elements appreciably change the system on a shorter timescale than they rotate, such that their contribution to the overall matrix can't be ignored. If I've explained this poorly, which I suspect is the case since I'm not sure how to add equations here or if that's possible, I can email you with a more thorough explanation. . I haven't included tests for the latter case yet mostly due to my only dealing with systems heavily dictated by their primary frequency, so far. I'm working on a system now that should show different behavior for different secular approximations, but my results look slightly different from the published results such that I'm not sure I'm very confident in what I've done, yet. I'll try to update with a test for this when I can, however.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2186#issuecomment-1631503788:2610,update,update,2610,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2186#issuecomment-1631503788,1,['update'],['update']

I'll admit I've not kept up as much with the 5.0 changes as I should have, but I'm happy either way; I can definitely see the benefit to targeting 5.0 and keeping code maintenance down, or to getting the feature out for folks to use sooner at the cost of more development work. > * I'd like to think about removing `Seq` and `Par` and replacing them with some simple rules for sequences, strings and numbers. Honestly, agreed; I tried a few different designs to try and get rid of those two classes, but they all felt a bit awkward and special-cased. Happy to revise, though, to lower the barrier to using the new feature. > This would match, e.g., `qutip.ket(""01"")` and `qutip.basis([2, 2], [0, 1])`. `Seq` and `Par` do however make it really clear that in one case measurements follow each other on the same subspaces and in the other they are performed simultaneously on different subspaces, so I'm not quite sure. Maybe there is some middle ground. My initial thought was to do something like use tuples instead of `Seq` and lists instead of `Par`, but that then ran into a couple issues.

Deployability,"> As I understand it, the only way to avoid needing to touch `MANIFEST.in` is to not have files distributed with the test suite (or to have the temporary files by `*.py`, since `setup.py` automatically recognises them).

You won't have the problem locally, because you'll be running `./setup.py develop`, which ""installs"" in-place, so you don't notice the fact that you've missed files from the manifest. In the tests, it runs `./setup.py install`, which does the copy, missing files which aren't in the manifest.; > ; > Boxi: I'm not certain what more you'd like to do with fixtures here.

Deployability,"> Assuming Simon's point isn't just a complete answer to your question: in the general case, this is an impossible question to answer - it touches on many parts of numerical integration, such as tolerance limits and adaptive step-size methods. When you're dealing with completely arbitrary time-dependence, there's not really any one-size-fits-all approach that'll work (despite how RK45 is often taught as a magic bullet in physics courses).; > ; > Here, you will likely find that your RK45 results depend strongly on how many intermediate timesteps you use, whereas QuTiP's results will be (marginally) more stable. This is because QuTiP will internally subdivide the timesteps more to achieve internal precision goals, but then only returns the results at the time points you ask for. You can increase the maximum number of allowed subdivisions by increasing the `nsteps` parameter in a `qutip.Options` object, and with the `options` keyword argument. I addressed Simon's question. Also, I tried different solver options in mesolve including solver type, nsteps, relative and absolute tolerence, etc ... Also for RK45 I tried to change the parameters in order to see if the solutions coincide. They didn't. I don't know if there exists an analytically solvable problem in which both Hamiltonian and dissipation operators are time dependent, but if there is such a problem, then I can use it as a benchmark in order to compare QuTiP and RK45.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986665248:174,integrat,integration,174,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986665248,1,['integrat'],['integration']

If so, how? conda / source / pip? Consider doing it via conda if you are interested in the stable version release (4.3), by activating the conda-forge channel as detailed in the documentation.

Deployability,"> I suspect the method of using QobjEvo that was suggested above only use two time steps (initial and final time) in evolving the Hamiltonian as the seed and interpolate the Hamiltonian at the time between the initial and final time using some interpolation function. This is not the case. The answer to your question is to use `QobjEvo` as suggested. For example, here is a simple example using a fast-oscillating array function in a `QobjEvo` and a much shorter `tlist` in `mesolve`. You may need to set the solver options `nsteps`, `atol` and `rtol` to suitable values, as I have done here. ```python; import qutip; import numpy as np. fast_ts = np.linspace(0, 1, 1001); fast_xs = 2.9e3*np.pi * np.cos(2*np.pi * 2.91e2 * fast_ts); # This is the behaviour you were suggesting is happening.; bad_interpolation_xs = np.array([fast_xs[0], fast_xs[-1]]). H = qutip.QobjEvo([[qutip.sigmax(), fast_xs]], tlist=fast_ts); H_bad = [[qutip.sigmax(), bad_interpolation_xs]]; rho = qutip.basis(2, 0).proj(); times = np.array([0., 1]); e_ops = [qutip.sigmay()]; options = qutip.Options(nsteps=10_000_000, atol=1e-14, rtol=1e-12). two_times = qutip.mesolve(H, rho, times, e_ops=e_ops, options=options); many_times = qutip.mesolve(H, rho, fast_ts, e_ops=e_ops, options=options); bad_times = qutip.mesolve(H_bad, rho, times, e_ops=e_ops, options=options). assert len(two_times.expect[0]) == 2; assert len(many_times.expect[0]) == 1001. print(two_times.expect[0][-1]) # -0.59736575; print(many_times.expect[0][-1]) # -0.59736575; print(bad_times.expect[0][-1]) # -4.5466086e-08; ```. You can see that I was able to do a successful integration with only 2 times in `mesolve`, but many in a fast-oscillating Hamiltonian. Clearly the `bad_times` version (which only has the start and end points so misses all the fast oscillation behaviour) is completely different to the other two versions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1472#issuecomment-810246525:1616,integrat,integration,1616,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1472#issuecomment-810246525,1,['integrat'],['integration']

With it's size, it's probably not ideal as a Dense, but I don't think we should raise an error for other type... It doesn't actually restrict the RHS to CSR -- it only *constructs* the RHS as a CSR initially. The base solver will convert the RHS to the correct format for the integrator if needed. It might be possible one day to avoid constructing the RHS as a CSR but it might be tricky to make it not horribly slow, so I'd like to leave this as potential enhancement rather than work on it right now. > There is no `heomsolve` to go with `HEOMSolver`.

Deployability,"> Users who makes their own SolverOptions are the base case. Using the `??solve` function with an `Options` instance and with documentation for the options items in the `Options` class, is the way in v4 and will probably stay that way for a while. Having a options not knowing about the solver let it accept bad options and typos. Also it hides the options documentation: solver's options could be in the `??solve` function, but not integrator options. The integrator was merged into the solver in v4 and is not made to be used directly by the average user. So the user should not need to know they exist to use qutip, nor refer to them directly to see which options are supported. I'm not sure I am quite following, but my thought was that options would be checked by the solver class when they are passed in. The mechanism the solver class would use for doing the check, would be to pass the description of the allowed options to the SolverOptions class, along with the options themselves. > Not sure I understand why this would be convenient, flat seems a easier to use and less confusing. Ideally the user should not need to know that there are 2 levels of options. The reason for nesting the ode options a little, is to make it clear which options might change if the ODE method changes. If one hides the structure completely, there is nothing to guide the user as to which options are related to what. E.g. If ODE method ""A"" took option ""opt1"" and method ""B"" took ""opt2"" then it's much clearer what is happening if one has to pass `""ode"": {""method"": ""A"", ""opt1"": 1}` and `""ode"": {""method"": ""B""}` than `""method"": ""A"", ""opt1"": 1"" and `""method"": ""B"", ""opt2"": 2`. In the flat case, one might accidentally have `""method"": ""B"": ""opt1"": 1` and ""opt1"" would be ignored. I am not too hung up on the exact approach for this bit though -- I just want it to be clear to the user what is going wrong, and for it to be a little be hard to options for different ODE methods clash with each other or other solve",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1947#issuecomment-1174214647:433,integrat,integrator,433,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1947#issuecomment-1174214647,2,['integrat'],['integrator']

Deployability,"@AFvanloo Could you explain a little more what you are doing? The error appears to have been generated by an attempt to recompile `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs` without openmp installed, which is unlikely to have happened unless something is attempting to rebuild every cython or cpp file and ignoring qutip's `setup.py`.

Deployability,"@AFvanloo My wild guess about what has happened is:. 1. You modified QuTiP's source files.; 2. When the files are modified, the `reload` functionality you are using attempts to recompile the Cython files in a strange way. There is nothing wrong with modifying QuTiP, but I would suggest first trying to compile an unmodified QuTiP in the ordinary way -- e.g. by following https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html#installing-from-source. Then, once that is working, you can modify the source code and recompile in the same way. I'm going to close this issue for now since it doesn't seem like a bug, but please feel free to keep asking questions in this issue or on the mailing list.

Deployability,"@Ericgig @hodgestar, Eric and Simon: unless there's anything else that springs to mind, I'll pencil in the 4.6 release for later this week/weekend after this is merged to `master`?. Simon in particular: there's a couple of accessible places in `correlation` that make deprecated `ode2es` calls. That particular functionality of the solvers isn't being removed in 5.0 (though maybe it should - `mesolve` is faster and better in almost every way), so they aren't themselves deprecated. Right now they don't trigger `DeprecationWarning` popups if a user calls them (since the stacklevel is 2). Despite that, should I _also_ wrap them in a warning filter to catch it? I don't really know best practices here. I kept postponing doing the 4.6 release because I'd keep thinking of little bits and bobs that I thought should go in, but at this point Boxi's (@BoxiLi) new pulse scheduler stuff is in and ready, the packaging and distribution methods are updated, and we'll have issued deprecation warnings for the things that we know are being removed. Anything beyond this can start to form the basis of a 4.7 release in a few months' time, with the Floquet changes (they might be waiting on me at the moment) and possibly some new stuff out of GSoC. Possibly that'll also include some deprecation warnings and other bits and bobs to do with packages getting moved out of qutip/qutip, and the changes to how the data-layer is going to work.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1480#issuecomment-814937234:111,release,release,111,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1480#issuecomment-814937234,4,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'updated']"

Deployability,"@Ericgig Do you have examples of where integrators are used?. Some of the interface choices seem inconsistent -- e.g. `system` is a `QobjEvo` instance (so it has dims) but the states are `data` (which don't have dims, type, etc). Perhaps this makes sense given how things are used, but it would be good to be consistent (especially given that accessing `.data` is very fast and would allow the integrator access to the dims and various high-level operations). Perhaps one solution is to have two levels of interface -- i.e. a low-level one (`get_state`, `set_state`, `integrate`) and a high-level one (`run`) where the signature of `run` changes to `run(initial_qobj, tlist) -> final_qobj` and `run` calls `get_state`, `set_state` and `integrate`?.

Deployability,"@HarshBabla99 I'm guessing based on the error message that you are running QuTiP on Windows. Do you have a C compiler installed? The compiler is needed to compile the strings. The Windows installation instructions are outlined at https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html#installation-on-windows. I would recommend installing everything using conda if you can (see higher up on the install documentation page). If the compiler is installed, perhaps it is an issue with the compiler not being present in the `PATH`. Either way, this appears to be not an issue with QuTiP itself, but let's keep this issue open for a bit so that we can help you resolve things as best we can.

Deployability,@ajgpitch @nonhermitian In ProjectQ they have an install option which lets you use the library without the C++ simulator by specifying the parameter `--without-cppsimulator` during a `python setup.py install` [Link](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ). We can try something like that if you want a version of qutip which can run even without a working compiler. [Here](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/master/setup.py#L132) is their `setup.py` file with the conditional compilation.

Deployability,"@ajgpitch, I think that instance method picking is still somewhat of an issue in python 3, (which is what I use primarily) although I could be wrong. Either way, since the current QuTiP version supports 2.7, we would need to make this backward compatible to do multiprocessing correctly, so I'm glad you agree that option 3 is best. As to dropping python2 support, I think that this would be a good idea for v5.0, since [python is dropping support for 2.7 in two years](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/), which could be close to the time that QuTiP v5 is released (depending on how long the changes take). @sahmed95, thanks for making those final changes - sorry, I had forgotten to make the docstring capitalization changes.

Deployability,"@cgranade I'm really liking the overall look of the Instrument class -- it's a much easier way to deal with measurements than calling the measurement operations all the time & of combine measurement operations with other operations on Qobjs. I'm keen to hear feedback from others too, but in the mean time I'm going to note some thoughts here for when I come back to this:. * It would be good to think about how all the operations on Qobj match up with QuTiP version 5 (since this draft is based on v4 currently).; * I'd like to think about removing `Seq` and `Par` and replacing them with some simple rules for sequences, strings and numbers. This would match, e.g., `qutip.ket(""01"")` and `qutip.basis([2, 2], [0, 1])`. `Seq` and `Par` do however make it really clear that in one case measurements follow each other on the same subspaces and in the other they are performed simultaneously on different subspaces, so I'm not quite sure. Maybe there is some middle ground.; * In QuTiP it's more normal to have the helper constructors not on the class as classmethods. I do like secondary constructors as classmethods, but I think in cases like this where there are essentially an infinite number of possible constructors, it makes sense to not ""bless"" any of them by sticking them on the class.; * It would be good to have one really nice use case that we could turn into a guide entry in the documentation. The current small examples are great, but it would be good to add one slightly bigger worked example that did something more ""exciting"".; * I would not push everything into the `qutip` namespace (largely because we would likely not want that in v5, although I should actually check what v5 is doing in `qutip.__init__` these days).; * We should decide whether to target QuTiP 4.7 or 4.7 and 5 for this. Target just v5 means not having to worry about making it nice in both, but will mean it'll be a bit more of a delay before release).

Deployability,"@goerz I think one of Mølmer's papers (maybe the one I have pointed out) addressed the equivalence of the two methods. Sorry, I don't have a definite paper to point out at this moment. I was actually organizing the Julia community to work on this direction (see [JuliaQuantum](http://juliaquantum.github.io)) from scratch, and hence didn't follow up the efforts in the measurement simulation within QuTiP. . When I was writing my paper on continuous measurement ([PRA, 93.023817](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.023817)), I came up the argument that the former method may be more appropriate for measurement models. This is because measurements have to happen in evenly spaced time steps determined by the detector's integrating time, so it is intuitive to use a random number to judge if on each measurement step the quantum jump will happen. There may be a way to use the second method to implement the same measurement simulation model, but I didn't think too much on it. In reality, I developed another more efficient method without actually evolving the density operator in my paper to simulate continuous measurement using a set of stochastic equations for squeezing thousands of atoms' state which has not been included in QuTiP yet. Sorry I don't have more useful reference that explains this point in more details at this moment.

Deployability,"@hodgestar okay so I figured out some code. It's VERY close to getting the max frequency, but it's not perfect. .

Basically what I'm doing is executing a bunch of `add` instructions through inline assembly multiple times (which will take it's sweet time based on CPU cycles), measuring the time it takes to finish, and doing some fun maths.

I'm not sure which is more desirable for us - overall I think the time loss from installing `cvxpy` isn't _that_ high, and we'd get more improvement from redoing some of our older tests.

Deployability,"@maij The code is looking good to me. I've requested some changes and after that I'd like to do a final review, but I think we're in good shape. My thoughts on the remaining questions:. > Decide if the spin_wigner function should return only real values be default (as is currently done for the spin_q_function). I'm +1 on returning real values since the Wigner function is real valued and this is more consistent (unless you're aware of any strange cases where it might somehow not be?). > Decide whether to integrate the W function normalization in _rho_kq rather than at the top level. We divide all terms by (2*j + 1) only to end up multiplying it back out at the end which is a waste of time (_rho_kq is called d**2 times, d=2*j+1) . The benefit of leaving it as-is is that it reads like most definitions in literature. I'm +1 on sticking to the definitions in literature unless there is a measured speed penalty. `2*j + 1` likely can't be that big and the small number of arithmetic operations required is probably dwarfed by the matrix multiplications happening. . > Decide if normalization factor for Wigner and spin Q function should be included (Davis et al. suggest the normalization factor is only introduced during integration: Eq 14 https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10167).

Deployability,"@pmenczel I've worked on this quite a bit, mostly focusing on putting initial tests in place, supporting the full set of coefficient functions supported by the other solvers for the rates, shifting the martingale calculations into the integrator and moving the rate shift calculations to Cython to avoid the overhead of Python function calls and loops. @Ericgig I ended up doing some odd things because QobjEvo doesn't seem like natural fit for these rate functions and coefficients are a bit awkward to use directly inside solvers. @pmenczel & @Ericgig Could you take a look at everything again and let me know what you think?. Some of the bigger todo items I have in mind at the moment:. - How do we tell that the negative rate case is really working correctly? I added a test but it doesn't match mesolve well and I'm unhappy with that.; - Can we strengthen any of the existing tests with more assertions?; - Now that the discrete and continuous martingale calculations are mostly handled when collapses happen, we could expose them on the result along with `col_which` and `col_time`. Should we?; - Are the new martingale and rate shift calculations correct?; - The way the shared coefficients are used inside `RateSet` and exposed to `MCSolve` required a lot of careful thinking, did I get the design of that right?; - How do we test whether this works when using `parallel_map`? Being able to run in parallel is a key strength of the Monte Carlo method, so it would be good to have tests that show that that works.; - Can we drop the number of trajectories in the docs to make the doc build faster?; - Using the SciPy integrator is a bit awkward. Is there anything we can replace it with? If not, should we expose more of its options? I exposed the `limit` option because I kept having the integration fail during testing.; - Add tests for the `nm_mcsolve` Cython classes.

Deployability,"Ah, nice catch thanks, and thanks for the super clear repro. We're overhauling the solvers for QuTiP 5.0, which will include a lot more rigorous input checking on entry, but also it uses far safer low-level datatypes that would catch this shape mismatch in the C layer (even though the `dims` _should_ have been checked by `mesolve`). I'll check the other solvers and patch in a sanity test - probably after these lines: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d5e305513d9186df74beee4fd8da680e89f29d15/qutip/mesolve.py#L259-L261; we can just insert a test; ```python; if rho0.dims[0] != rho0.dims[1]:; raise ValueError(; ""input state must be a pure state or square density matrix""; ); ```. There may also be other segfaults lurking if you use a Python function to generate a time-dependent `Qobj` value in the Liouvillian or the expectation operators, but right now you're unlikely to use that form (because it's slow as anything). The bug slips through because we unsafely pass off a matrix down to C code (where we currently don't have sanity checks) without first verifying that it is a valid shape in Python space - the C code is working as designed, so there shouldn't be problems with correct inputs. Removing `c_ops` causes `mesolve` to delegate to `sesolve` which presumably is better at its type-checking, and I expect that a small dimension size working is likely just `malloc` having slack in the memory it gives us for small sizes or small requests being allocated into the special pre-allocated store.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169:368,patch,patch,368,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"As I understand it, the only way to avoid needing to touch `MANIFEST.in` is to not have files distributed with the test suite (or to have the temporary files by `*.py`, since `setup.py` automatically recognises them). That's not really a pytest thing, it's a `setuptools` one. I don't think there's a problem distributing files as part of the tests. You can add a line which says; ```; recursive-include qutip/tests/qasm_files *.qasm; ```; to `MANIFEST.in`, and that should hopefully fix the problem. You won't have the problem locally, because you'll be running `./setup.py develop`, which ""installs"" in-place, so you don't notice the fact that you've missed files from the manifest. In the tests, it runs `./setup.py install`, which does the copy, missing files which aren't in the manifest. Boxi: I'm not certain what more you'd like to do with fixtures here. Fixtures are good for setup and tear down, parametrisation and sharing resources (like network connections), but I'm not certain what further benefit you get for a test function which is testing whether it can open a known file, read it, and construct the expected output. I think Sidhant is already doing some nice parametrisation of his tests, from what I see. Sidhant: I added a comment on the exception test, since pytest gives us an easier-to-read context manager you can use. It's also typically better practice to handle file paths like I did in that (using the overloaded `/` operator with `pathlib.Path`, or `os.path.join`) rather than manually putting in slashes. Windows _usually_ will do the right thing now with slashes, but it's better to let Python handle it for us.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156:592,install,installs,592,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156,2,['install'],"['install', 'installs']"

Then I install cython and mingwpy and run tests again:; 320 tests 2371s; 7 skip, 10 errors, 1 fail. I think the time dependent string format tests fail. Not sure, and will not investigate further at the moment. Would only make if they also fail in GitHub version, for which I have not tested on Windows. At no point do the extensions in qutip/cy get built again. So I think it is not necessary to pyximport.install in the **init**.py; I think we should change the message to a warning, like we have for matplotlib, to say something like 'no Cython, string type time-dependent solvers will not run'. It seems to make sense to allow people to install and use parts of the library even if they can't get a C compiler working for them. I don't understand why some tests do not run without cython.

Deployability,"Assuming Simon's point isn't just a complete answer to your question: in the general case, this is an impossible question to answer - it touches on many parts of numerical integration, such as tolerance limits and adaptive step-size methods. When you're dealing with completely arbitrary time-dependence, there's not really any one-size-fits-all approach that'll work (despite how RK45 is often taught as a magic bullet in physics courses). Here, you will likely find that your RK45 results depend strongly on how many intermediate timesteps you use, whereas QuTiP's results will be (marginally) more stable. This is because QuTiP will internally subdivide the timesteps more to achieve internal precision goals, but then only returns the results at the time points you ask for. You can increase the maximum number of allowed subdivisions by increasing the `nsteps` parameter in a `qutip.Options` object, and with the `options` keyword argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136:172,integrat,integration,172,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Deployability,"Assuming you have Anaconda 2.5 installed (so that you can use the Intel MKL on all platforms), the default number of threads is one. Therefore, you don't get much benefit. To change the number of threads used you can do:. ``` python; import mkl; mkl.set_num_threads(N); ```. or in QuTiP it is easy to set using:. ``` python; n_threads = hardware_info()['cpus']; mkl.set_num_threads(n_threads); ```. One can not access the spare MKL routines directly as there is no support in the scipy.sparse library. However, you can get to all of the functions using ctypes. An example of complex SpMV is here:. https://gist.github.com/nonhermitian/74c3ddbbd006b2f8d306. The only issue with the attached method, is that finding the MKL runtime library is platform dependent (maybe should file an issue with the Anaconda people?). Therefore, it is a bit cumbersome to work with. Moreover, it is not possible to access these routines via Cython as they do not have any of the development stuff available. That may not really be an issue at the end of the day though as one needs quite a large system to get any benefit, and at large Hilbert dimensions, the overhead from calling Python funcs. directly is not an issue. I will be chatting with the [Intel Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/python-distribution) people tomorrow to give them some suggestions and talk about our project.

Deployability,"Bumping an old topic with two major new considerations. Number one: Travis is [changing its pricing model for open source software](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing), and generally it seems like [it's going to become unfeasible for us](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works). Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in. In around March 2021 we expect the old travis-ci.org that QuTiP is grandfathered onto to shut down completely, forcing us onto the new model on travis-ci.com. Number two: in November 2019, GitHub released their own CI, GitHub Actions. This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers. This completely free period of GitHub Actions might not last forever (you can imagine maybe they're just trying to drive adoption before increasing the cost), but especially with the new time pressure from Travis, this seems like the right choice for now. Our testing set up is fairly straightforward, so migrating to a new CI shouldn't be too difficult. I just wrote (#1429) a GitHub Actions workflow to build and distribute binary releases of QuTiP on Linux/Mac/Windows, and I'm pretty convinced by the power of their CI. It's got an awful lot of flexibility with a _lot_ of customisation so its initial learning curve is a little steep (or maybe I'm just not used to CI tools), but I'm impressed by what's available. I believe it comes with a degree of reusability as well; I think we can define a test as a single ""action"", and then reuse that in the PR-push workflow and the make-distribution workflow.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542:855,release,released,855,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542,2,['release'],"['released', 'releases']"

Deployability,"Congratulations, you have rediscovered the quantum Zeno effect :-) There is nothing wrong with qutip here, I think. You don't write what your system is exactly, but I assume something like $H=\sigma_x$ and jump operator $\sigma_-$. The effect of the environment can be thought of as measuring the system continuously, with a strength proportional to the coupling rate, which you call jump rate. Jump rate is indeed a slightly misleading (but commonly used) name. Its meaning is the reciprocal of the expected time until a jump, if the system is in the excited state. However, due to the continuous measurement and the quantum Zeno effect, the system rarely makes it to the excited state in the first place. Mathematically, where it comes from is that the deterministic trajectory evolution (between the jumps) is given not by the system Hamiltonian, but by an effective (non hermitian) Hamiltonian. In the limit of large coupling rates, this effective Hamiltonian becomes approximately diagonal.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2539#issuecomment-2398136920:304,continuous,continuously,304,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2539#issuecomment-2398136920,2,['continuous'],"['continuous', 'continuously']"

I can't reproduce the error unless `pyximport.install()` has already been run before QuTiP is imported (e.g. if I do `import pyximport; pyximport.install(); import qutip` or `importlib.reload(qutip)`). We have `qutip/__init__.py` organised so that we don't enable `pyximport` until after we've done the test for `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs`: first we do. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/8e181cc44ceefc14ad0e4f4bcf78e1c8fcd2b291/qutip/__init__.py#L100-L105. and only after that do we. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/8e181cc44ceefc14ad0e4f4bcf78e1c8fcd2b291/qutip/__init__.py#L124-L126. In your error it's trying to build `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs`, and the only line that ever attempts to import that (in Python space) is line 101 above in `__init__`. It can only attempt to Cythonize files if `pyximport` is activated, but `qutip` doesn't activate that til a few lines later. It's certainly still a bug that this error appears if you've manually activated `pyximport` before (which would definitely cause it), but I'm struggling to find any other reason that the error could appear.

Deployability,"For clarity: I ran your code with 1,000 timesteps and 10,000 timesteps and found a linalg norm difference in the outputs of 4.4e-4 (compared to QuTiP's 6.5e-8), which is what I meant. I considered that difference ""not fully convergent"" in part because QuTiP's default tolerance goals have an absolute tolerance of ~1e-8 (that's per-element, not the full norm). Here's a couple more things to look at:; - if you're using QuTiP objects without our solvers like this, we tidy up sparse matrices at every operation. You probably don't want that - you might get different results if you convert your RK method to work on raw Numpy arrays.; - your RHS isn't accurate - it takes `sqrt(gamma)`, but your time-dependent function already does that. This is perhaps a mistake, and very likely the source of the discrepancy? Also, while it's irrelevant here, your Lindbladian has `c_op * c_op.dag() * rho` as the last term, but it should be `c_op.dag() * c_op * rho`.; - your RK method isn't using updated versions of the Hamiltonian or the collapse operator at the intermediate timesteps.; - you say you're using RK45, but you've only got 4 different evaluations? That looks like an RK4 method to me (not that it should matter).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986723762:986,update,updated,986,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986723762,1,['update'],['updated']

The casting itself cause issues with tensorflow. The `isherm_jax` could be set to always return `False`, but returning `False` only inside jitted function is too hacky and could break with jax release. When applied everywhere, it will have strange side effect such as `qeye(n) *2` is hermitian but `qeye(n)+qeye(n)` is not. Don't want that. If the `Qobj` are always the inputs of the function, then we could probably compute the hermiticity in `qobj_tree_flatten`, but it would not be any help when the object is build inside the function.

Deployability,"For people finding this later, this is not just because of the macOS version, but also because of your _Xcode_ version. As Xcode increases, Apple are making it harder and harder to have a sensible dev environment for command-line tools when all you care about is building for your local machine. You may find that a system include like `_ctermid.h` is missing in the future - it won't always be `limits.h` - especially with Xcode 11+. Since M1 Macs (I assume - I don't have one) ship entirely with Xcode 12, they will likely need this too. I believe even `xcode-select --install` will not always reinstate `/usr/include` any more, and the `*_headers_*.pkg` seems to not work with Xcode 11. `/usr/include` is gone, but Xcode has the correct set of includes for all platforms, so you can set your compiler's `sysroot` to the relevant SDK directory to get correct lookups. By default, the one you want will be at; ```; /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MaxOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk; ```; The system `clang` will likely find this correctly, but if not or if you're using a separate compiler, for either `gcc` or `clang` you should pass the flag; ```bash; gcc -isysroot '/path/to/sdk' ...; ```; to find the correct includes. To automate this procedure, you may want to add that flag to your `CFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables.

Deployability,"Having `Qobj * matrix` work at the moment is to make it easier to transition to the 5.x branch when it releases, since it's the current behaviour of 4.x. Once we've had a bit of time for people to make the transition, I think we should be completely removing this ""functionality"". To me, matrices aren't quantum objects; if you're working with a Numpy array, you should expect Numpy semantics to occur, i.e. Numpy should see `Qobj` as a scalar type, and broadcast against it like that. It's an implementation detail that the backing data is a matrix; the linear algebra theory certainly doesn't demand it. Raising-and-catching is slower than just having the `mul` functions return `NotImplemented`. The only implementations that would need a wrapper are our Cython-based ones, and they can both be wrapped in something like; ```python; class only_allow_numeric:; def __init__(self, inner):; self.inner = inner; def __call__(self, other):; if not isinstance(other, numbers.Number):; return NotImplemented; return self.inner(complex(other)); ; mul.add_specialisations([; (CSR, CSR, only_allow_numeric(mul_csr)),; (Dense, Dense, only_allow_numeric(mul_dense)),; ]); ```.

Deployability,"Hi - I think I might have a solution for this issue in #1927. Setting up the utility was pretty straightforward, but I am not sure on how best to shape the process around using it. There are two issues that I foresee:; - Generating a news fragment when making a PR:; In order to reference PRs in the changelog, you have to pass the PR number to ; `towncrier create <PR number>.<change type>` ; So the process would be:; 1. Make draft PR; 2. Get PR number; 3. run towncrier create with PR number and commit & push resulting news fragment to PR; 4. Mark PR as ready. A way around this extra step is to reference the issue number, but you may not want that.; - When generating changelogs for releases, towncrier needs to be passed the version number in one of three ways (from the documentation):; - For Python 2/3 compatible projects, a __version__ in the top level package. This can be either a string literal, a tuple, or an [Incremental](https://github.com/hawkowl/incremental) version.; - Manually passing --version=<myversionhere> when interacting with towncrier.; - Defining a version option in a configuration file; Since there's no __version__ string or configuration file, I guess we would use the second option when calling `towncrier build`?.

Deployability,"Hi @ALasek . You are right, there is a bug in the error handling.; ```; File ""C:\Users\OlekAdmin\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\qutip\qip\circuit.py"", line 2114, in initialize; raise ValueError(""dimension of state is incorrect""); ```; This check is wrong. It assumes that the state is a qubits state. Our test didn't cover the `run` method with multi-level systems. Here are the ways around:; - If you know how to hack the package, you can simply find the file and delete this error handling (lines 2113 and 2114).; - If you don't know how to do that, you can also use; ```; gate_sequence_product(qc.propagators()); ```; to compute the unitary representation of the circuit first and then apply it to the input state. I'll make a bug fix soon. But the next release may still take a while. Using `QubitCirucuit` for qutrits and qudits should be fine, it is rarely used though.

Deployability,"Hi @Ericgig , could you be a little more specific about what reworking the kwargs treatment would entail? Also if you could emphasize more concretely what you're looking for in updates to the notebooks and docs, that would be great. I do have some other observations.; 1. I do not get the KeyError message if I run the same jupyter notebook locally with the same versions of code as specified by version_table( ). I get another error instead, which actually seems more reasonable to me (something along the lines of 'use_precond' wasn't found in the keys of the dict, which clearly indicates that there's something off with the optional args thing).; 2. Also using mech_dms = np.asarray(mech_dms) fails, I think because it sees a Qobj instead of a real number.; 3.

Deployability,"Hi @Ericgig ; Thanks for investigating this so thoroughly. ; I guess it makes sense that unpacking a dict at each call is inefficient, so I think we should drop this idea. As you have suggested previously, users can always use module variables if they wish to avoid passing vars in `args`. So I think we should aim to keep it simple. I think adding `f(t)` as a signature option will be sufficient for what @goerz wanted and would be sufficient for using a Numba jit. So, my suggestion for the next major release (v5) would be that we have only two call sigs:; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`. For now we will have to have the three (although I don't think the `rhs_with_state` is not widely used, if at all).; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`; - `f(t, state, args)`; The default needs to remain as it is, because it is widely used. I think it makes sense to use introspection to decide which has been specified by the user, as the sig is clearly distinguishable by the number of args. So effectively we can ignore the `rhs_with_state` option, but I think we should give a deprecation warning that the `f(t, state, args)` signature will be removed in the next version. So, I think this means we can keep the new method of passing the state in the args dict. I would suggest we make it a bit more simple though. I notice that the processing of the option is a bit involved. So I suggest that any element of the `args` dict where the key is of the form `name:special_value_kind` be considered some kind of special value. If `special_value_kind` is not recognised then it should throw a `ValueError`. For now we will have the `special_value_kind` of:; - `state`: Qobj of the state at time `t`, with the correct dimensions; - `state_vec`: ndarray of state as a vector; - `expect`: I can't remember exactly what you did here. The `state_vec` will clearly be much more efficient, as this is what the ODE solver maintains. However, for completeness I think we should have the `state` option.

Deployability,"Hi @Ericgig, @jakelishman,. Thanks very much for the very helpful replies! I will try these suggestions in my application Eric!. Jake, when you say the following:; > Oh of course, I had `mcsolve` in mind as to why that couldn't be done (and in that case, my interpolation wouldn't work either because of the separation of the decay channels)... Is it that, this:; ```; def L(t, args):; H = H(t, ...); c_op = C(H, t, ...); return qutip.liouvillian(H, [c_op]). mcsolve(L, ..., c_ops=[]); ```. won't work due to `_funcrhs` treating `h_func` as a Hamiltonian always? If this is the only factor (as far as I can see), then I think I can further hack this to make callbacks work for me locally. I'm not yet sure if the numpy arrays method will work here but this is what I will strive for. Some details of my plans: I am doing dynamics simulations of quantum annealing processes. We use a certain number of qubits (between 4 and 8) biased and coupled in certain ways to produce examples of 'difficult' problems for adiabatic quantum computation, where the instantaneous energy gaps can have very small minima during evolution. The resulting ODEs appear to be 'stiff' and long evolution times are required to observe high probabilities of being in the ground state. The combination of these things appears to make solving for long evolution times very time consuming. I observed a massive speedup using `mcsolve` however. What I wish to do is include various decay channels, which in the physical systems we use, we understand to be in the 'weak coupling limit' defined by T. Albash here:; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08767.pdf. Another note: A number of colleagues have found most useful the RK45 method implemented in what I understand to be 'new' ode solver scipy code `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`. I notice that the 'dopri5' option for `scipy.integrate.ode` is likely the same thing.

Deployability,"Hi @jakelishman,; Thanks for the update and your detailed comments! No worries about the time, I follow the project so see everyone is busy on implementing the fundamentals for v5. I see two main points to consider:; 1) the code will need to be rewritten to make a more consistent use of the data layer with the rest of the project.; 2) the license issue. For 1, indeed, I was not so familiar with the intended use of the data layer and using a `Dispatcher` as these are all new capabilities (mostly this was collecting together some old `einsum` code I had and packaging it together to work with `Qobj`). If we think this type of thing will indeed be useful (I personally still do given the potential speed ups), I am happy to try to implement things in the way you mention when I get the time to go through this exercise (most likely will require your input also).

Deployability,"Hi @michelinesoley,. Your bug report inspired me to dig into the `qutip.control.optimize_pulse` sparse matrix support which lead to some fixes in #1621. When you increase `N` in your example from 2 to 3, it changes the internal type used by the optimizer to represent propagators. You can also make the `N = 2` case fail by changing the last line to:. ```python; result = cpo.optimize_pulse_unitary(..., dyn_params=dict(oper_dtype=Qobj, sparse_eigen_decomp=True)); ```. Your example can be made to work for `N = 3` (albeit slowly) by changing the following lines:. ```python; mapped = Qobj(mapped, dims=[[N]*4 + [2]*4] * 2); ```; (which was a bug in the example itself -- it created a Qobj with the right shape but wrong dimensions) and the last line to . ```python; result = cpo.optimize_pulse_unitary(..., dyn_params=dict(oper_dtype=Qobj, sparse_eigen_decomp=False)); ```; For me the `N = 3` case was slower with `sparse_eigen_decomp=True`, but perhaps it will be better for your full problem. If you would like to try `sparse_eigen_decomp=True` you are welcome to try the patch in PR #1621 and I would appreciate feedback on any performance issues for larger systems. We are currently working to support bigger systems in QuTiP 5 by using the new flexible Qobj data layer (which supports both sparse and dense matrices already and will hopefully support GPU and TensorFlow matrices in the near future).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1617#issuecomment-885064386:1075,patch,patch,1075,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1617#issuecomment-885064386,1,['patch'],['patch']
Deployability,"Hi @nonhermitian, I spent some time struggling with this as I recently shifted to macOS. This problem affects other Python installations too. I found a solution to this and if you could update it in the docs instead of the default macOS installation script, then it would be very helpful for new users. I will post the solution first and explain it below. . 1. Install a manual Python version which overrides the default Python supplied by Apple in the `usr/bin/python` path. You can check this using ```which python```. Installing using brew - . ```brew install python```. 2. Change the default Python interpreter from the one supplied by macOS in `usr/bin/python` to the user installed version in `/usr/local/bin/python`. This is explained in this [post](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/09/27/use-python-effectively-on-os-x#p1). Edit the file `/etc/paths` using ```sudo vi etc/paths``` and move the line `/usr/local/bin` to the top. This makes the user installed Python default and the packages installed by pip or brew are imported instead of the ones supplied by apple. Restart the terminal. You may need to update numpy and scipy using ```pip install numpy``` or ```pip install numpy -U```. 3. Install qutip using ```python setup.py install```. Apple has its own Python version and a few modules such as numpy and scipy come along with it which are at `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7`. These modules are difficult to manage and update due to issues with permission. Hence, even if you update numpy or scipy using `pip` or `brew`, it is not detected by Python. ~~This also raises an issue later `error: could not create 'build/src.macosx-10.12-x86_64-2.7': Permission denied`~~. This solution seems better since it does not mess with the system default. Edit 1 : sudo -H is needed to install using ```sudo -H python setup.py install```. The -H tag sets the home directory as the default for installing configuration files.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/348#issuecomment-263745214:123,install,installations,123,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/348#issuecomment-263745214,20,"['Install', 'configurat', 'install', 'update']","['Install', 'Installing', 'configuration', 'install', 'installation', 'installations', 'installed', 'installing', 'update']"

Deployability,"Hi Arne. Thanks for the bug report. Yes, you're right, it is the change in default value of the average_states (used to be called mc_avg) that is the course of the failing tests. And it could break backwards compatibility so perhaps it should be reverted. However, if average_states defaults to True it breaks backwards compatibility with the stochastic master equation solvers (which did not use this flag before, and had a different default behavior). However, since the stochastic ME and SE solvers has not yet been an official part of the qutip API in a release, perhaps priority should be to keep the mcsolve backward compatible (although I think it makes more sense not to take an average over the trajectories by default).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/37#issuecomment-22224680:558,release,release,558,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/37#issuecomment-22224680,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi Kevin. Thanks for your efforts on this. However, I am not in favor of merging this PR in this form. It is way too intrusive on the old API, it would break backwarks compatibility for no good reason as I see it. Personally I don't think that the _2t and _1t names are that confusing. As you point out, _1t is still a two-time correlation function (a one-time correlation function would not be a correlation function, just a simple expectation value), but the _1t and _2t is intended to refer to the number of free time variables. Perhaps this should be explained more clearly in the docstrings, but I don't think it is worth changing the API for this reason. I would prefer if you added the new mc solvers using the current API conventions, and preferably without changing the me and es based solvers. If you want to propose a new API the correct way to do it would be:; 1. First discuss the idea, so that everyone interested could weight in on the naming of the functions, the style of parameters and arguments etc.; 2. Implement the new API without disrupting the previous API; 3. Deprecate the previous API, so that using it gives a warning (but still works!). ; 4. Then finally after a few release cycles we may drop the old API. This would not happen until qutip 4.0 (see http://semver.org/), which we do not plan to release anytime soon.

I can also send you the markdown source code per email like this, but I’m not sure if it works as I expected. The following is the markdown source code:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate.

Deployability,"Hi Vutshi. Thanks a lot for this contribution! It's looking very interesting indeed. I'll be looking into the details of your code, notebook and your paper in the coming days, but from a first look it's looking great! I've been working a lot on the stochastic solvers the last few months, but it is still very much under development. The milstein method has been on my todo list for a long time, but I've not gotten around to work on it yet, so your contribution is very timely and most welcome!. I have tried to design the API in the most general way I could think of while still keeping the complexity from growing too much. Defining an SME with its RHS function, D1 and D2 functions has worked for most problems I considered so far, but I'd be happy to discuss further if this could be changed to something more flexible, like a function for calculating rho_{n+1} like you suggest. We hope to have the stochastic solver API ready and mature enough to include in the next qutip release sometime this fall, so it would be good to have these things tested and thoroughly discussed before then. But until the stochastic module is officially in the QuTiP API we still have a lot of freedom to shake things up if necessary. Also, to keep complexity and code duplication down I wanted to follow the pattern. smesolve (choose solver by argument) -> smesolve_generic -> specific method and SDE by rhs, d1, d2 selection. So it would be good if smesolve_mil and smesolve_impl in your code could be combined with smesolve, and if smesolve_implicit and smesolve_milstein could be combined with smesolve_generic, etc. That would reduce a lot of code duplication I think. Of course, if smesolve_generic needs to be changed to accommodate this that would be totally fine with me. It would be great if you could do a pull request of this to the qutip master, then we could discuss details in the PR.

Deployability,"Hi, thank you very much for the quick responses and linking the other issues. . > But your making sparse matrices dense. Yes, I agree. But I was trying to just work out a simple problem which looks like. `dp[n]/dt = spre(Q)*p[n-1] + spost(Q)*p[n+1]. where p is a list of flattened density matrices. I understand that a better version of this would be to completely flatten p and write the RHS as a large `L` as Alex points out and then use `cy_ode_rhs`. But here is the issue, in the HEOM case, building `L` runs out of memory if we consider a large size for the set of auxiliary density matrices `p`. As such, I cannot completely build the `L` for the cases I am looking into. The approach that I was trying to take was to keep building the p's as we integrate. In this case, each RHS computation is a small dense matrix-vector computation and I can choose to keep or discard it depending on the max value of its elements. This gives the flexibility to truncate how many auxiliary density matrices I keep. The motivation is that in some papers on the Heom method, there is a dynamic filtering of the auxiliary matrices and it has been shown that with just a few 100s of auxiliary matrices, you can get a reasonable result. But the way we have the code in QuTiP now pre-computes the `L` and gets stuck due to memory limitations. @agpitch Thanks for the suggestions. I am trying to make the HEOM work without building the `L`. Perhaps I will still run into memory issues if I try to initialize the full set of `p` but if the dynamic filtering approach works out, then I can escape the memory problem by only building a few of the `p`'s and deciding to append them or not based on some conditions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/831#issuecomment-368980965:752,integrat,integrate,752,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/831#issuecomment-368980965,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

This is the OpenCL implementation I would recommend in absence of a GPU. But this script circumvents the license agreement and I am not sure whether this is legal.

Deployability,"I also note that I'm not replying to the thread I thought I was - I thought I was in `krotov`! For my response to the discussion points:; - I think the function `qutip.mesolve` shouldn't change interface at all for 5.0 - we can change its backend, but I think it'll be a huge hindrance to adoption of 5.0 if we make major breaking changes to effectively our premier function, and I don't see a need to do that. We can add, rather than change, and keep `mesolve` as the ""quick-and-dirty"" method that just works.; - I'm in favour of exposing the different parts of the `mesolve` process as user-accessible, composable chunks. So something like exposing a `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` function, where `OdeState` has properties `rhs: QobjEvo`, `state: Qobj`, `time: float` (`sesolve_prepare_ode` and `mcsolve_prepare_ode` would presumably return the same object, or a derived object). Then we'd have an `Integrator` class, which encapsulates an integration step using whatever integrator of choice, so there's one that encapsulates the scipy integrator, one which is a Cython-ised RK4 implementation, etc. Then the low-level user would simply write the `for time in times` loop themselves; at this level, there's nothing fancy that QuTiP adds, so we may as well just expose it directly.

Deployability,"I am not using mpiexec when running the tests. I have done some more experimenting on my local machine. 1. If I install `mpi4py` with pip, I get the same problem on my machine (the test hangs, I can't even CTRL+C). The steps I have taken in detail are:; ```bash; conda create -n qutip-test-tmp python numpy scipy pytest; conda activate qutip-test-tmp; sudo apt install mpich libmpich-dev; pip install 'qutip[full] @ git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip.git@refs/pull/2296/head'; cd ~/miniconda3/envs/qutip-test-tmp/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qutip/tests/; pytest --verbose --pyargs qutip.tests.solver.test_parallel; ```; (The `apt install` call is taken from the `mpi4py/setup-mpi` and without it, the installation fails. I `apt remove`d the packages again afterwards.). 2. Then I tried installing with conda as follows.; ```bash; conda create -n qutip-test2-tmp python numpy scipy pytest mpi4py; conda activate qutip-test2-tmp; pip install 'qutip[full] @ git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip.git@refs/pull/2296/head'; cd ~/miniconda3/envs/qutip-test2-tmp/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qutip/tests/; pytest --verbose --pyargs qutip.tests.solver.test_parallel; ```; Now things get even weirder. Here, `test_map` and `test_map_accumulator` pass, but `test_map_pass_error` hangs (I can get out with CTRL+C). 3. In my regular development environment, all tests pass without problem. I have no idea what the difference is between my regular environment and the one created in number 2. I will continue trying things out when I have time. In the end, I imagine the solution might be not to include `mpi4py` in the `extras` section, and only add it with conda in one or two test runs?.

Deployability,"I am ultimately interested both in open system and closed system dynamics interchangeably. > [...] In the 5.x series, almost all the intermediary operations should get a speed up as well (`Qobj.__init__` is getting its time slashed, and the line `current_liouvillian += control * operator` may be able to be replaced with one that applies the same in-place calculation optimisations that `mesolve` does internally). One thing you pay a nasty penalty for right now if that internally we'd keep column-stacking/unstacking the state, but in the 5.x branch it'll stop being represented internally by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. That's an extremely exciting prospect! I'd love to be able to have internal sparse data for Qobj's that represent Hamiltonians/Liouvillians, but dense data for Qobj's that represent Hilbert space states or Density matrices. In fact, it looks like a significant part of the overhead in the [calculation of the Krotov's pulse update](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/optimize.py#L466) is due to the stacking/unstacking, see [`profile.svg`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/raw/f3f49104083d59b9612f153d2f0ff652ea6a9f01/profile.svg) in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf#file-profile-svg). In the benchmarking notebook, for the optimization in `In [34]`, that's the extra 6 seconds per iteration (iterations 1-3 should ideally take exactly twice as long as iteration 0, as iteration 0 is a simple forward propagation and all later iterations are one forward and one backward propagations). That's what we have in our Fortran implementation, too: the runtime of the optimization is basically just the runtime of all the internal propagations; calculating the updates should be completely negligible.

Deployability,"I do not think it's a _good first issue_...; There are multiple possible solutions and it is not clear which is the best one:. 1. Ensure all eigen values and eigen vectors are computed.; 1.1 This could be done by finding an alternative to scipy to solve for sparse matrix decomposition, but it would add extra requirement and it must be easy to install with pip.; 1.2 Use a third call to `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs`/ `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh` using `sigma` to find all the pseudo degenerate values. It need to be done while being careful about special cases. This would make the sparse eigen solver even slower than it already is.; 2. Allow to sort by other orders, such as the complex value or magnitude. This would not solve the issue, but give some options to go around it. However the dense eigen solver would be expected to behave the same and the dense eigen solver does not have this options, so we need to implement it ourselves. This sorting option would also be required for any other data type we want to support. To go around that, the `Qobj` methods could be responsible for the sorting, the `sort` argument would only be passed to the dispatched function when `sparse=True`.; 3. Refuse to use the sparse solver for the full decomposition as scipy does. The sparse eigensolver is both slow and hard to use in this case. Also the eigen vectors computed by the sparse solver are stored in a dense array, so it is not that useful to save memory...; 4. Implement our own sparse eigen decomposition...; 5. Only document the issue without fixing. The default is the dense solver, which is both faster and safer in almost all cases.; 6. Something else...; ; I would personally go for either 1.2 of 3. ; Adding different sorting options in `Qobj` methods (2) and removing them from the dispatched functions, could be nice, but it's not a fix.

Since qutip doesn't use xvfb directly this bug won't be a problem for general CI testing, where only qutip is loaded on a cloud instance (for instance Debian testing done at https://ci.debian.net/packages/q/qutip/).

Deployability,I have found the issue. The wrapper to zvode provided by scipy does not allow for setting itask=5 in the single step mode.

As for homebrew, it doesn't seem to have many of the requirements that qutip needs, such as numpy and scipy etc. For some reason they are in a separate homebrew repository.. Without these it wouldn't make much sense to submit a qutip formula to the official homebrew repository.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/62#issuecomment-27491906:84,release,release,84,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/62#issuecomment-27491906,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"I suspect that because of pip's isolated builds, we have to specify `oldest-supported-numpy` in our `[build-system]` requirements (otherwise the isolated pip will do the wrong thing and build against the latest numpy, which might be newer than the installed numpy) but this prevents building with a different version of numpy installed. :/. **Update**: I'm not sure if the above is correct, but documentation builds are failing with `ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1735#issuecomment-989766192:248,install,installed,248,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1735#issuecomment-989766192,3,"['Update', 'install']","['Update', 'installed']"

Deployability,"I think I have found the problem and will submit a bugfix. The problem was a bug in sp_eigs: when selecting large eigenvalues the eigenvalue vectors is flip (left <-> right) but then later on still the highest (which has become the lowest) eigenvalues was extracted from the total list of eivenvalues... We should probably restructure the function sp_eigs a bit... right now it is trying to do a little bit too many things. At least it should be split into sp_eigs and dense_eigs.

Deployability,"I think it would be great to have a fast implementation of tensor contraction. However, QuTiP has moved on since this PR and I think the right way to implement this now would be to add a new specialization to the data layer for tensor contraction (maybe something like einsum) and to implement that instead (or even just to re-implement methods for the new CSR representation). @IIAOPSW If you're up for giving that a try, that would be awesome. If not, I might close this PR and we can revisit it after QuTiP v5 alpha has been released. @IIAOPSW Separately, I've read through the code the PR, but I'd still like to get a high-level summary of the algorithm you're implementing (or a reference).
