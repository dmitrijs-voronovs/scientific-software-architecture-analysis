Availability,"# Versioning. ```{note}; We are currently experimenting with our development practices.; These are currently documented on a best effort basis, but may not be completely accurate.; ```. ## Semantic versioning. We try to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) with our versioning scheme.; This scheme breaks down a version number into `{major.minor.point}` sections.; At a `point` release, there should be no changes beyond bug fixes.; `minor` releases can include new features.; `major` releases can break old APIs. ### Version numbers. Valid version numbers are described in [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). [Pre-releases](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases); : should have versions like `1.7.0rc1` or `1.7.0rc2`.; [Development versions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#developmental-releases); : should look like `1.8.0.dev0`, with a commit hash optionally appended as a local version identifier (e.g. `1.8.0.dev2+g00ad77b`). ## Tooling. To be sure we can follow this scheme and maintain some agility in development, we use some tooling and development practices.; When a minor release is made, a release branch should be cut and pushed to the main repo (e.g. `1.7.x` for the `1.7` release series). For PRs which fix an bug in the most recent minor release, the changes will need to added to both the development and release branches.; To accomplish this, PRs which fix bugs must be labelled as such.; After approval, a developer will notify the [meeseeks bot](https://meeseeksbox.github.io) to open a backport PR onto the release branch via a comment saying:. > @Meeseeksdev backport \<branch>. Where ""\<branch>"" is the most recent release branch.

Availability,"(tests)=. # Tests. Possibly the most important part of contributing to any open source package is the test suite.; Implementations may change, but the only way we can know the code is working before making a release is the test suite. ## Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy.; To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). ### Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ###",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:556,down,down,556,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,1,['down'],['down']

To work with the latest version [on GitHub]: clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory. ```shell; gh repo clone scverse/scanpy; cd scanpy; ```. If you are using `pip>=21.3`, an editable install can be made:. ```shell; pip install -e '.[dev,test]'; ```. If you want to let [conda] handle the installations of dependencies, do:. ```shell; pipx install beni; beni pyproject.toml > environment.yml; conda env create -f environment.yml; conda activate scanpy; pip install -e '.[dev,doc,test]'; ```. For instructions on how to work with the code, see the {ref}`contribution guide <contribution-guide>`. ## Docker. If you're using [Docker], you can use e.g. the image [gcfntnu/scanpy] from Docker Hub. ## Troubleshooting. If you get a `Permission denied` error, never use `sudo pip`. Instead, use virtual environments or:. ```shell; pip install --user scanpy; ```. **On MacOS**, if **not** using `conda`, you might need to install the C core of igraph via homebrew first. - `brew install igraph`. - If igraph still fails to install, see the question on [compiling igraph].; Alternatively consider installing gcc via `brew install gcc --without-multilib`; and exporting the required variables:. ```shell; export CC=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; export CXX=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; ```. where `X` and `x` refers to the version of `gcc`;; in my case, the path reads `/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.3.0_1/bin/gcc-6`. **On Windows**, there also often problems installing compiled packages such as `igraph`,; but you can find precompiled packages on Christoph Gohlke’s [unofficial binaries].; Download those and install them using `pip install ./path/to/file.whl`.

One of the most useful things you can include in a docstring is examples of how the function should be used.; These are a great way to demonstrate intended usage and give users a template they can copy and modify.; We're able to include the plots produced by these snippets in the rendered docs using [matplotlib's plot directive](https://matplotlib.org/devel/plot_directive.html).; For examples of this, see the `Examples` sections of {func}`~scanpy.pl.dotplot` or {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`. Note that anything in these sections will need to be run when the docs are built, so please keep them computationally light. - If you need computed features (e.g. an embedding, differential expression results) load data that has this precomputed.; - Try to re-use datasets, this reduces the amount of data that needs to be downloaded to the CI server. ### `Params` section. The `Params` abbreviation is a legit replacement for `Parameters`. To document parameter types use type annotations on function parameters.; These will automatically populate the docstrings on import, and when the documentation is built. Use the python standard library types (defined in [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) modules) for containers, e.g. `Sequence`s (like `list`), `Iterable`s (like `set`), and `Mapping`s (like `dict`).; Always specify what these contain, e.g. `{'a': (1, 2)}` → `Mapping[str, Tuple[int, int]]`.; If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like `AnnData`.; If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: `Literal['elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section.

Scanpy is based on {mod}`anndata`, which provides the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` class. ```{image} https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg; :width: 300px; ```. At the most basic level, an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object `adata` stores; a data matrix `adata.X`, annotation of observations; `adata.obs` and variables `adata.var` as `pd.DataFrame` and unstructured; annotation `adata.uns` as `dict`. Names of observations and; variables can be accessed via `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names`,; respectively. {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects can be sliced like; dataframes, for example, `adata_subset = adata[:, list_of_gene_names]`.; For more, see this [blog post]. To read a data file to an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object, call:. ```; adata = sc.read(filename); ```. to initialize an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object. Possibly add further annotation using, e.g., `pd.read_csv`:. ```; import pandas as pd; anno = pd.read_csv(filename_sample_annotation); adata.obs['cell_groups'] = anno['cell_groups'] # categorical annotation of type pandas.Categorical; adata.obs['time'] = anno['time'] # numerical annotation of type float; # alternatively, you could also set the whole dataframe; # adata.obs = anno; ```. To write, use:. ```; adata.write(filename); adata.write_csvs(filename); adata.write_loom(filename); ```.

Some key points:. - We have some custom sphinx extensions activated. When in doubt, try to copy the style of existing docstrings.; - We autopopulate type information in docstrings when possible, so just add the type information to signatures.; - When docs exist in the same file as code, line length restrictions still apply.

Deployability,"# Making a release. First, check out {doc}`versioning` to see which kind of release you want to make.; That page also explains concepts like *pre-releases* and applications thereof. ## Actually making the release. 1. Go to GitHub’s [releases][] page; 2. Click “Draft a new release”; 3. Click “Choose a tag” and type the version of the tag you want to release, such as `1.9.6`; 4. Click “**+ Create new tag: 1.\<minor>.\<patch>** on publish”; 5. If the version is a *pre-release* version, such as `1.7.0rc1` or `1.10.0a1`, tick the “Set as a pre-release” checkbox. [releases]: https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/releases. ## After making a release. After *any* release has been made:. - Create a new release notes file for the next bugfix release.; This should be included in both dev and stable branches.; - Create a milestone for the next release (in case you made a bugfix release) or releases (in case of a major/minor release).; For bugfix releases, this should have `on-merge: backport to 0.<minor>.x`,; so the [meeseeksdev][] bot will create a backport PR. See {doc}`versioning` for more info.; - Clear out and close the milestone you just made a release for. After a *major* or *minor* release has been made:. - Tweet about it! Announce it on Zulip! Announce it on Discourse! Think about making a bot for this! Maybe actually do that?; - Create a new release notes file for the next minor release. This should only be added to the dev branch.; - Tag the development branch. If you just released `1.7.0`, this would be `1.8.0.dev0`.; - Create a new branch for this release series, like `1.7.x`.

Deployability,"# Usage Principles. Import Scanpy as:. ```; import scanpy as sc; ```. ## Workflow. The typical workflow consists of subsequent calls of data analysis tools; in `sc.tl`, e.g.:. ```; sc.tl.umap(adata, **tool_params) # embed a neighborhood graph of the data using UMAP; ```. where `adata` is an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object.; Each of these calls adds annotation to an expression matrix *X*,; which stores *n_obs* observations (cells) of *n_vars* variables (genes).; For each tool, there typically is an associated plotting function in `sc.pl`:. ```; sc.pl.umap(adata, **plotting_params); ```. If you pass `show=False`, a {class}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance is returned; and you have all of matplotlib's detailed configuration possibilities. To facilitate writing memory-efficient pipelines, by default,; Scanpy tools operate *inplace* on `adata` and return `None` –; this also allows to easily transition to [out-of-memory pipelines].; If you want to return a copy of the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object; and leave the passed `adata` unchanged, pass `copy=True` or `inplace=False`. ## AnnData. Scanpy is based on {mod}`anndata`, which provides the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` class. ```{image} https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg; :width: 300px; ```. At the most basic level, an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object `adata` stores; a data matrix `adata.X`, annotation of observations; `adata.obs` and variables `adata.var` as `pd.DataFrame` and unstructured; annotation `adata.uns` as `dict`. Names of observations and; variables can be accessed via `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names`,; respectively. {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects can be sliced like; dataframes, for example, `adata_subset = adata[:, list_of_gene_names]`.; For more, see this [blog post]. To read a data file to an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object, call:. ```; adata = sc.read(filename); ```. to initialize an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object. Possibly add further annotation using, e.g., `pd.read_csv`:. ```; import ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md:717,configurat,configuration,717,docs/usage-principles.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md,3,"['configurat', 'pipeline']","['configuration', 'pipelines']"
Deployability,"# Versioning. ```{note}; We are currently experimenting with our development practices.; These are currently documented on a best effort basis, but may not be completely accurate.; ```. ## Semantic versioning. We try to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) with our versioning scheme.; This scheme breaks down a version number into `{major.minor.point}` sections.; At a `point` release, there should be no changes beyond bug fixes.; `minor` releases can include new features.; `major` releases can break old APIs. ### Version numbers. Valid version numbers are described in [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). [Pre-releases](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases); : should have versions like `1.7.0rc1` or `1.7.0rc2`.; [Development versions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#developmental-releases); : should look like `1.8.0.dev0`, with a commit hash optionally appended as a local version identifier (e.g. `1.8.0.dev2+g00ad77b`). ## Tooling. To be sure we can follow this scheme and maintain some agility in development, we use some tooling and development practices.; When a minor release is made, a release branch should be cut and pushed to the main repo (e.g. `1.7.x` for the `1.7` release series). For PRs which fix an bug in the most recent minor release, the changes will need to added to both the development and release branches.; To accomplish this, PRs which fix bugs must be labelled as such.; After approval, a developer will notify the [meeseeks bot](https://meeseeksbox.github.io) to open a backport PR onto the release branch via a comment saying:. > @Meeseeksdev backport \<branch>. Where ""\<branch>"" is the most recent release branch.

Deployability,"'elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section. There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Description.; second_identifier; Description 2.; """"""; ...; ```. Many functions also just modify parts of the passed AnnData object, like e.g. {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt`.; You can then combine prose and lists to best describe what happens. ```rst; Returns; -------; Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields. If `n_branchings==0`, no field `dpt_groups` will be written. dpt_pseudotime : :class:`~pandas.Series` (`adata.obs`, dtype `float`); Array of dim (number of samples) that stores the pseudotime of each; cell, that is, the DPT distance with respect to the root cell.; dpt_groups : :class:`pandas.Series` (`adata.obs`, dtype `category`); Array of dim (number of samples) that stores the subgroup id ('0',; '1', ...) for each cell.

Deployability,"(tests)=. # Tests. Possibly the most important part of contributing to any open source package is the test suite.; Implementations may change, but the only way we can know the code is working before making a release is the test suite. ## Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy.; To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). ### Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ###",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:208,release,release,208,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,3,"['install', 'release']","['install', 'release']"

Deployability,"Docker], you can use e.g. the image [gcfntnu/scanpy] from Docker Hub. ## Troubleshooting. If you get a `Permission denied` error, never use `sudo pip`. Instead, use virtual environments or:. ```shell; pip install --user scanpy; ```. **On MacOS**, if **not** using `conda`, you might need to install the C core of igraph via homebrew first. - `brew install igraph`. - If igraph still fails to install, see the question on [compiling igraph].; Alternatively consider installing gcc via `brew install gcc --without-multilib`; and exporting the required variables:. ```shell; export CC=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; export CXX=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; ```. where `X` and `x` refers to the version of `gcc`;; in my case, the path reads `/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.3.0_1/bin/gcc-6`. **On Windows**, there also often problems installing compiled packages such as `igraph`,; but you can find precompiled packages on Christoph Gohlke’s [unofficial binaries].; Download those and install them using `pip install ./path/to/file.whl`.

If you changed something about the build process (e.g. [Hatchling’s build configuration][hatch-build]),; or something about the package’s structure,; you might want to manually check if the build and upload process behaves as expected:. ```shell; # Clear out old distributions; rm -r dist. # Build source distribution and wheel both; python -m build. # Now check those build artifacts; twine check dist/*. # List the wheel archive’s contents; bsdtar -tf dist/*.whl. ```. You can also upload the package to <test.pypi.org> ([tutorial][testpypi tutorial]). [testpypi tutorial]: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives. ```; twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*; ```. The above approximates what the [publish workflow][] does automatically for us.; If you want to replicate the process more exactly, make sure you are careful,; and create a version tag before building (make sure you delete it after uploading to TestPyPI!).

We use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com) to run some styling checks in an automated way.; We also test against these checks, so make sure you follow them!. You can install pre-commit with:. ```shell; pip install pre-commit; ```. You can then install it to run while developing here with:. ```shell; pre-commit install; ```. From the root of the repo. If you choose not to run the hooks on each commit, you can run them manually with `pre-commit run --files={your files}`. (creating-a-branch)=. ### Creating a branch for your feature. All development should occur in branches dedicated to the particular work being done.; Additionally, unless you are a maintainer, all changes should be directed at the `main` branch.; You can create a branch with:. ```shell; git checkout main # Starting from the main branch; git pull # Syncing with the repo; git checkout -b {your-branch-name} # Making and changing to the new branch; ```. (open-a-pr)=. ### Open a pull request. When you're ready to have your code reviewed, push your changes up to your fork:. ```shell; # The first time you push the branch, you'll need to tell git where; git push --set-upstream origin {your-branch-name}; # After that, just use; git push; ```.

After this process completes you can take a look at the docs by opening `scanpy/docs/_build/html/index.html`. Your browser and Sphinx cache docs which have been built previously.; Sometimes these caches are not invalidated when you've updated the docs.; If docs are not updating the way you expect, first try ""force reloading"" your browser page – e.g. reload the page without using the cache.; Next, if problems persist, clear the sphinx cache and try building them again (`make clean` from `docs` directory). ```{note}; If you've cloned the repository pre 1.8.0, you may need to be more thorough in cleaning.; If you run into warnings try removing all untracked files in the docs directory.; ```. ## Adding to the docs. For any user-visible changes, please make sure a note has been added to the release notes for the relevant version so we can credit you!; These files are found in the `docs/release-notes/` directory.; We recommend waiting on this until your PR is close to done since this can often causes merge conflicts. Once you've added a new function to the documentation, you'll need to make sure there is a link somewhere in the documentation site pointing to it.; This should be added to `docs/api.md` under a relevant heading. For tutorials and more in depth examples, consider adding a notebook to [scanpy-tutorials](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy-tutorials/). The tutorials are tied to this repository via a submodule. To update the submodule, run `git submodule update --remote` from the root of the repository. Subsequently, commit and push the changes in a PR. This should be done before each release to ensure the tutorials are up to date. ## docstrings format.

There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Description.; second_identifier; Description 2.; """"""; ...; ```. Many functions also just modify parts of the passed AnnData object, like e.g. {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt`.; You can then combine prose and lists to best describe what happens. ```rst; Returns; -------; Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields. If `n_branchings==0`, no field `dpt_groups` will be written. dpt_pseudotime : :class:`~pandas.Series` (`adata.obs`, dtype `float`); Array of dim (number of samples) that stores the pseudotime of each; cell, that is, the DPT distance with respect to the root cell.; d",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:5517,update,updates,5517,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['update'],['updates']

After *any* release has been made:. - Create a new release notes file for the next bugfix release.; This should be included in both dev and stable branches.; - Create a milestone for the next release (in case you made a bugfix release) or releases (in case of a major/minor release).; For bugfix releases, this should have `on-merge: backport to 0.<minor>.x`,; so the [meeseeksdev][] bot will create a backport PR. See {doc}`versioning` for more info.; - Clear out and close the milestone you just made a release for. After a *major* or *minor* release has been made:. - Tweet about it! Announce it on Zulip! Announce it on Discourse! Think about making a bot for this! Maybe actually do that?; - Create a new release notes file for the next minor release. This should only be added to the dev branch.; - Tag the development branch. If you just released `1.7.0`, this would be `1.8.0.dev0`.; - Create a new branch for this release series, like `1.7.x`. This should get a new release notes file. [meeseeksdev]: https://meeseeksbox.github.io. ## Debugging the build process.

Instead, use virtual environments or:. ```shell; pip install --user scanpy; ```. **On MacOS**, if **not** using `conda`, you might need to install the C core of igraph via homebrew first. - `brew install igraph`. - If igraph still fails to install, see the question on [compiling igraph].; Alternatively consider installing gcc via `brew install gcc --without-multilib`; and exporting the required variables:. ```shell; export CC=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; export CXX=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; ```. where `X` and `x` refers to the version of `gcc`;; in my case, the path reads `/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.3.0_1/bin/gcc-6`. **On Windows**, there also often problems installing compiled packages such as `igraph`,; but you can find precompiled packages on Christoph Gohlke’s [unofficial binaries].; Download those and install them using `pip install ./path/to/file.whl`.

After *any* release has been made:. - Create a new release notes file for the next bugfix release.; This should be included in both dev and stable branches.; - Create a milestone for the next release (in case you made a bugfix release) or releases (in case of a major/minor release).; For bugfix releases, this should have `on-merge: backport to 0.<minor>.x`,; so the [meeseeksdev][] bot will create a backport PR. See {doc}`versioning` for more info.; - Clear out and close the milestone you just made a release for. After a *major* or *minor* release has been made:. - Tweet about it! Announce it on Zulip! Announce it on Discourse! Think about making a bot for this! Maybe actually do that?; - Create a new release notes file for the next minor release. This should only be added to the dev branch.; - Tag the development branch. If you just released `1.7.0`, this would be `1.8.0.dev0`.; - Create a new branch for this release series, like `1.7.x`. This should get a new release notes file. [meeseeksdev]: https://meeseeksbox.github.io. ## Debugging the build process. If you changed something about the build process (e.g. [Hatchling’s build configuration][hatch-build]),; or something about the package’s structure,; you might want to manually check if the build and upload process behaves as expected:. ```shell; # Clear out old distributions; rm -r dist. # Build source distribution and wheel both; python -m build. # Now check those build artifacts; twine check dist/*. # List the wheel archive’s contents; bsdtar -tf dist/*.whl. ```. You can also upload the package to <test.pypi.org> ([tutorial][testpypi tutorial]).

Energy Efficiency,"# Usage Principles. Import Scanpy as:. ```; import scanpy as sc; ```. ## Workflow. The typical workflow consists of subsequent calls of data analysis tools; in `sc.tl`, e.g.:. ```; sc.tl.umap(adata, **tool_params) # embed a neighborhood graph of the data using UMAP; ```. where `adata` is an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object.; Each of these calls adds annotation to an expression matrix *X*,; which stores *n_obs* observations (cells) of *n_vars* variables (genes).; For each tool, there typically is an associated plotting function in `sc.pl`:. ```; sc.pl.umap(adata, **plotting_params); ```. If you pass `show=False`, a {class}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance is returned; and you have all of matplotlib's detailed configuration possibilities. To facilitate writing memory-efficient pipelines, by default,; Scanpy tools operate *inplace* on `adata` and return `None` –; this also allows to easily transition to [out-of-memory pipelines].; If you want to return a copy of the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object; and leave the passed `adata` unchanged, pass `copy=True` or `inplace=False`. ## AnnData. Scanpy is based on {mod}`anndata`, which provides the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` class. ```{image} https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg; :width: 300px; ```. At the most basic level, an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object `adata` stores; a data matrix `adata.X`, annotation of observations; `adata.obs` and variables `adata.var` as `pd.DataFrame` and unstructured; annotation `adata.uns` as `dict`. Names of observations and; variables can be accessed via `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names`,; respectively. {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects can be sliced like; dataframes, for example, `adata_subset = adata[:, list_of_gene_names]`.; For more, see this [blog post]. To read a data file to an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object, call:. ```; adata = sc.read(filename); ```. to initialize an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object. Possibly add further annotation using, e.g., `pd.read_csv`:. ```; import ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md:775,efficient,efficient,775,docs/usage-principles.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

One of the most useful things you can include in a docstring is examples of how the function should be used.; These are a great way to demonstrate intended usage and give users a template they can copy and modify.; We're able to include the plots produced by these snippets in the rendered docs using [matplotlib's plot directive](https://matplotlib.org/devel/plot_directive.html).; For examples of this, see the `Examples` sections of {func}`~scanpy.pl.dotplot` or {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`. Note that anything in these sections will need to be run when the docs are built, so please keep them computationally light. - If you need computed features (e.g. an embedding, differential expression results) load data that has this precomputed.; - Try to re-use datasets, this reduces the amount of data that needs to be downloaded to the CI server. ### `Params` section. The `Params` abbreviation is a legit replacement for `Parameters`. To document parameter types use type annotations on function parameters.; These will automatically populate the docstrings on import, and when the documentation is built. Use the python standard library types (defined in [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) modules) for containers, e.g. `Sequence`s (like `list`), `Iterable`s (like `set`), and `Mapping`s (like `dict`).; Always specify what these contain, e.g. `{'a': (1, 2)}` → `Mapping[str, Tuple[int, int]]`.; If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like `AnnData`.; If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: `Literal['elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section. There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1.

Integrability," Anaconda. If you do not have a working installation of Python 3.6 (or later), consider; installing [Miniconda] (see [Installing Miniconda]). Then run:. ```shell; conda install -c conda-forge scanpy python-igraph leidenalg; ```. Pull Scanpy from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scanpy) (consider using `pip3` to access Python 3):. ```shell; pip install scanpy; ```. ## PyPI only. If you prefer to exclusively use PyPI run:. ```shell; pip install 'scanpy[leiden]'; ```. The extra `[leiden]` installs two packages that are needed for popular; parts of scanpy but aren't requirements: [igraph] {cite:p}`Csardi2006` and [leiden] {cite:p}`Traag2019`. (dev-install-instructions)=. ## Development Version. To work with the latest version [on GitHub]: clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory. ```shell; gh repo clone scverse/scanpy; cd scanpy; ```. If you are using `pip>=21.3`, an editable install can be made:. ```shell; pip install -e '.[dev,test]'; ```. If you want to let [conda] handle the installations of dependencies, do:. ```shell; pipx install beni; beni pyproject.toml > environment.yml; conda env create -f environment.yml; conda activate scanpy; pip install -e '.[dev,doc,test]'; ```. For instructions on how to work with the code, see the {ref}`contribution guide <contribution-guide>`. ## Docker. If you're using [Docker], you can use e.g. the image [gcfntnu/scanpy] from Docker Hub. ## Troubleshooting. If you get a `Permission denied` error, never use `sudo pip`. Instead, use virtual environments or:. ```shell; pip install --user scanpy; ```. **On MacOS**, if **not** using `conda`, you might need to install the C core of igraph via homebrew first. - `brew install igraph`. - If igraph still fails to install, see the question on [compiling igraph].; Alternatively consider installing gcc via `brew install gcc --without-multilib`; and exporting the required variables:. ```shell; export CC=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; export CXX=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/b",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/installation.md:1037,depend,dependencies,1037,docs/installation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/installation.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

For more in-depth guides, we can recommend a few sources:. For a more complete git tutorials we recommend checking out:. - [Atlassian's git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) -- Beginner friendly introductions to the git command line interface; - [Setting up git for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) -- Configuring git to work with your GitHub user account. (forking-and-cloning)=. ### Forking and cloning. To get the code, and be able to push changes back to the main project, you'll need to (1) fork the repository on github and (2) clone the repository to your local machine. This is very straight forward if you're using [GitHub's CLI](https://cli.github.com):. ```shell; $ gh repo fork scverse/scanpy --clone --remote; ```. This will fork the repo to your github account, create a clone of the repo on your current machine, add our repository as a remote, and set the `main` development branch to track our repository. To do this manually, first make a fork of the repository by clicking the ""fork"" button on our main github package. Then, on your machine, run:. ```shell; # Clone your fork of the repository (substitute in your username); git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/scanpy.git; # Enter the cloned repository; cd scanpy; # Add our repository as a remote; git remote add upstream https://github.com/scverse/scanpy.git; # git branch --set-upstream-to ""upstream/main""; ```. ### `pre-commit`. We use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com) to run some styling checks in an automated way.; We also test against these checks, so make sure you follow them!. You can install pre-commit with:. ```shell; pip install pre-commit; ```. You can then install it to run while developing here with:. ```shell; pre-commit install; ```. From the root of the repo.

Integrability,"(tests)=. # Tests. Possibly the most important part of contributing to any open source package is the test suite.; Implementations may change, but the only way we can know the code is working before making a release is the test suite. ## Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy.; To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). ### Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ###",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:381,depend,dependencies,381,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,", 2)}` → `Mapping[str, Tuple[int, int]]`.; If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like `AnnData`.; If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: `Literal['elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section. There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Description.; second_identifier; Description 2.; """"""; ...; ```. Many functions also just modify parts of the passed AnnData object, like e.g. {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt`.; You can then combine prose and lists to best describe what happens. ```rst; Returns; -------; Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields. If `n_branchings==0`, no field `dpt_groups` will be written. dpt_pseudotime : :class:`~pandas.Series` (`adata.obs`, dtype `float`); Array of dim (number of samples) that stores the pseudotime of each; cell, that is, the DPT distance with respect to the root cell.; dpt_groups : :class:`pandas.Series` (`adata.obs`, dtype `category`); ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:5605,depend,depending,5605,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"sics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ### What to test. If you're not sure what to tests about your function, some ideas include:. - Are there arguments which conflict with each other? Check that if they are both passed, the function throws an error (see `pytest.raises` [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).; - Are there input values which should cause your function to error?; - Did you add a helpful error message that recommends better outputs? Check that that error message is actually thrown.; - Can you place bounds on the values returned by your function?; - Are there different input values which should generate equivalent output (e.g. if an array is sparse or dense)?; - Do you have arguments which should have orthogonal effects on the output? Check that they are independent. For example, if there is a flag for extended output, the base output should remain the same either way.; - Are you optimizing a method? Check that it's results are the same as a gold standard implementation. ### Performance. It's more important that you're accurately testing the code works than it is that test suite runs quickly.; That said, it's nice when the test suite runs fast. You can check how long tests take to run by passing `--durations=0` argument to `pytest`.; Hopefully your new tests won't show up on top!; Some approaches to this include:. - Is there a common setup/ computation happening in each",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:2437,message,message,2437,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,2,['message'],['message']

If you changed something about the build process (e.g. [Hatchling’s build configuration][hatch-build]),; or something about the package’s structure,; you might want to manually check if the build and upload process behaves as expected:. ```shell; # Clear out old distributions; rm -r dist. # Build source distribution and wheel both; python -m build. # Now check those build artifacts; twine check dist/*. # List the wheel archive’s contents; bsdtar -tf dist/*.whl. ```.

The typical workflow consists of subsequent calls of data analysis tools; in `sc.tl`, e.g.:. ```; sc.tl.umap(adata, **tool_params) # embed a neighborhood graph of the data using UMAP; ```. where `adata` is an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object.; Each of these calls adds annotation to an expression matrix *X*,; which stores *n_obs* observations (cells) of *n_vars* variables (genes).; For each tool, there typically is an associated plotting function in `sc.pl`:. ```; sc.pl.umap(adata, **plotting_params); ```. If you pass `show=False`, a {class}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance is returned; and you have all of matplotlib's detailed configuration possibilities. To facilitate writing memory-efficient pipelines, by default,; Scanpy tools operate *inplace* on `adata` and return `None` –; this also allows to easily transition to [out-of-memory pipelines].; If you want to return a copy of the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object; and leave the passed `adata` unchanged, pass `copy=True` or `inplace=False`. ## AnnData. Scanpy is based on {mod}`anndata`, which provides the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` class. ```{image} https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg; :width: 300px; ```. At the most basic level, an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object `adata` stores; a data matrix `adata.X`, annotation of observations; `adata.obs` and variables `adata.var` as `pd.DataFrame` and unstructured; annotation `adata.uns` as `dict`. Names of observations and; variables can be accessed via `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names`,; respectively. {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects can be sliced like; dataframes, for example, `adata_subset = adata[:, list_of_gene_names]`.; For more, see this [blog post]. To read a data file to an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object, call:. ```; adata = sc.read(filename); ```. to initialize an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object. Possibly add further annotation using, e.g., `pd.read_csv`:. ```; import ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md:447,variab,variables,447,docs/usage-principles.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/usage-principles.md,2,"['config', 'variab']","['configuration', 'variables']"

There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```.

There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Description.; second_identifier; Description 2.; """"""; ...; ```.

It's more important that you're accurately testing the code works than it is that test suite runs quickly.; That said, it's nice when the test suite runs fast. You can check how long tests take to run by passing `--durations=0` argument to `pytest`.; Hopefully your new tests won't show up on top!; Some approaches to this include:. - Is there a common setup/ computation happening in each test? Consider caching these in a [scoped test fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html#sharing-test-data).; - Is the behaviour you're testing for dependent on the size of the data? If not, consider reducing it. ### Plotting tests. While computational functions will return arrays and values, it can be harder to work with the output of plotting functions. To make this easier, we use the `image_comparer` fixture for comparing plotting results (search the test suite for example usage).; This is used to check that generated plots look the same as they did previously.; Reference images (the expected output) are stored as `expected.png` to relevant tests directory under `scanpy/tests/_images`.; When run, the test suite will generate `actual.png` files for each check.; These files are compared, and if the `actual` plot differs from the reference plot, a `diff` of the images is also generated.; Paths for all these files will be reported when a test fails, and images for failed plots can be viewed via the :doc:`CI interface <ci>`. A common gotcha here is that plots often change slightly on different machines/ OSs.; `scanpy`'s test suite sets a number of environment variables to ensure as similar of plots as possible.; When adding new reference plots, the recommended workflow is to write the test as though an expected result already exists, run it once to generate the output, then move that output to the reference directory.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:4622,variab,variables,4622,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function.

It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ### What to test. If you're not sure what to tests about your function, some ideas include:. - Are there arguments which conflict with each other? Check that if they are both passed, the function throws an error (see `pytest.raises` [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).; - Are there input values which should cause your function to error?; - Did you add a helpful error message that recommends better outputs? Check that that error message is actually thrown.; - Can you place bounds on the values returned by your function?; - Are there different input values which should generate equivalent output (e.g. if an array is sparse or dense)?; - Do you have arguments which should have orthogonal effects on the output?

Performance," to forget to add a reference to function, be sure it got added and looks right.

One of the most useful things you can include in a docstring is examples of how the function should be used.; These are a great way to demonstrate intended usage and give users a template they can copy and modify.; We're able to include the plots produced by these snippets in the rendered docs using [matplotlib's plot directive](https://matplotlib.org/devel/plot_directive.html).; For examples of this, see the `Examples` sections of {func}`~scanpy.pl.dotplot` or {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`. Note that anything in these sections will need to be run when the docs are built, so please keep them computationally light. - If you need computed features (e.g. an embedding, differential expression results) load data that has this precomputed.; - Try to re-use datasets, this reduces the amount of data that needs to be downloaded to the CI server. ### `Params` section. The `Params` abbreviation is a legit replacement for `Parameters`. To document parameter types use type annotations on function parameters.; These will automatically populate the docstrings on import, and when the documentation is built. Use the python standard library types (defined in [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) modules) for containers, e.g. `Sequence`s (like `list`), `Iterable`s (like `set`), and `Mapping`s (like `dict`).; Always specify what these contain, e.g. `{'a': (1, 2)}` → `Mapping[str, Tuple[int, int]]`.; If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like `AnnData`.; If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: `Literal['elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section.",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:3863,load,load,3863,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"# Documentation. (building-the-docs)=. ## Building the docs. Dependencies for building the documentation for scanpy can be installed with `pip install -e ""scanpy[doc]""`. To build the docs, enter the `docs` directory and run `make html`. After this process completes you can take a look at the docs by opening `scanpy/docs/_build/html/index.html`. Your browser and Sphinx cache docs which have been built previously.; Sometimes these caches are not invalidated when you've updated the docs.; If docs are not updating the way you expect, first try ""force reloading"" your browser page – e.g. reload the page without using the cache.; Next, if problems persist, clear the sphinx cache and try building them again (`make clean` from `docs` directory). ```{note}; If you've cloned the repository pre 1.8.0, you may need to be more thorough in cleaning.; If you run into warnings try removing all untracked files in the docs directory.; ```. ## Adding to the docs. For any user-visible changes, please make sure a note has been added to the release notes for the relevant version so we can credit you!; These files are found in the `docs/release-notes/` directory.; We recommend waiting on this until your PR is close to done since this can often causes merge conflicts. Once you've added a new function to the documentation, you'll need to make sure there is a link somewhere in the documentation site pointing to it.; This should be added to `docs/api.md` under a relevant heading. For tutorials and more in depth examples, consider adding a notebook to [scanpy-tutorials](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy-tutorials/). The tutorials are tied to this repository via a submodule. To update the submodule, run `git submodule update --remote` from the root of the repository. Subsequently, commit and push the changes in a PR. This should be done before each release to ensure the tutorials are up to date. ## docstrings format.

Performance,"suite for existing usage. ### What to test. If you're not sure what to tests about your function, some ideas include:. - Are there arguments which conflict with each other? Check that if they are both passed, the function throws an error (see `pytest.raises` [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).; - Are there input values which should cause your function to error?; - Did you add a helpful error message that recommends better outputs? Check that that error message is actually thrown.; - Can you place bounds on the values returned by your function?; - Are there different input values which should generate equivalent output (e.g. if an array is sparse or dense)?; - Do you have arguments which should have orthogonal effects on the output? Check that they are independent. For example, if there is a flag for extended output, the base output should remain the same either way.; - Are you optimizing a method? Check that it's results are the same as a gold standard implementation. ### Performance. It's more important that you're accurately testing the code works than it is that test suite runs quickly.; That said, it's nice when the test suite runs fast. You can check how long tests take to run by passing `--durations=0` argument to `pytest`.; Hopefully your new tests won't show up on top!; Some approaches to this include:. - Is there a common setup/ computation happening in each test? Consider caching these in a [scoped test fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html#sharing-test-data).; - Is the behaviour you're testing for dependent on the size of the data? If not, consider reducing it. ### Plotting tests. While computational functions will return arrays and values, it can be harder to work with the output of plotting functions. To make this easier, we use the `image_comparer` fixture for comparing plotting results (search the test suite for example usage).; This is used to check that generated",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:2932,optimiz,optimizing,2932,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizing']

If you pass `show=False`, a {class}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance is returned; and you have all of matplotlib's detailed configuration possibilities. To facilitate writing memory-efficient pipelines, by default,; Scanpy tools operate *inplace* on `adata` and return `None` –; this also allows to easily transition to [out-of-memory pipelines].; If you want to return a copy of the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object; and leave the passed `adata` unchanged, pass `copy=True` or `inplace=False`. ## AnnData. Scanpy is based on {mod}`anndata`, which provides the {class}`~anndata.AnnData` class. ```{image} https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg; :width: 300px; ```. At the most basic level, an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object `adata` stores; a data matrix `adata.X`, annotation of observations; `adata.obs` and variables `adata.var` as `pd.DataFrame` and unstructured; annotation `adata.uns` as `dict`. Names of observations and; variables can be accessed via `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names`,; respectively. {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects can be sliced like; dataframes, for example, `adata_subset = adata[:, list_of_gene_names]`.; For more, see this [blog post]. To read a data file to an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object, call:. ```; adata = sc.read(filename); ```. to initialize an {class}`~anndata.AnnData` object. Possibly add further annotation using, e.g., `pd.read_csv`:. ```; import pandas as pd; anno = pd.read_csv(filename_sample_annotation); adata.obs['cell_groups'] = anno['cell_groups'] # categorical annotation of type pandas.Categorical; adata.obs['time'] = anno['time'] # numerical annotation of type float; # alternatively, you could also set the whole dataframe; # adata.obs = anno; ```. To write, use:. ```; adata.write(filename); adata.write_csvs(filename); adata.write_loom(filename); ```.

Security,"# Installation. ## Anaconda. If you do not have a working installation of Python 3.6 (or later), consider; installing [Miniconda] (see [Installing Miniconda]). Then run:. ```shell; conda install -c conda-forge scanpy python-igraph leidenalg; ```. Pull Scanpy from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scanpy) (consider using `pip3` to access Python 3):. ```shell; pip install scanpy; ```. ## PyPI only. If you prefer to exclusively use PyPI run:. ```shell; pip install 'scanpy[leiden]'; ```. The extra `[leiden]` installs two packages that are needed for popular; parts of scanpy but aren't requirements: [igraph] {cite:p}`Csardi2006` and [leiden] {cite:p}`Traag2019`. (dev-install-instructions)=. ## Development Version. To work with the latest version [on GitHub]: clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory. ```shell; gh repo clone scverse/scanpy; cd scanpy; ```. If you are using `pip>=21.3`, an editable install can be made:. ```shell; pip install -e '.[dev,test]'; ```. If you want to let [conda] handle the installations of dependencies, do:. ```shell; pipx install beni; beni pyproject.toml > environment.yml; conda env create -f environment.yml; conda activate scanpy; pip install -e '.[dev,doc,test]'; ```. For instructions on how to work with the code, see the {ref}`contribution guide <contribution-guide>`. ## Docker. If you're using [Docker], you can use e.g. the image [gcfntnu/scanpy] from Docker Hub. ## Troubleshooting. If you get a `Permission denied` error, never use `sudo pip`. Instead, use virtual environments or:. ```shell; pip install --user scanpy; ```. **On MacOS**, if **not** using `conda`, you might need to install the C core of igraph via homebrew first. - `brew install igraph`. - If igraph still fails to install, see the question on [compiling igraph].; Alternatively consider installing gcc via `brew install gcc --without-multilib`; and exporting the required variables:. ```shell; export CC=""/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.x.x/bin/gcc-X""; export CXX=""/usr/local/C",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/installation.md:330,access,access,330,docs/installation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/installation.md,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"# Versioning. ```{note}; We are currently experimenting with our development practices.; These are currently documented on a best effort basis, but may not be completely accurate.; ```. ## Semantic versioning. We try to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) with our versioning scheme.; This scheme breaks down a version number into `{major.minor.point}` sections.; At a `point` release, there should be no changes beyond bug fixes.; `minor` releases can include new features.; `major` releases can break old APIs. ### Version numbers. Valid version numbers are described in [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). [Pre-releases](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases); : should have versions like `1.7.0rc1` or `1.7.0rc2`.; [Development versions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#developmental-releases); : should look like `1.8.0.dev0`, with a commit hash optionally appended as a local version identifier (e.g. `1.8.0.dev2+g00ad77b`). ## Tooling. To be sure we can follow this scheme and maintain some agility in development, we use some tooling and development practices.; When a minor release is made, a release branch should be cut and pushed to the main repo (e.g. `1.7.x` for the `1.7` release series). For PRs which fix an bug in the most recent minor release, the changes will need to added to both the development and release branches.; To accomplish this, PRs which fix bugs must be labelled as such.; After approval, a developer will notify the [meeseeks bot](https://meeseeksbox.github.io) to open a backport PR onto the release branch via a comment saying:. > @Meeseeksdev backport \<branch>. Where ""\<branch>"" is the most recent release branch. The bot will attempt to make a backport and open a PR.; This will sometimes require manual intervention due to merge conflicts or test failures.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/versioning.md:880,hash,hash,880,docs/dev/versioning.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/versioning.md,1,['hash'],['hash']

Testability," suite.; Implementations may change, but the only way we can know the code is working before making a release is the test suite. ## Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy.; To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel.

[Pre-releases](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases); : should have versions like `1.7.0rc1` or `1.7.0rc2`.; [Development versions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#developmental-releases); : should look like `1.8.0.dev0`, with a commit hash optionally appended as a local version identifier (e.g. `1.8.0.dev2+g00ad77b`). ## Tooling. To be sure we can follow this scheme and maintain some agility in development, we use some tooling and development practices.; When a minor release is made, a release branch should be cut and pushed to the main repo (e.g. `1.7.x` for the `1.7` release series). For PRs which fix an bug in the most recent minor release, the changes will need to added to both the development and release branches.; To accomplish this, PRs which fix bugs must be labelled as such.; After approval, a developer will notify the [meeseeks bot](https://meeseeksbox.github.io) to open a backport PR onto the release branch via a comment saying:. > @Meeseeksdev backport \<branch>. Where ""\<branch>"" is the most recent release branch. The bot will attempt to make a backport and open a PR.; This will sometimes require manual intervention due to merge conflicts or test failures.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/versioning.md:1818,test,test,1818,docs/dev/versioning.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/versioning.md,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"(tests)=. # Tests. Possibly the most important part of contributing to any open source package is the test suite.; Implementations may change, but the only way we can know the code is working before making a release is the test suite. ## Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy.; To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). ### Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ###",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:1,test,tests,1,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,11,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Check that that error message is actually thrown.; - Can you place bounds on the values returned by your function?; - Are there different input values which should generate equivalent output (e.g. if an array is sparse or dense)?; - Do you have arguments which should have orthogonal effects on the output? Check that they are independent. For example, if there is a flag for extended output, the base output should remain the same either way.; - Are you optimizing a method?

Your browser and Sphinx cache docs which have been built previously.; Sometimes these caches are not invalidated when you've updated the docs.; If docs are not updating the way you expect, first try ""force reloading"" your browser page – e.g. reload the page without using the cache.; Next, if problems persist, clear the sphinx cache and try building them again (`make clean` from `docs` directory). ```{note}; If you've cloned the repository pre 1.8.0, you may need to be more thorough in cleaning.; If you run into warnings try removing all untracked files in the docs directory.; ```. ## Adding to the docs. For any user-visible changes, please make sure a note has been added to the release notes for the relevant version so we can credit you!; These files are found in the `docs/release-notes/` directory.; We recommend waiting on this until your PR is close to done since this can often causes merge conflicts. Once you've added a new function to the documentation, you'll need to make sure there is a link somewhere in the documentation site pointing to it.; This should be added to `docs/api.md` under a relevant heading. For tutorials and more in depth examples, consider adding a notebook to [scanpy-tutorials](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy-tutorials/). The tutorials are tied to this repository via a submodule. To update the submodule, run `git submodule update --remote` from the root of the repository. Subsequently, commit and push the changes in a PR. This should be done before each release to ensure the tutorials are up to date. ## docstrings format. We use the numpydoc style for writing docstrings.; We'd primarily suggest lookin",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:658,clear,clear,658,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"# Getting set up. ## Working with `git`. This section of the docs covers our practices for working with `git` on our codebase. For more in-depth guides, we can recommend a few sources:. For a more complete git tutorials we recommend checking out:. - [Atlassian's git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) -- Beginner friendly introductions to the git command line interface; - [Setting up git for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) -- Configuring git to work with your GitHub user account. (forking-and-cloning)=. ### Forking and cloning. To get the code, and be able to push changes back to the main project, you'll need to (1) fork the repository on github and (2) clone the repository to your local machine. This is very straight forward if you're using [GitHub's CLI](https://cli.github.com):. ```shell; $ gh repo fork scverse/scanpy --clone --remote; ```. This will fork the repo to your github account, create a clone of the repo on your current machine, add our repository as a remote, and set the `main` development branch to track our repository. To do this manually, first make a fork of the repository by clicking the ""fork"" button on our main github package. Then, on your machine, run:. ```shell; # Clone your fork of the repository (substitute in your username); git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/scanpy.git; # Enter the cloned repository; cd scanpy; # Add our repository as a remote; git remote add upstream https://github.com/scverse/scanpy.git; # git branch --set-upstream-to ""upstream/main""; ```. ### `pre-commit`. We use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com) to run some styling checks in an automated way.; We also test against these checks, so make sure you follow them!. You can install pre-commit with:. ```shell; pip install pre-commit; ```. You can then install it to run while developing here with:. ```shell; pre-commit install; ```. From the root of the repo.

There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Description.; second_identifier; Description 2.; """"""; ...; ```. Many functions also just modify parts of the passed AnnData object, like e.g. {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt`.; You can then combine prose and lists to best describe what happens. ```rst; Returns; -------; Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields.

Usability,"s first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e "".[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k ""test_umap*""`; 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). ### Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ### What to test. If you're not sure what to tests about your function, some ideas include:. - Are there arguments which conflict with each other? Check that if they are both passed, the function throws an error (see `pytest.raises` [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).; - Ar",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md:1367,guid,guide,1367,docs/dev/testing.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/testing.md,1,['guid'],['guide']
Usability,"s for the relevant version so we can credit you!; These files are found in the `docs/release-notes/` directory.; We recommend waiting on this until your PR is close to done since this can often causes merge conflicts. Once you've added a new function to the documentation, you'll need to make sure there is a link somewhere in the documentation site pointing to it.; This should be added to `docs/api.md` under a relevant heading. For tutorials and more in depth examples, consider adding a notebook to [scanpy-tutorials](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy-tutorials/). The tutorials are tied to this repository via a submodule. To update the submodule, run `git submodule update --remote` from the root of the repository. Subsequently, commit and push the changes in a PR. This should be done before each release to ensure the tutorials are up to date. ## docstrings format. We use the numpydoc style for writing docstrings.; We'd primarily suggest looking at existing docstrings for examples, but the [napolean guide to numpy style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy) is also a great source.; If you're unfamiliar with the reStructuredText (`rst`) markup format, [Sphinx has a useful primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html). Some key points:. - We have some custom sphinx extensions activated. When in doubt, try to copy the style of existing docstrings.; - We autopopulate type information in docstrings when possible, so just add the type information to signatures.; - When docs exist in the same file as code, line length restrictions still apply. In files which are just docs, go with a sentence per line (for easier `git diff`s).; - Check that the docs look like what you expect them too! It's easy to forget to add a reference to function, be sure it got added and looks right. Look at [sc.tl.louvain](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/a811fee0ef44fcaecbde0cad6336336bce649484/scan",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:2058,guid,guide,2058,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['guid'],['guide']
Usability,"t of data that needs to be downloaded to the CI server. ### `Params` section. The `Params` abbreviation is a legit replacement for `Parameters`. To document parameter types use type annotations on function parameters.; These will automatically populate the docstrings on import, and when the documentation is built. Use the python standard library types (defined in [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) modules) for containers, e.g. `Sequence`s (like `list`), `Iterable`s (like `set`), and `Mapping`s (like `dict`).; Always specify what these contain, e.g. `{'a': (1, 2)}` → `Mapping[str, Tuple[int, int]]`.; If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like `AnnData`.; If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: `Literal['elem-1', 'elem-2']`. ### `Returns` section. There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. 1. Prose is for simple cases.; 2. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and *not* by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header.; 3. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you *added something as annotation to an \`AnnData\` object*. #### Examples. For simple cases, use prose as in; {func}`~scanpy.pp.normalize_total`. ```rst; Returns; -------; Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`; or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original; `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.; ```. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,; e.g. as in {func}`~scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`.; Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. ```python; def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:; """"""; ...; Returns; -------; one_identifier; Descript",MatchSource.DOCS,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md:4950,simpl,simple,4950,docs/dev/documentation.md,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/1.10.2/docs/dev/documentation.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
