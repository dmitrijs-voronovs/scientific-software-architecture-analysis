Testability,"@dpiparo @bbockelm ,. Hi Danilo,. Based on current cache replacement policy, the cache will be invalidated (set fIsTransferred to kFALSE) immediately once the first event miss occurs. In my current implementation, each task monitors fIsTransferred and return immediately without doing actual unzipping work. But we still need to create tasks corresponding to the number of baskets. I am wondering if we should add task_group.cancel() function into TTaskGroup interface? In that case, the main thread only needs to cancel all tasks once the cache is invalid. . With event simulation benchmark, I did not see too much difference between task_group wait and cancel.

I have little knowledge about multi-threading, and was just (naïvely) looking for an RDataFrame anology of creating a TTree inside a TDirectory. It simply seemed strange to have to close the file and reopen.

Testability,"@guitargeek While addressing your comments, I started thinking that there's perhaps a better design. 1. I don't think we should have a default parameter at all, but only one ctor with the offset parameters. In real life current cases, these classes are always used from MinuitFcnGrad and they always share offsets with one or two other Likelihood* objects. The only cases where no shared offsets are necessary is in unit tests, but in those cases it's easy to just create a dummy offset vector.; 2. All the offset management is distracting a bit from the core Likelihood logic. I think it may be nicer to make a simple wrapper class `LikelihoodOffset` that holds the shared_ptrs to the vectors, does the swapping, and a few other things. This also makes it easier to create, because the unwieldy types that you also rightly point out would then only be contained within `LikelihoodOffset`. I will start working on point 1 at least, and in the meantime will consider (and allow you to comment on ;) ) point 2.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202#issuecomment-2091419386:421,test,tests,421,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202#issuecomment-2091419386,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tests']"

Not a dealbreaker but the FreeBSD __cxa_thread_call_dtors is a bit verbose and prints warnings to stderr about that. Also here there is quite some room for experts to look at since there already are mitigations to similar issues in the code.

I now checked and these failure occur as well with `v6.30` and `v6.32`.

Testability,"@hahnjo Thanks for the comment! I can move it there, but do I really need to derive from TRandomEngine? The parent methods are for double Rndm(), which does not seem very useful to me.; This generator is a binary register generator, so rather a quite different structure, and it is not intended to be used as a normal generator, but rather as a test scenario or helper math functions for electronics testing. It also is inherently templated, etc. It returns an array rather than just a number Rndm(). See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8798/files#diff-2e848ceefaff2e24c9b2970fb86a8da1d3d00603fc4f48f920421e603198fab2.

Testability,"@hahnjo hm that's an interesting clue, but then I still don't fully understand why `RooFit::TestStatistics::RooUnbinnedL` would give a different answer, because it also just calls `RooAbsPdf::extendedTerm`, so it should still get the exact same result... Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. Or, even more problematically, could such FMA operations also cause similar rounding errors on x86 so that EXPECT_EQ indeed becomes impossible (and I just got lucky with the current parameters on x86)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1544370239:92,Test,TestStatistics,92,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1544370239,2,"['Test', 'test']","['TestStatistics', 'test']"

Otherwise, given that we have access to the xrootd >library, perhaps we can spawn a simple ad-hoc server in another thread. Well, I think one nice thing that we could do is to have an XRootD server with an HTTP plugin exporting same files with both root and HTTP protocols. Then we could simply run all the tests you currently have for the `RRawFileDavix` also for `RRawFileNetXNG`. If you have some stress tests we could even use them to benchmark the two protocols.; Could we use `root.cern.ch` to do this?

All logging is now done through `MnPrint`, which gained a static method `Log` with a severity level, a prefix for the actual message (usually set to the class name to indicate the origin of the message), and the actual message, which can consist of strings and streamable objects. For convenience, there are methods `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Debug`, which use a globally set prefix for convenience and to make the code more readable and less redundant. The global prefix is set with a scope guard. Thanks to RAII, this works also for nested scopes. . Since I was going through all the code anyway, I replaced some c headers with the corresponding cxx headers (e.g. math.h with cmath).

Having this is creating circular dependency:. ```; CMake Error: The inter-target dependency graph contains the following strongly connected component (cycle):; ""FTGL"" of type SHARED_LIBRARY; depends on ""RGL"" (weak); ""RGL"" of type SHARED_LIBRARY; depends on ""FTGL"" (weak); At least one of these targets is not a STATIC_LIBRARY. Cyclic dependencies are allowed only among static libraries.; CMake Generate step failed. Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.; make: *** [Makefile:9096: cmake_check_build_system] Error 1; ```.

Hence, I think the impact here is going to be more noticeable as we increase deserialization speed. @pseyfert - if it's not possible to post the file, could you rebuild your ROOT with the `LZ4-HC` algorithm that @zzxuanyuan used in this PR and then check the filesize?

Just moving function definition of IPruneTool causes cmsUnload test failure with master, which can be seen in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2848 or https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/258d5c41f042dc260adfd24d5d51906a9c326236. This is very weird. Cling is failing to correctly unload AutoParse regardless of whether it has modules or not. I also thought that Cling was only partially removing transaction for AutoParse, but actually AutoParse was stored in one transaction so it wasn't a problem.

Testability,"@pcanal ; One could have used TNamed: I did not think about that. That might not have been enough though: see my comment below.; About the speedup: it is indeed not due to the different container! If there is a difference in runtime between the two, it is undetectable. The difference comes from the fact that the graph built with TDF nodes is sophisticated and the same columns end up being inputs of Filters and Defines. As a result a single column, even holding a long-ish array, ends up being read many times. Given that the proxy is not re-used, deserialisation happened N times, with the associated overhead.; @Axel-Naumann ; About the crashes: I am surprised about so many crashes - checked the TDF tests on ubu16 before creating the PR and only the dataframe_friends test failed. I think that one is understood. The problem is that the same proxy is used for branches with the same name even if they come from two different trees which are friends.

Testability,"@pcanal, yes the improvement from using TBB with TReentrantRWLock for gCoreMutex is only 7% in this case, but actually the use of RW locks instead of always write locks in ```TBufferFile::ReadClassBuffer``` is a much bigger improvement (and the comparisons I was showing for the RWLock variants was always on top of this). For a smaller test with only 9.7M events in 19 input files (instead of 513M events in 1000 input files), using; 256 threads and ```ROOT.TTreeProcessorMT.SetMaxTasksPerFilePerWorker(1)``` the numbers are:. ```; Baseline:; Percent of CPU this job got: 397%; Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 24:56.08. + Use read-write locks in TBufferFile::ReadClassBuffer; Percent of CPU this job got: 3971%; Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:18.81. + TBBUnique for gCoreMutex; Percent of CPU this job got: 4765%; Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:16.00; ```.

Testability,"@sawenzel I get your point about thread safety, and agree that even the previous version was thread-unsafe, so I will deal with this later. The current version introduces a rather large critical section in `TGeoParallelWorld::InitSafetyVoxel` that blocks all concurrent threads even if they want to update the cache of different voxels, I would have pushed that lock a bit below where the update of the cache actually happens. But since this does not run in MT mode this is not critical now. Could you also do clang-formatting using ROOT style for the `bvh` part only (The entirety of TGeo is not yet formatted, but we will do it at some point), however the new files should be formatted. I looked and the internal thread pool is actually used for building the BVH in parallel, which is cool, but there may still be some unused headers, such as `sphere.h` - could you cross-check that and remove whatever is not needed?. The compilation errors on Mac are unrelated to your PR. Still, the compilation on alma8 with gcc8.5 fails, although it should not because the standard is set correctly to C++17 and the header <numeric> is included. ; ```; Error: /github/home/ROOT-CI/src/geom/geom/inc/bvh/v2/vec.h:99:17: error: ‘transform_reduce’ is not a member of ‘std’; ```; So @dpiparo what do we do about this since the `gcc` compliance with C++17 is known to be stable only starting with the gcc9 series?

Testability,"@vgvassilev I have updated the PR to include a similar patch for the SourceManager and at least the trivial test seems to work fine, including a nice 9MB reduction in memory allocations. I am now testing with the ALICE analysis framework. I have also done a few of the cleanups, and it now only exposes an ""expand"" interface (basically resize without shrinking). AFAICT, it's not worth to implement the full ""resize"" functionality, given it's complicated and at least the places I fixed never shrink. I think also the calloc approach might not be a good idea given realloc does not guarantee that the memory is zeroed and besides that page ranges might be a tad too big for vector of pointers and so on. I would put aside that idea, at least for now. My current plan:. * Verify with larger tests using ALICE analysis and asynchronous reconstruction.; * Unify the two PagedVector implementations I currently have (one for ASTReader and one for SourceManager).; * Use fixed size ranges, so that I can get rid of the ranges in my internal index and just keep where each page was allocated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305:108,test,test,108,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305,3,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"@vgvassilev It seems that the changes in this PR provide the same performance as the current master (after the two hotfixes), while supporting leaving the `k*` constants in `TError.h` as `constexpr` so without producing a symbol in `libCore.so`. For `TString::kNPOS` I guess we want to leave the commit there since it was anyway a real fix to a bug. Another problem which is still present in both the current master and even after this PR is that the number of file operations is still quite high, i.e.; ```; 532 newfstatat(3, ; 29 newfstatat(4, ; 10141 newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ; 546 openat(AT_FDCWD, ; 843 readlink(; ```. which are exactly the same whether current master or this patch. Consider that many of those `newfstatat` calls are spurious and I'm trying to understand where they come from. Take the following as an example; ```; newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ""/home/vpadulan/programs/rootproject/rootbuild/reduce-symbol-search-release/gui/sessionviewer/input_line_11"", 0x7ffde442f050, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory); ```. Note the presence of the `rootbuild` directory, which is the path where I store the ROOT build artifacts, even though I am using ROOT from the install directory. I thought it was something in the machinery of `(T)cling` but so far my tests haven't brought me to any conclusion. Another suspicion is that the path to the build directory is hardcoded somehow in the `.pcm` or in the AST and doesn't get converted to the install directory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890:1265,test,tests,1265,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@vgvassilev Let me clarify the disconnect. The title says ""Add **a** module for experimental/string_view""; The commit says:.

The code says:; ```; module ""experimental/string_view"" {; export *; header ""experimental/algorithm""; }; ```; ; The commit content as-is seems completely unrelated to the commit log as far as I could tell (without doing research on the relationship between `range_base`, `string_view` and `algorithm`.; ; So I pondered whether the fix was the right fix for a problem I did not know anything about ... ; ; The right thing to do would have probably be have been to request a complete explanation of what the original problem was, what was the mechanism leading to the error and why this solution was the best solution.

The failure presented during dictionary generation in a C++14 and C++17 build and incorrectly complained about needing the 'cplusplus20' feature for the 'std.bits/ranges_base.h' module. The issue was triggered by an inclusion of `<bits/ranges_base.h>` from `string_view`. This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). . It seems the issue is solved by exporting `algorithm` as part of the `string_view` module.; ```.

Testability,"@zzxuanyuan I ran a production test job for 18 different compression settings - zlib from level 1 to 9 and lzma from level 1 to 9, each time the same events. Size is the size of the output file in Byte. I ran through valgrind/callgrind and the cycles are the number of cycles spent in the R__zipMultipleAlgorithm function (and functions called from there). The spike in the lzma curve is something i haven't understood yet I want to crosscheck it running over a different set of events (possibly more, though then it gets annoying in space requirements of the output and in the time the tests take). Not included in the numbers in neither test/summary.txt nor the plot is the RAM usage of a production job (just running tcmalloc with heap profiling and reporting the peak usage. this comes probably with large overhead because i report the memory usage of the full process, not only the compression); (was a different job than the one from which the filesize and cycle counts come). zlib:x 237 MB; lzma:1 239 MB; lzma:2 241 MB; lzma:3 262 MB; lzma:4 276 MB; lzma:5 322 MB; lzma:6 322 MB; lzma:7 411 MB; lzma:8 600 MB; lzma:9 904 MB. please also look at [this file](https://github.com/pseyfert/root-compression/blob/master/test/summary.txt) for the analyst root file where i not only report numbers for writing, but also for reading (though it seems the last column seems buggy).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/81#issuecomment-166231386:31,test,test,31,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/81#issuecomment-166231386,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"About the failing tests, they now fail because they check for `kEntryNotFound` after an event loop finishes normally. In `TTreeReaderBasic.ZeroEntryRange` and `TTreeReaderBasic.InvertedEntryRange` the following logic is present (the comments also come from the current test code):. ```cpp; // Read beyond end:; EXPECT_FALSE(tr.Next());; // As the TTree only has up to entry 19, 20 is kEntryNotFound:; EXPECT_EQ(TTreeReader::kEntryNotFound, tr.GetEntryStatus());; ```. Similarly, `TTreeReaderBasic.EntryListBeyondEnd` expects `kEntryNotFound` after the last `r.Next()` when a `TEntryList` is present.

Furthermore ASAN blame the line: `hist/hist/G__Hist.cxx:15989` for the creation of the `TClass` object but this line is toward the end of the line and hence likely to be related to a `TClass` for one of the STL collection which should not be deleted.

Note that as the ""TODO"" in that method says, it's possible to further refine `Sequence_Check` by verifying that the `operator[]()` takes and int-like argument and/or that the class defines a `__len__` of sorts. However, `PySequence_Check` doesn't do any of that either, so I've punted on that for now, but I can add if desired. The method does not check for `__iter__` as `PySequence_GetItem()` would fail for otherwise iterable containers (such as `std::list`).

Testability,"After some investigation, it seems this issue is due to the priority level assigned to the two overloads. Specifically, the logic at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/896940ef8c0936ad394a1cf6b98d1d8fbaabbfff/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/CPyCppyy/src/CPPMethod.cxx#L408-L412. seems to aim at assigning higher priority to class types that have a deeper inheritance chain. In the reproducer above, this should translate to class `B` having priority 1 (because it has 1 base class `A`) and class `C` having priority 2 (because it has 2 base classes `A,B`). The function this logic relies on ([GetNumBases](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/87a998d48803bc207288d90038e60ff148827664/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy-backend/clingwrapper/src/clingwrapper.cxx#L1212)) in turn calls [TClass::GetListOfBases](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/87a998d48803bc207288d90038e60ff148827664/core/meta/src/TClass.cxx#L3620) which does not return all the bases in the full inheritance chain of the class, rather just the direct bases of a class. So in this case:; ```; >>> import ROOT; >>> ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(; ... '''; ... class A {};; ... class B: public A {};; ... class C: public B {};; ... '''); True; >>> c = ROOT.TClass.GetClass(""C""); >>> b = ROOT.TClass.GetClass(""B""); >>> len(c.GetListOfBases()); 1; >>> len(b.GetListOfBases()); 1; ```. In this case, if TClass:GetListOfBases returned a list of size 2 for class `C`, the correct overload would get assigned a higher priority and thus would be chosen at runtime.

The head node already had all the information needed to represent the computation graph locally, split the dataset in logical ranges, reconstruct and execute the graph in the distributed tasks. Taking inspiration from the RLoopManager class, the head node now also handles the execution, since anyway it has a reference to the backend and everything else needed already embedded.

Currently, we have to force it because otherwise we cannot change the defaults for which we want asserts in `RelWithDebInfo`.

I think this is fine since you cannot use `ns` anyway:; ```; root [8] ns::b; ROOT_prompt_8:1:1: error: reference to 'ns' is ambiguous; ns::b; ^; ROOT_prompt_5:1:11: note: candidate found by name lookup is 'ns'; namespace ns { int b = 1; }; ^; ROOT_prompt_3:1:27: note: candidate found by name lookup is 'std::ns'; namespace std { namespace ns { int a = 0; } }; ^; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8828#issuecomment-939752234:226,test,tested,226,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8828#issuecomment-939752234,3,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"Apologies for the brevity before. In my attempts to set the alignment differently on the first and last labels, I found only one value seemed to be set. On trying to make a minimal reproducer, I'm finding that for certain, changing the LabelFont is not working if all labels are not set correctly. ```; python; >>> import ROOT; >>> h = ROOT.TH1D(""h"", """", 5, 0, 5); >>> for bin in range(h.GetXaxis().GetNbins()+1):; ... h.GetXaxis().ChangeLabel(bin, 10*bin, 4*bin, -1, -1, -1, """"); ...; >>> h.Draw(); Info in <TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas>: created default TCanvas with name c1; >>> h = ROOT.TH1D(""h"", """", 5, 0, 5); for bin in range(11):; ... if bin < 2:; ... align = 11; ... elif bin > 7:; ... align = 12; ... else:; ... align = 13; ... h.GetXaxis().ChangeLabel(bin, 15*bin, .1, align, -1, 43, """"); ...; >>> h.Draw(); ```; Produced the attached axis, so the rotations are working, but a separate test suggests that alignments are not when the rotation is different than 0 (setting the rotation to 90 seems to produce identical alignment for all labels, as far as I can tell). Setting the pixel size to e.g. 10, of course, blows up those labels to greater-than-canvas size, they're being interpreted as fractions still. That is actually related to a problem I had a few days ago, accidentally passing fractional instead of integer (>1) values for size when the font precision is changed to absolute scale, but I'm not sure it's worth a warning or error message when it's being set. So, separate from the documentation: what is the appropriate way to find the number of labels? Trying to use the TAxis::GetLabels() method didn't lead me anywhere, maybe there's a good example somewhere though; <img width=""694"" alt=""ChangeLabels"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38217274/161010205-85424185-a64a-4829-992e-1982f16588d5.png"">; ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10279#issuecomment-1084252582:890,test,test,890,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10279#issuecomment-1084252582,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"As a developer and maintainer of Delphes, I am quite happy with TClonesArray. As far as I know, storing TClonesArray in TTree was the fastest and least crash-prone method for all ROOT 5 versions and early ROOT 6 versions. If there is a newer and better method that meets all of the Delphes requirements, I would be interested in seeing and evaluating a few examples. Before doing any pull requests, let's start with something more basic. I think a very basic example showing how to write/read a collection of generated particles to/from a file would be a good starting point. > something that works well with today's software world :-). Newer doesn't always mean better :smiley: Especially in the HEP community where some researchers are still happy with CERNLIB and PAW and do not want to migrate to ROOT :smiley:. At the moment, Delphes maintains compatibility with ROOT 5 and I still receive questions from researches who use Delphes with ROOT 5. So, Delphes is still regularly tested with Ubuntu 14.04, GCC 4.8 and ROOT 5. If the new IO method only works with recent versions of ROOT 6 and requires the change of file format and programming interface, it will be a major change for Delphes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-878284568:981,test,tested,981,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-878284568,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"At a fundamental level the problem is that `RDataFrame` has some homegrown logic to figure out the type of a branch/leaf that is sensible to changes in behavior of `TTree::GetBranch` or `TTree::GetLeaf`. The problem RDataFrame has with this patch is that in the following repro, in which a `TClonesArray` branch is added to a `TTree`, behavior of `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` has changed: before this patch, it would return a nullptr (while `tree.GetBranch(""clonesarray"")` would return the branch; after this patch `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` returns a valid `TLeaf`, so RDataFrame thinks the type of the branch is `leaf->GetTypeName()`, which is `Int_t` for this branch containing `TClonesArray`. I don't think this change in behavior is intentional given that the PR is supposed to fix retrieval of leaves by their full name, not change the behavior of retrieval of leaves with no dot in their names?. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <TClonesArray.h>; #include <TH1D.h>. int main(); {; TClonesArray arr(""TH1D"", 3);; for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {; auto *h = static_cast<TH1D *>(arr.ConstructedAt(i));; h->SetBins(25, 0, 10);; h->Fill(i);; }; TTree t(""t"", ""t"");; t.Branch(""arr"", &arr);; t.Fill();. auto l = t.GetLeaf(""arr"");; if (l == nullptr) {; std::cout << ""leaf is null"" << std::endl; // this is what happens before this PR; return 0;; }. // this prints ""Int_t"", and it is what happens with this PR; std::cout << ""leaf has type name "" << l->GetTypeName() << std::endl;; return 0;; }; ```. P.S.; note that both before and after this patch, `TTree::GetListOfLeaves` does not report `""arr""` as a leaf:. ```; root [4] for (auto e : *t->GetListOfLeaves()) std::cout << e->GetName() << std::endl;; arr_; arr.TH1; arr.TArrayD; ```. P.P.S. it seems the problem is that with this patch `tree->GetLeaf(""arr"")` returns leaf called `""arr_""`:. ```cpp; ~/S/d/getleaf_problem root -l df_readwritetclonesarray.root ; root [0] ; Attaching file df_readwritetclonesarray.root ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615:75,log,logic,75,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615,1,['log'],['logic']
