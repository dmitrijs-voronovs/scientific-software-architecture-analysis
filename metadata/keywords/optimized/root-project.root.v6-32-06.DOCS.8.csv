Energy Efficiency,"ent; out-of-bounds (OOB) memory accesses, which remain a major source of security; vulnerabilities in C. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to eliminate this class of bugs; by turning OOB accesses into deterministic traps. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension offers bounds annotations that programmers can; use to attach bounds to pointers. For example, programmers can add the; ``__counted_by(N)`` annotation to parameter ``ptr``, indicating that the pointer; has ``N`` valid elements:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int *__counted_by(N) ptr, size_t N);. Using this bounds information, the compiler inserts bounds checks on every; pointer dereference, ensuring that the program does not access memory outside; the specified bounds. The compiler requires programmers to provide enough bounds; information so that the accesses can be checked at either run time or compile; time — and it rejects code if it cannot. The most important contribution of ``-fbounds-safety`` is how it reduces the; programmer's annotation burden by reconciling bounds annotations at ABI; boundaries with the use of implicit wide pointers (a.k.a. ""fat"" pointers) that; carry bounds information on local variables without the need for annotations. We; designed this model so that it preserves ABI compatibility with C while; minimizing adoption effort. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension has been adopted on millions of lines of; production C code and proven to work in a consumer operating system setting. The; extension was designed to enable incremental adoption — a key requirement in; real-world settings where modifying an entire project and its dependencies all; at once is often not possible. It also addresses multiple of other practical; challenges that have made existing approaches to safer C dialects difficult to; adopt, offering these properties that make it widely adoptable in practice:. * It is designed to preserve the Application Binary Interface (ABI).; * It interoperates well with plain C code.; * It can be adopted par",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:1233,reduce,reduces,1233,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['reduce'],['reduces']

Each operand in the ``memprof`` metadata attachment describes the profiled; behavior of memory allocated by the associated allocation for a given context.; In the above example, there were 2 profiled contexts, one allocating memory; that was typically cold and one allocating memory that was typically not cold. The format of the metadata describing a context specific profile (e.g.; ``!1`` and ``!3`` above) requires a first operand that is a metadata node; describing the context, followed by a list of string metadata tags describing; the profile behavior (e.g. ``cold`` and ``notcold``) above.

Build the record name (:token:`NameValue`) and create an empty record. 2. Parse the parent classes in the :token:`ParentClassList` from left to; right, visiting each parent class's ancestor classes from top to bottom. a. Add the fields from the parent class to the record.; b. Substitute the template arguments into those fields.; c. Add the parent class to the record's list of inherited classes. 3. Apply any top-level ``let`` bindings to the record. Recall that top-level; bindings only apply to inherited fields. 4. Parse the body of the record. * Add any fields to the record.; * Modify the values of fields according to local ``let`` statements.; * Define any ``defvar`` variables. 5. Make a pass over all the fields to resolve any inter-field references. 6. Add the record to the final record list. Because references between fields are resolved (step 5) after ``let`` bindings are; applied (step 3), the ``let`` statement has unusual power. For example:. .. code-block:: text. class C <int x> {; int Y = x;; int Yplus1 = !add(Y, 1);; int xplus1 = !add(x, 1);; }. let Y = 10 in {; def rec1 : C<5> {; }; }. def rec2 : C<5> {; let Y = 10;; }. In both cases, one where a top-level ``let`` is used to bind ``Y`` and one; where a local ``let`` does the same thing, the results are:. .. code-block:: text. def rec1 { // C; int Y = 10;; int Yplus1 = 11;; int xplus1 = 6;; }; def rec2 { // C; int Y = 10;; int Yplus1 = 11;; int xplus1 = 6;; }. ``Yplus1`` is 11 because the ``let Y`` is performed before the ``!add(Y,; 1)`` is resolved. Use this power wisely. Using Classes as Subroutines; ============================. As described in `Simple values`_, a class can be invoked in an expression; and passed template arguments.

Allocating SGPR arguments on the stack are not supported. 4. No CFI is currently generated. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. .. note::.

If no dynamic stack alignment was performed, the stack allocated arguments; are accessed as negative offsets relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``, and the; local variables and register spill slots are accessed as positive offsets; relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``. 5. Function argument passing is implemented by copying the input physical; registers to virtual registers on entry. The register allocator can spill if; necessary.

If non-default file name; is specified by both the environment variable and the command line option,; the environment variable takes precedence.

Any instance of ``%p`` in that file name will be replaced by the process; ID, so that you can easily distinguish the profile output from multiple; runs. .. code-block:: console. $ LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=""code-%p.profraw"" ./code. The modifier ``%h`` can be used in scenarios where the same instrumented; binary is run in multiple different host machines dumping profile data; to a shared network based storage.

While the use of ``%p`` specifier can reduce the likelihood for the profiles; dumped from different processes to clobber each other, such clobbering can still; happen because of the ``pid`` re-use by the OS.

For example,; a common LLVM paradigm is to name one instruction based on the name of another; instruction with a suffix, for example:. .. code-block:: c++.

Twines can be implicitly constructed as; the result of the plus operator applied to strings (i.e., a C strings, an; ``std::string``, or a ``StringRef``). The twine delays the actual concatenation; of strings until it is actually required, at which point it can be efficiently; rendered directly into a character array. This avoids unnecessary heap; allocation involved in constructing the temporary results of string; concatenation.

Energy Efficiency,"ersonalities (``_except_handler3``,; ``_except_handler4``, and ``__C_specific_handler``). All of them implement; cleanups by calling back into a ""funclet"" contained in the parent function. Funclets, in this context, are regions of the parent function that can be called; as though they were a function pointer with a very special calling convention.; The frame pointer of the parent frame is passed into the funclet either using; the standard EBP register or as the first parameter register, depending on the; architecture. The funclet implements the EH action by accessing local variables; in memory through the frame pointer, and returning some appropriate value,; continuing the EH process. No variables live in to or out of the funclet can be; allocated in registers. The C++ personality also uses funclets to contain the code for catch blocks; (i.e. all user code between the braces in ``catch (Type obj) { ... }``). The; runtime must use funclets for catch bodies because the C++ exception object is; allocated in a child stack frame of the function handling the exception. If the; runtime rewound the stack back to frame of the catch, the memory holding the; exception would be overwritten quickly by subsequent function calls. The use of; funclets also allows ``__CxxFrameHandler3`` to implement rethrow without; resorting to TLS. Instead, the runtime throws a special exception, and then uses; SEH (``__try / __except``) to resume execution with new information in the child; frame. In other words, the successive unwinding approach is incompatible with Visual; C++ exceptions and general purpose Windows exception handling. Because the C++; exception object lives in stack memory, LLVM cannot provide a custom personality; function that uses landingpads. Similarly, SEH does not provide any mechanism; to rethrow an exception or continue unwinding. Therefore, LLVM must use the IR; constructs described later in this document to implement compatible exception; handling.

Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain.

See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as; MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also; causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by; ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent); and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache.

Interactive programming gives programmers the freedom to; explore different scenarios while developing software, writing one expression; at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step, and enabling them to; quickly identify and fix bugs whenever they arise. As an example, the; High-Energy Physics community includes professionals with a variety of; backgrounds, including physicists, nuclear engineers, and software; engineers. Cling allows for interactive data analysis in `ROOT; <https://root.cern/>`_ by giving researchers a way to prototype their C++ code,; allowing them to tailor it to the particular scope of the analysis they want to; pursue on a particular set of data before being added to the main framework. **Interpreted language** is a way to achieve interactive programming. In; statically compiled language, all source code is converted into native machine; code and then executed by the processor before being run. An interpreted; language instead runs through source programs line by line, taking an; executable segment of source code, turning it into machine code, and then; executing it. With this approach, when a change is made by the programmer, the; interpreter will convey it without the need for the entire source code to be; manually compiled. Interpreted languages are flexible, and offer features like; dynamic typing and smaller program size. **Cling** is not an interpreter, it is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that feels; like an interpreter, and allows C++, a language designed to be compiled, to be; interpreted. When using Cling, the programmer benefits from both the power of; C++ language, such as high-performance, robustness, fastness, efficiency,; versatility, and the capability of an interpreter, which allows for interactive; exploration and on-the-fly inspection of the source-code.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst:2010,power,power,2010,interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst,1,['power'],['power']

Unfortunately, this complicated feature comes with a large; set of restrictions designed to bound the lifetime of the argument; memory around the call.

It contains the various pieces of state that are required to coherently; read tokens out of a translation unit. The core interface to the ``Preprocessor`` object (once it is set up) is the; ``Preprocessor::Lex`` method, which returns the next :ref:`Token <Token>` from; the preprocessor stream. There are two types of token providers that the; preprocessor is capable of reading from: a buffer lexer (provided by the; :ref:`Lexer <Lexer>` class) and a buffered token stream (provided by the; :ref:`TokenLexer <TokenLexer>` class). .. _Token:. The Token class; ---------------. The ``Token`` class is used to represent a single lexed token. Tokens are; intended to be used by the lexer/preprocess and parser libraries, but are not; intended to live beyond them (for example, they should not live in the ASTs). Tokens most often live on the stack (or some other location that is efficient; to access) as the parser is running, but occasionally do get buffered up. For; example, macro definitions are stored as a series of tokens, and the C++; front-end periodically needs to buffer tokens up for tentative parsing and; various pieces of look-ahead. As such, the size of a ``Token`` matters. On a; 32-bit system, ``sizeof(Token)`` is currently 16 bytes. Tokens occur in two forms: :ref:`annotation tokens <AnnotationToken>` and; normal tokens. Normal tokens are those returned by the lexer, annotation; tokens represent semantic information and are produced by the parser, replacing; normal tokens in the token stream. Normal tokens contain the following; information:. * **A SourceLocation** --- This indicates the location of the start of the; token. * **A length** --- This stores the length of the token as stored in the; ``SourceBuffer``. For tokens that include them, this length includes; trigraphs and escaped newlines which are ignored by later phases of the; compiler.

Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option.

If an ``AliasSet`` in a loop is not modified, then all; load instructions from that set may be hoisted out of the loop.

Passes; perform the transformations and optimizations that make up the compiler, they; build the analysis results that are used by these transformations, and they; are, above all, a structuring technique for compiler code. All LLVM passes are subclasses of the `Pass; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Pass.html>`_ class, which implement; functionality by overriding virtual methods inherited from ``Pass``. Depending; on how your pass works, you should inherit from the :ref:`ModulePass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-ModulePass>` , :ref:`CallGraphSCCPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-CallGraphSCCPass>`, :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` , or :ref:`LoopPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-LoopPass>`, or :ref:`RegionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegionPass>` classes, which gives the system more; information about what your pass does, and how it can be combined with other; passes. One of the main features of the LLVM Pass Framework is that it; schedules passes to run in an efficient way based on the constraints that your; pass meets (which are indicated by which class they derive from). We start by showing you how to construct a pass, everything from setting up the; code, to compiling, loading, and executing it. After the basics are down, more; advanced features are discussed. .. warning::; This document deals with the legacy pass manager. LLVM uses the new pass; manager for the optimization pipeline (the codegen pipeline; still uses the legacy pass manager), which has its own way of defining; passes.

It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For example, if ``opt`` crashes while optimizing a file, it will identify the; optimization (or combination of optimizations) that causes the crash, and reduce; the file down to a small example which triggers the crash. For detailed case scenarios, such as debugging ``opt``, or one of the LLVM code; generators, see :doc:`HowToSubmitABug`. Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work. Because of this, it may; appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications. ``bugpoint`` is; also designed to trade off programmer time for computer time in the; compiler-debugging process; consequently, it may take a long period of; (unattended) time to reduce a test case, but we feel it is still worth it. Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program. If any; LLVM passes are specified on the command line, it runs these passes on the test; program. If any of the passes crash, or if they produce malformed output (which; causes the verifier to abort), ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_. Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output.

The file is divided into; sections, which correspond to each of the functions with profile; information. The format is described below. It can also be generated from; the binary or gcov formats using the ``llvm-profdata`` tool. 2. Binary encoding. This uses a more efficient encoding that yields smaller; profile files. This is the format generated by the ``create_llvm_prof`` tool; in https://github.com/google/autofdo. 3. GCC encoding. This is based on the gcov format, which is accepted by GCC.

In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option.

Energy Efficiency,"for the current point.; Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and; direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to; compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for; particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than; 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here. After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to; the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by; **`TGeoManager`**`::FindNextDaughterBoundary().` This computes the; distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by; using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in; case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a; simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside; each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step; value is again updated if `step<stepmax` . A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly; overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is; computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account; the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes ""). The global matrix describing the next crossed physical node is; systematically computed in case the value of the proposed step is; negative. In this case, one can subsequently call; `TGeoManager::ComputeNormalFast()` to get the normal vector to the; crossed surface, after propagating the current point with the; `TGeoManager::GetStep()` value.

For this purpose, the header is; checksummed and corruption of the header will be detected when said header is; accessed (note that if the corrupted header is not accessed, the corruption; will remain undetected). The following information is stored in the header:. - the class ID for that chunk, which identifies the region where the chunk; resides for Primary backed allocations, or 0 for Secondary backed allocations;. - the state of the chunk (available, allocated or quarantined);. - the allocation type (malloc, new, new[] or memalign), to detect potential; mismatches in the allocation APIs used;. - the size (Primary) or unused bytes amount (Secondary) for that chunk, which is; necessary for reallocation or sized-deallocation operations;. - the offset of the chunk, which is the distance in bytes from the beginning of; the returned chunk to the beginning of the backend allocation (the ""block"");. - the 16-bit checksum;. This header fits within 8 bytes on all platforms supported, and contributes to a; small overhead for each allocation. The checksum is computed using a CRC32 (made faster with hardware support); of the global secret, the chunk pointer itself, and the 8 bytes of header with; the checksum field zeroed out. It is not intended to be cryptographically; strong. The header is atomically loaded and stored to prevent races. This is important; as two consecutive chunks could belong to different threads.

Therefore, the; overriding design constraint of CodeView is the separation of type information; from other ""symbol"" information so that type information can be efficiently; merged across translation units. Both type information and symbol information is; generally stored as a sequence of records, where each record begins with a; 16-bit record size and a 16-bit record kind. Type information is usually stored in the ``.debug$T`` section of the object; file. All other debug info, such as line info, string table, symbol info, and; inlinee info, is stored in one or more ``.debug$S`` sections. There may only be; one ``.debug$T`` section per object file, since all other debug info refers to; it. If a PDB (enabled by the ``/Zi`` MSVC option) was used during compilation,; the ``.debug$T`` section will contain only an ``LF_TYPESERVER2`` record pointing; to the PDB. When using PDBs, symbol information appears to remain in the object; file ``.debug$S`` sections.

When clang compiles a source file with ``-fcoverage-mapping``, it; generates the mapping information that describes the mapping between the; source ranges and the profiling instrumentation counters.; This information gets embedded into the LLVM IR and conveniently; ends up in the final executable file when the program is linked. 2. It is also used by *llvm-cov* - the mapping information is extracted from an; object file and is used to associate the execution counts (the values of the; profile instrumentation counters), and the source ranges in a file.; After that, the tool is able to generate various code coverage reports; for the program. The coverage mapping format aims to be a ""universal format"" that would be; suitable for usage by any frontend, and not just by Clang. It also aims to; provide the frontend the possibility of generating the minimal coverage mapping; data in order to reduce the size of the IR and object files - for example,; instead of emitting mapping information for each statement in a function, the; frontend is allowed to group the statements with the same execution count into; regions of code, and emit the mapping information only for those regions. Advanced Concepts; =================. The remainder of this guide is meant to give you insight into the way the; coverage mapping format works. The coverage mapping format operates on a per-function level as the; profile instrumentation counters are associated with a specific function.; For each function that requires code coverage, the frontend has to create; coverage mapping data that can map between the source code ranges and; the profile instrumentation counters for that function.

Note that AMD Jaguar implements; three schedulers:. * JALU01 - A scheduler for ALU instructions.; * JFPU01 - A scheduler floating point operations.; * JLSAGU - A scheduler for address generation. The dot-product is a kernel of three floating point instructions (a vector; multiply followed by two horizontal adds). That explains why only the floating; point scheduler appears to be used. A full scheduler queue is either caused by data dependency chains or by a; sub-optimal usage of hardware resources. Sometimes, resource pressure can be; mitigated by rewriting the kernel using different instructions that consume; different scheduler resources. Schedulers with a small queue are less resilient; to bottlenecks caused by the presence of long data dependencies. The scheduler; statistics are displayed by using the command option ``-all-stats`` or; ``-scheduler-stats``. The next table, *Retire Control Unit*, presents a histogram displaying a count,; representing the number of instructions retired on some number of cycles. In; this case, of the 610 simulated cycles, two instructions were retired during the; same cycle 399 times (65.4%) and there were 109 cycles where no instructions; were retired. The retire statistics are displayed by using the command option; ``-all-stats`` or ``-retire-stats``. The last table presented is *Register File statistics*. Each physical register; file (PRF) used by the pipeline is presented in this table. In the case of AMD; Jaguar, there are two register files, one for floating-point registers (JFpuPRF); and one for integer registers (JIntegerPRF). The table shows that of the 900; instructions processed, there were 900 mappings created. Since this dot-product; example utilized only floating point registers, the JFPuPRF was responsible for; creating the 900 mappings.

We also define some umbrella targets (e.g.; ``llvm-libraries`` to install all LLVM libraries); a target can appear in a; different distribution than its umbrella, in which case the target will be; exported by the distribution it appears in (and not the distribution its; umbrella appears in). Set *LLVM_STRICT_DISTRIBUTIONS* to ``On`` if you want to; enforce a target appearing in only one distribution and umbrella distributions; being consistent with target distributions. We strongly encourage looking at ``clang/cmake/caches/MultiDistributionExample.cmake``; as an example of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*.

The constraint list is a comma-separated string, each element containing one or; more constraint codes. For each element in the constraint list an appropriate register or memory; operand will be chosen, and it will be made available to assembly template; string expansion as ``$0`` for the first constraint in the list, ``$1`` for the; second, etc. There are three different types of constraints, which are distinguished by a; prefix symbol in front of the constraint code: Output, Input, and Clobber. The; constraints must always be given in that order: outputs first, then inputs, then; clobbers. They cannot be intermingled. There are also three different categories of constraint codes:. - Register constraint. This is either a register class, or a fixed physical; register. This kind of constraint will allocate a register, and if necessary,; bitcast the argument or result to the appropriate type.; - Memory constraint. This kind of constraint is for use with an instruction; taking a memory operand. Different constraints allow for different addressing; modes used by the target.; - Immediate value constraint. This kind of constraint is for an integer or other; immediate value which can be rendered directly into an instruction. The; various target-specific constraints allow the selection of a value in the; proper range for the instruction you wish to use it with. Output constraints; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Output constraints are specified by an ""``=``"" prefix (e.g. ""``=r``"").

Energy Efficiency,"gpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead. If you would like to stick to; particular crash, you should write check scripts to validate the error; message, see ``-compile-command`` in :doc:`CommandGuide/bugpoint`. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, debugging will go faster; if you manually modify the program or its inputs to reduce the runtime, but; still exhibit the problem. * ``bugpoint`` is extremely useful when working on a new optimization: it helps; track down regressions quickly. To avoid having to relink ``bugpoint`` every; time you change your optimization however, have ``bugpoint`` dynamically load; your optimization with the ``-load`` option. * ``bugpoint`` can generate a lot of output and run for a long period of time.; It is often useful to capture the output of the program to file. For example,; in the C shell, you can run:. .. code-block:: console. $ bugpoint ... |& tee bugpoint.log. to get a copy of ``bugpoint``'s output in the file ``bugpoint.log``, as well; as on your terminal. * ``bugpoint`` cannot debug problems with the LLVM linker. If ``bugpoint``; crashes before you see its ""All input ok"" message, you might try ``llvm-link; -v`` on the same set of input files. If that also crashes, you may be; experiencing a linker bug. * ``bugpoint`` is usefu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:6669,reduce,reduce,6669,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

The *target triple* string consists of a series of identifiers delimited; by the minus sign character ('-'). The canonical forms are:. ::.

This is in contrast to other; schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off; consuming more memory for shorter function prologs and epilogs with fewer; memory accesses. `Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks; on x86_64. Like the previous implementation of ShadowCallStack on x86_64, it is; inherently racy due to the architecture's use of the stack for calls and; returns. Intel `Control-flow Enforcement Technology`_ (CET) is a proposed hardware; extension that would add native support to use a shadow stack to store/check; return addresses at call/return time. Being a hardware implementation, it; would not suffer from race conditions and would not incur the overhead of; function instrumentation, but it does require operating system support. .. _`Return Flow Guard`: https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2016/11/02/return-flow-guard/; .. _`Control-flow Enforcement Technology",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst:1317,consumption,consumption,1317,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,1,['consumption'],['consumption']

RooFit provides; a set of tools/classes to define and evaluate probability density functions; (PDFs), perform maximum likelihood fits, perform statistical tests, etc. ## Proof of Concept: Speeding up RooFit using Automatic Differentiation (AD). RooFit is used to reduce statistical models (functions) to find a set of; parameters that minimize the value of the function.

With the exception of retains done as part of initializing a ``__strong``; parameter variable or reading a ``__weak`` variable, whenever these semantics; call for retaining a value of block-pointer type, it has the effect of a; ``Block_copy``. The optimizer may remove such copies when it sees that the; result is used only as an argument to a call.

Recommended Usage Guidelines; This section describes a few recommendations with running the analyzer.; ALWAYS analyze a project in its ""debug"" configuration; Most projects can be built in a ""debug"" mode that enables assertions.; Assertions are picked up by the static analyzer to prune infeasible paths, which; in some cases can greatly reduce the number of false positives (bogus error; reports) emitted by the tool.; Another option is to use --force-analyze-debug-code flag of; scan-build tool which would enable assertions automatically.; Use verbose output when debugging scan-build; scan-build takes a -v option to emit verbose output about; what it's doing; two -v options emit more information. Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan-build in order to analyze the project.; Example. $ scan-build ./configure; $ scan-build --keep-cc make.

The VM code is NOT guaranteed safe in a java sense. Doing so makes it; basically impossible to support C like languages. Besides that,; certifying a register based language as safe at run time would be a; pretty expensive operation to have to do. Additionally, we would like; to be able to statically eliminate many bounds checks in Java; programs... for example. 2. Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different.

For further information, see the above URL. ## Some useful container classes. ### TObjArray and TClonesArray. The TObjArray class can be used to support an array of objects. The objects need not be of the; same type, but each object must be of a class type that inherits from TObject. We have already; seen a specific example of the use of TObjArray, in the StreamerInfo record, where it is used; to hold an array of TStreamerElement objects, each of which is of a class inheriting from; TStreamerElement, which in turn inherits from TObject. The TClonesArray class is a specialization of the TObjArray class for holding an array; of objects that are all of the same type. The format of a TClonesArray object; is given in \ref tclonesarray. There are two great advantages in the use of TClonesArray over TObjArray when the objects; all will be of the same class:. 1. Memory for the objects will be allocated only once for the entire array, rather; than the per-object allocation for TObjArray. This can be done because all the; objects are the same size.; 2. In the case of TObjArray, the stored objects are written sequentially. However,; in a TClonesArray, by default, each object is split one level deep into its base; class(es) and data members, and each of these members is written sequentially for; all objects in the array before the next member is written. This has two advantages:; 1. Greater compression can be achieved when similar data is consecutive.; 2. The object's data members can easily be split into different TTree branches; (TTrees are discussed below). ### TTree. A TTree is a highly specialized container class for efficient storage and retrieval of user data.; The use of TTrees is discussed in detail in the; [Trees chapter of the Root Manual](https://root.cern/manual/trees/).

Although M will of course solve easy problems faster than complicated; ones, it is not intended for the repeated solution of identically; parametrized problems (such as track fitting in a detector) where a; specialized program will in general be much more efficient. ## Further remarks ##. M was initially written in Fortran around 1975-1980 at CERN by Fred; James @bib-MINUIT. Its main field of usage is statistical data analysis; of experimental data recorded at CERN, but it is also used by people; doing data analysis outside CERN or outside high energy physics (HEP).; In 2002 Fred James started a project aiming to re-implement M in an; object-oriented way using .

Instruction folding; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. *Instruction folding* is an optimization performed during register allocation; that removes unnecessary copy instructions. For instance, a sequence of; instructions such as:. ::. %EBX = LOAD %mem_address; %EAX = COPY %EBX. can be safely substituted by the single instruction:. ::. %EAX = LOAD %mem_address. Instructions can be folded with the; ``TargetRegisterInfo::foldMemoryOperand(...)`` method.

The LLVM infrastructure provides the application developer with three different; register allocators:. * *Fast* --- This register allocator is the default for debug builds. It; allocates registers on a basic block level, attempting to keep values in; registers and reusing registers as appropriate. * *Basic* --- This is an incremental approach to register allocation. Live; ranges are assigned to registers one at a time in an order that is driven by; heuristics. Since code can be rewritten on-the-fly during allocation, this; framework allows interesting allocators to be developed as extensions. It is; not itself a production register allocator but is a potentially useful; stand-alone mode for triaging bugs and as a performance baseline. * *Greedy* --- *The default allocator*. This is a highly tuned implementation of; the *Basic* allocator that incorporates global live range splitting. This; allocator works hard to minimize the cost of spill code. * *PBQP* --- A Partitioned Boolean Quadratic Programming (PBQP) based register; allocator.

Passing strings (the ``StringRef`` and ``Twine`` classes); ---------------------------------------------------------. Although LLVM generally does not do much string manipulation, we do have several; important APIs which take strings. Two important examples are the Value class; -- which has names for instructions, functions, etc. -- and the ``StringMap``; class which is used extensively in LLVM and Clang. These are generic classes, and they need to be able to accept strings which may; have embedded null characters. Therefore, they cannot simply take a ``const; char *``, and taking a ``const std::string&`` requires clients to perform a heap; allocation which is usually unnecessary. Instead, many LLVM APIs use a; ``StringRef`` or a ``const Twine&`` for passing strings efficiently. .. _StringRef:. The ``StringRef`` class; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``StringRef`` data type represents a reference to a constant string (a; character array and a length) and supports the common operations available on; ``std::string``, but does not require heap allocation. It can be implicitly constructed using a C style null-terminated string, an; ``std::string``, or explicitly with a character pointer and length. For; example, the ``StringMap`` find function is declared as:. .. code-block:: c++. iterator find(StringRef Key);. and clients can call it using any one of:. .. code-block:: c++. Map.find(""foo""); // Lookup ""foo""; Map.find(std::string(""bar"")); // Lookup ""bar""; Map.find(StringRef(""\0baz"", 4)); // Lookup ""\0baz"". Similarly, APIs which need to return a string may return a ``StringRef``; instance, which can be used directly or converted to an ``std::string`` using; the ``str`` member function.

Energy Efficiency,"hey are variable length, inefficient to hash and compare when; long, expensive to copy, etc. StringMap is a specialized container designed to; cope with these issues. It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an; arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the; buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff).; The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable; length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the; same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object.; This container guarantees the ""``(char*)(&Value+1)``"" points to the key string; for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache; efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed; when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for; unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),; hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the; table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data; is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair). StringMap also provides query methods that take byte ranges, so it only ever; copies a string if a value is inserted into the table. StringMap iteration order, however, is not guaranteed to be deterministic, so; any uses which require that should instead use a std::map. .. _dss_indexmap:. llvm/ADT/IndexedMap.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. IndexedMap is a specialized container for mapping small dense integers (or; values that can be mapped to small dense integers) to some other type.

Energy Efficiency,"hich deserves a bit of explanation: if a; register class constraint allocates a register which is too small for the value; type operand provided as input, the input value will be split into multiple; registers, and all of them passed to the inline asm. However, this feature is often not as useful as you might think. Firstly, the registers are *not* guaranteed to be consecutive. So, on those; architectures that have instructions which operate on multiple consecutive; instructions, this is not an appropriate way to support them. (e.g. the 32-bit; SparcV8 has a 64-bit load, which instruction takes a single 32-bit register. The; hardware then loads into both the named register, and the next register. This; feature of inline asm would not be useful to support that.). A few of the targets provide a template string modifier allowing explicit access; to the second register of a two-register operand (e.g. MIPS ``L``, ``M``, and; ``D``). On such an architecture, you can actually access the second allocated; register (yet, still, not any subsequent ones). But, in that case, you're still; probably better off simply splitting the value into two separate operands, for; clarity. (e.g. see the description of the ``A`` constraint on X86, which,; despite existing only for use with this feature, is not really a good idea to; use). Indirect inputs and outputs; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Indirect output or input constraints can be specified by the ""``*``"" modifier; (which goes after the ""``=``"" in case of an output). This indicates that the asm; will write to or read from the contents of an *address* provided as an input; argument. (Note that in this way, indirect outputs act more like an *input* than; an output: just like an input, they consume an argument of the call expression,; rather than producing a return value. An indirect output constraint is an; ""output"" only in that the asm is expected to write to the contents of the input; memory location, instead of just read from it).

DWARF mentions; address spaces, for example as an argument to the ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations.; A new section that defines address spaces is added (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-spaces`). A new attribute ``DW_AT_LLVM_address_space`` is added to pointer and reference; types (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-type-modifier-entries`). This allows the compiler; to specify which address space is being used to represent the pointer or; reference type. DWARF uses the concept of an address in many expression operations but does not; define how it relates to address spaces. For example,; ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` pushes the address of an object. Other contexts; implicitly push an address on the stack before evaluating an expression. For; example, the ``DW_AT_use_location`` attribute of the; ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type``. The expression belongs to a source language type; which may apply to objects allocated in different kinds of storage. Therefore,; it is desirable that the expression that uses the address can do so without; regard to what kind of storage it specifies, including the address space of a; memory location description. For example, a pointer to member value may want to; be applied to an object that may reside in any address space.

For pointer types, these builtins operate in terms of the integer; address of the pointer and return a new pointer of the same type (including; qualifiers such as ``const``) with an adjusted address.; When aligning pointers up or down, the resulting value must be within the same; underlying allocation or one past the end (see C17 6.5.6p8, C++ [expr.add]).; This means that arbitrary integer values stored in pointer-type variables must; not be passed to these builtins.

However, by allowing a location description to be a first-class; entry on the DWARF expression stack it becomes possible to compose expressions; containing both values and location descriptions naturally. It allows objects to; be located in any kind of memory address space, in registers, be implicit; values, be undefined, or a composite of any of these. By extending DWARF carefully, all existing DWARF expressions can retain their; current semantic meaning. DWARF has implicit conversions that convert from a; value that represents an address in the default address space to a memory; location description. This can be extended to allow a default address space; memory location description to be implicitly converted back to its address; value. This allows all DWARF Version 5 expressions to retain their same meaning,; while enabling the ability to explicitly create memory location descriptions in; non-default address spaces and generalizing the power of composite location; descriptions to any kind of location description. For those familiar with the definition of location descriptions in DWARF Version; 5, the definitions in these extensions are presented differently, but does in; fact define the same concept with the same fundamental semantics. However, it; does so in a way that allows the concept to extend to support address spaces,; bit addressing, the ability for composite location descriptions to be composed; of any kind of location description, and the ability to support objects located; at multiple places.

Source level debugging uses formatted data that helps a debugger; translate from binary and the state of the machine back to the; source that the programmer wrote. In LLVM we generally use a format; called `DWARF <http://dwarfstd.org>`_. DWARF is a compact encoding; that represents types, source locations, and variable locations. The short summary of this chapter is that we'll go through the; various things you have to add to a programming language to; support debug info, and how you translate that into DWARF. Caveat: For now we can't debug via the JIT, so we'll need to compile; our program down to something small and standalone. As part of this; we'll make a few modifications to the running of the language and; how programs are compiled. This means that we'll have a source file; with a simple program written in Kaleidoscope rather than the; interactive JIT. It does involve a limitation that we can only; have one ""top level"" command at a time to reduce the number of; changes necessary. Here's the sample program we'll be compiling:. .. code-block:: python. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. fib(10). Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. Debug information is a hard problem for a few different reasons - mostly; centered around optimized code. First, optimization makes keeping source; locations more difficult. In LLVM IR we keep the original source location; for each IR level instruction on the instruction. Optimization passes; should keep the source locations for newly created instructions, but merged; instructions only get to keep a single location - this can cause jumping; around when stepping through optimized programs. Secondly, optimization; can move variables in ways that are either optimized out, shared in memory; with other variables, or difficult to track. For the purposes of this; tutorial we're going to avoid optimization (as you'll see with one of the; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst:1427,reduce,reduce,1427,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

To reduce peak memory usage of the compiler, plugins are recommended to run; *before* the main action, which is usually code generation. This is because; having any plugins that run after the codegen action automatically turns off; ``-clear-ast-before-backend``. ``-clear-ast-before-backend`` reduces peak; memory by clearing the Clang AST after generating IR and before running IR; optimizations.

Cling is not thread safe yet, and it will block the execution of the; threads until it has finished executing. #### Asynchronous Actions. Different threads can work simultaneously with the same object. Some; actions can be dangerous. For example, when two threads create a; histogram object, ROOT allocates memory and puts them to the same; collection. If it happens at the same time, the results are; undetermined. To avoid this problem, the user has to synchronize these; actions with:. ``` {.cpp}; TThread::Lock() // Locking the following part of code; ... // Create an object, etc...; TThread::UnLock() // Unlocking; ```. The code between `Lock()` and `UnLock()` will be performed; uninterrupted. No other threads can perform actions or access; objects/collections while it is being executed. The methods; `TThread::Lock() `and **`TThread::UnLock()`** internally use a global; `TMutex` instance for locking. The user may also define their own **`TMutex`** `MyMutex` instance and may; locally protect their asynchronous actions by calling `MyMutex.Lock()` and; `MyMutex.UnLock().`. #### Synchronous Actions: TCondition.

Energy Efficiency,"iler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake.

The layout of the main page coming from THttpServer is very similar to normal JSROOT page.; One could browse existing items and display them. A snapshot of running; server can be seen on the [demo page](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/).

The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer.

After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:. Miscompilation debugger; -----------------------. The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger. It; works by splitting the test program into two pieces, running the optimizations; specified on one piece, linking the two pieces back together, and then executing; the result. It attempts to narrow down the list of passes to the one (or few); which are causing the miscompilation, then reduce the portion of the test; program which is being miscompiled. The miscompilation debugger assumes that; the selected code generator is working properly. Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead.

Here is an example:. ```python; import ROOT; from dask.distributed import Client; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Dask.RDataFrame. # In a Python script the Dask client needs to be initalized in a context; # Jupyter notebooks / Python session don't need this; if __name__ == ""__main__"":; client = Client(""SCHEDULER_ADDRESS""); df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root"", daskclient=client); # Proceed as usual; df.Define(""x"",""someoperation"").Histo1D(""x""); ```. Other notable additions and improvements include:. - Enable triggering multiple distributed computation graphs through `RunGraphs`. This also allows sending both Spark and Dask jobs at the same time through a single function call.; - Greatly reduce distributed tasks processing overhead in TTree-based analyses by refactoring the translation from task metadata to RDataFrame object on the workers.; - Refactor triggering of the computation graph in the distributed tasks, so that it now runs with the Python GIL released. This allows interoperability with frameworks like Dask that run different Python threads along the main processing one.; - Set minimum Python version to use this tool to 3.7. This allows using more modern Python functionality in distributed RDataFrame code and is in line with the Python support provided by Spark and Dask.; - Add support for the following operations:; - `DefinePerSample`; - `HistoND`; - `Redefine`; - Make sure a user-provided `npartitions` parameter to a distributed RDataFrame constructor always takes precedence over the value computed by default.; - Improve support for friend trees in distributed executions, now any kind of friendship layout between the main tree and the friend tree(s) is expected to work.; - Add support for TChain data sources with no tree name an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:11255,reduce,reduce,11255,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Note again, however, that; dependence does not survive a store, so ARC does not guarantee the; continued validity of the return value past the end of the; full-expression. .. _arc.optimization.object_lifetime:. No object lifetime extension; ----------------------------. If, in the formal computation history of the program, an object ``X``; has been deallocated by the time of an observable side-effect, then; ARC must cause ``X`` to be deallocated by no later than the occurrence; of that side-effect, except as influenced by the re-ordering of the; destruction of objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:. Precise lifetime semantics; --------------------------. In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer held in; a ``__strong`` object will be retained for the full formal lifetime of the; object. Objects subject to this invariant have :arc-term:`precise lifetime; semantics`. By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do not have precise; lifetime semantics. Such objects are simply strong references which hold; values of retainable object pointer type, and these values are still fully; subject to the optimizations on values under local control. .. admonition:: Rationale.

In order to determine the; type, we need to get the instance of ``PointerType`` that best captures the; typedef information in the program. If the type of the expression is literally; a ``PointerType``, we can return that, otherwise we have to dig through the; typedefs to find the pointer type. For example, if the subexpression had type; ""``foo*``"", we could return that type as the result. If the subexpression had; type ""``bar``"", we want to return ""``foo*``"" (note that we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one. If not, it returns a null; pointer. This structure is somewhat mystical, but after meditating on it, it will make; sense to you :). .. _QualType:. The ``QualType`` class; ----------------------. The ``QualType`` class is designed as a trivial value class that is small,; passed by-value and is efficient to query. The idea of ``QualType`` is that it; stores the type qualifiers (``const``, ``volatile``, ``restrict``, plus some; extended qualifiers required by language extensions) separately from the types; themselves. ``QualType`` is conceptually a pair of ""``Type*``"" and the bits; for these type qualifiers. By storing the type qualifiers as bits in the conceptual pair, it is extremely; efficient to get the set of qualifiers on a ``QualType`` (just return the field; of the pair), add a type qualifier (which is a trivial constant-time operation; that sets a bit), and remove one or more type qualifiers (just return a; ``QualType`` with the bitfield set to empty). Further, because the bits are stored outside of the type itself, we do not need; to create duplicates of types with different sets of qualifiers (i.e. there is; only a single heap allocated ""``int``"" type: ""``const int``"" and ""``volatile; const int``"" both point to the same heap a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:66610,efficient,efficient,66610,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

As described in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`,; a DWARF expression involving the set of SIMT lanes active on entry to a; subprogram is required. The SIMT active lane mask may be held in a register that; is modified as the subprogram executes. However, its value may be saved on entry; to the subprogram. The Call Frame Information (CFI) already encodes such register saving, so it is; more efficient to provide an operation to return the location of a saved; register than have to generate a loclist to describe the same information.

The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it. Note that using the other stream headers (``<sstream>`` for example) is not; problematic in this regard --- just ``<iostream>``. However, ``raw_ostream``; provides various APIs that are better performing for almost every use than; ``std::ostream`` style APIs. .. note::. New code should always use `raw_ostream`_ for writing, or the; ``llvm::MemoryBuffer`` API for reading files. .. _raw_ostream:. Use ``raw_ostream``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM includes a lightweight, simple, and efficient stream implementation in; ``llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h``, which provides all of the common features of; ``std::ostream``. All new code should use ``raw_ostream`` instead of; ``ostream``. Unlike ``std::ostream``, ``raw_ostream`` is not a template and can be forward; declared as ``class raw_ostream``. Public headers should generally not include; the ``raw_ostream`` header, but use forward declarations and constant references; to ``raw_ostream`` instances. Avoid ``std::endl``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``std::endl`` modifier, when used with ``iostreams`` outputs a newline to; the output stream specified. In addition to doing this, however, it also; flushes the output stream. In other words, these are equivalent:. .. code-block:: c++. std::cout << std::endl;; std::cout << '\n' << std::flush;.

Energy Efficiency,"ing explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s. This reduces; indentation in the body of the file for source editors that indent based on; braces, and keeps the conceptual context cleaner. The general form of this rule; is that any ``.cpp`` file that implements code in any namespace may use that; namespace (and its parents'), but should not use any others.

Energy Efficiency,"ing, the compiler must be able to reason; about whether an instruction can be added to a packet. This decision can be; complex since the compiler has to examine all possible mappings of instructions; to functional units. Therefore to alleviate compilation-time complexity, the; VLIW packetizer parses the instruction classes of a target and generates tables; at compiler build time. These tables can then be queried by the provided; machine-independent API to determine if an instruction can be accommodated in a; packet. How the packetization tables are generated and used; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The packetizer reads instruction classes from a target's itineraries and creates; a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to represent the state of a packet. A DFA; consists of three major elements: inputs, states, and transitions. The set of; inputs for the generated DFA represents the instruction being added to a; packet. The states represent the possible consumption of functional units by; instructions in a packet. In the DFA, transitions from one state to another; occur on the addition of an instruction to an existing packet. If there is a; legal mapping of functional units to instructions, then the DFA contains a; corresponding transition. The absence of a transition indicates that a legal; mapping does not exist and that the instruction cannot be added to the packet. To generate tables for a VLIW target, add *Target*\ GenDFAPacketizer.inc as a; target to the Makefile in the target directory. The exported API provides three; functions: ``DFAPacketizer::clearResources()``,; ``DFAPacketizer::reserveResources(MachineInstr *MI)``, and; ``DFAPacketizer::canReserveResources(MachineInstr *MI)``. These functions allow; a target packetizer to add an instruction to an existing packet and to check; whether an instruction can be added to a packet.

As we'll discuss in upcoming sections, *AD support* can be added using *C++; Code generation*.; These two terms may be used interchangeably in this document, since the term; *Code Generation* better helps visualize the transformation that is enabling; AD support. ## Current Status of Code Generation in RooFit. RooFit is an extensive toolkit.; The initiative to add AD support/ Code Generation has been started, but has; not yet achieved full coverage for the models defined/maintained in RooFit. ## How Clad enables AD support using Source Code Transformation. [Clad] is a C++ plugin for Clang. It implements a technique called Source Code; Transformation to enable AD support. Source Code Transformation takes the source code (that needs to be; differentiated) as the input and generates an output code that represents the; derivative of the input. This output code can be used instead of the input; code for more efficient compilation. For more technical details, please see the following paper:. > [Automatic Differentiation of Binned Likelihoods with RooFit and Clad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02650). ## Overview on RooFit implementation details to access source code transformation AD. In RooFit jargon, what is meant by a ""RooFit class"" is a class inheriting from; RooAbsArg that represents a mathematical function, a PDF, or any other; transformation of inputs that are also represented by RooAbsArg objects.; Almost all final classes deriving from RooAbsArg have RooAbsReal as an; intermediate base class, which is the base class for all RooAbsArg that; represent real-valued nodes in the computation graph.; As such RooFit objects are so prevalent in practice, the names RooAbsArg and; RooAbsReal are used interchangeably in this guide.

A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed.

Energy Efficiency,"intended to improve the performance; of IDE-centric operations such as syntax highlighting and code completion while; a particular source file is being edited by the user. To minimize the amount; of reparsing required after a change to the file, a form of precompiled header; --- called a precompiled *preamble* --- is automatically generated by parsing; all of the headers in the source file, up to and including the last; ``#include``. When only the source file changes (and none of the headers it; depends on), reparsing of that source file can use the precompiled preamble and; start parsing after the ``#include``\ s, so parsing time is proportional to the; size of the source file (rather than all of its includes). However, the; compilation of that translation unit may already use a precompiled header: in; this case, Clang will create the precompiled preamble as a chained precompiled; header that refers to the original precompiled header. This drastically; reduces the time needed to serialize the precompiled preamble for use in; reparsing. Chained precompiled headers get their name because each precompiled header can; depend on one other precompiled header, forming a chain of dependencies. A; translation unit will then include the precompiled header that starts the chain; (i.e., nothing depends on it). This linearity of dependencies is important for; the semantic model of chained precompiled headers, because the most-recent; precompiled header can provide information that overrides the information; provided by the precompiled headers it depends on, just like a header file; ``B.h`` that includes another header ``A.h`` can modify the state produced by; parsing ``A.h``, e.g., by ``#undef``'ing a macro defined in ``A.h``.

This library is compiled multiple times for different [vector instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and the optimal code is executed during runtime, as a result of an automatic hardware detection mechanism that this library contains. **As a result, fits can benefit by a speedup of 3x-16x.**. As of ROOT v6.26, RooBatchComputes also provides multithread and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) instances of the computation functions, resulting in even greater improvements for fitting times. ### How to use; This library is an internal component of RooFit, so users are not supposed to actively interact with it. Instead, they can benefit from significantly faster times for fitting by calling `fitTo()` and providing a `BatchMode(""cpu"")` or a `BatchMode(""cuda"")` option.; ``` {.cpp}; // fit using the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cpu""));. // fit using the CUDA library along with the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cuda""));; ```; **Note: In case the system does not support vector instructions, the `RooBatchCompute::Cpu` option is guaranteed to work properly by using a generic CPU library. In contrast, users must first make sure that their system supports CUDA in order to use the `RooBatchCompute::Cuda` option. If this is not the case, an exception will be thrown.**. If `""cuda""` is selected, RooFit will launch CUDA kernels for computing likelihoods and potentially other intense computations. At the same time, the most efficient CPU library loaded will also handle parts of the computations in parallel with the GPU (or potentially, if it's faster, all of them), thus gaining full advantage of the available hardware.

The BitVector container provides a dynamic size set of bits for manipulation.; It supports individual bit setting/testing, as well as set operations.

The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed. It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare.

The term ""parent class"" can refer to a class that is a parent of another; class, and also to a class from which a concrete record inherits. This; nonstandard use of the term arises because TableGen treats classes and; concrete records similarly. A backend processes some subset of the concrete records built by the; TableGen parser and emits the output files. These files are usually C++; ``.inc`` files that are included by the programs that require the data in; those records. However, a backend can produce any type of output files. For; example, it could produce a data file containing messages tagged with; identifiers and substitution parameters. In a complex use case such as the; LLVM code generator, there can be many concrete records and some of them can; have an unexpectedly large number of fields, resulting in large output files. In order to reduce the complexity of TableGen files, classes are used to; abstract out groups of record fields. For example, a few classes may; abstract the concept of a machine register file, while other classes may; abstract the instruction formats, and still others may abstract the; individual instructions. TableGen allows an arbitrary hierarchy of classes,; so that the abstract classes for two concepts can share a third superclass that; abstracts common ""sub-concepts"" from the two original concepts. In order to make classes more useful, a concrete record (or another class); can request a class as a parent class and pass *template arguments* to it.; These template arguments can be used in the fields of the parent class to; initialize them in a custom manner. That is, record or class ``A`` can; request parent class ``S`` with one set of template arguments, while record or class; ``B`` can request ``S`` with a different set of arguments.

This utility uses page-granular lazy initialization; when the element is accessed. When the number of used pages is small; significant memory savings can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used). Moreover, while retaining the order of the elements based on their insertion; index, like a vector, iterating over the elements via ``begin()`` and ``end()``; is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``.

Indirect output or input constraints can be specified by the ""``*``"" modifier; (which goes after the ""``=``"" in case of an output). This indicates that the asm; will write to or read from the contents of an *address* provided as an input; argument. (Note that in this way, indirect outputs act more like an *input* than; an output: just like an input, they consume an argument of the call expression,; rather than producing a return value. An indirect output constraint is an; ""output"" only in that the asm is expected to write to the contents of the input; memory location, instead of just read from it). This is most typically used for memory constraint, e.g. ""``=*m``"", to pass the; address of a variable as a value. It is also possible to use an indirect *register* constraint, but only on output; (e.g. ""``=*r``""). This will cause LLVM to allocate a register for an output; value normally, and then, separately emit a store to the address provided as; input, after the provided inline asm. (It's not clear what value this; functionality provides, compared to writing the store explicitly after the asm; statement, and it can only produce worse code, since it bypasses many; optimization passes. I would recommend not using it.). Call arguments for indirect constraints must have pointer type and must specify; the :ref:`elementtype <attr_elementtype>` attribute to indicate the pointer; element type. Clobber constraints; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". A clobber constraint is indicated by a ""``~``"" prefix. A clobber does not; consume an input operand, nor generate an output. Clobbers cannot use any of the; general constraint code letters -- they may use only explicit register; constraints, e.g. ""``~{eax}``"".

Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``.

The size of a dispatch group depends on the availability of the simulated; hardware resources. The processor dispatch width defaults to the value; of the ``IssueWidth`` in LLVM's scheduling model. An instruction can be dispatched if:. * The size of the dispatch group is smaller than processor's dispatch width.; * There are enough entries in the reorder buffer.; * There are enough physical registers to do register renaming.; * The schedulers are not full.

Users can limit the number of physical registers that are; globally available for register renaming by using the command option; ``-register-file-size``. A value of zero for this option means *unbounded*. By; knowing how many registers are available for renaming, the tool can predict; dispatch stalls caused by the lack of physical registers.

Energy Efficiency,"itoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROOT, one should add ""+"" sign at the end of the file name. Of course, it only could work for small files. If somebody still wants to use monitoring of data from ROOT files, could try link like:. - <https://root.cern/js/latest/?nobrowser&file=../files/hsimple.root+&item=hpx;1&monitoring=2000>. In this particular case, the histogram is not changing. ## JSROOT API. JSROOT can be used in arbitrary HTML pages to display data, produced with or without ROOT-based applications. Many different examples of JSROOT API usage can be found on [JSROOT API examples](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm) page. ### Import JSROOT functionality.

It does meet the predicate for this rule; as the type is smaller than the ``s32`` and this rule instructs the legalizer; to change type 0 to ``s32``. It then restarts from the top. This time it does; satisfy ``.legalFor()`` and the resulting output is::. %3:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %0:_(s7); %4:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %1:_(s7); %5:_(s32) = G_ADD %3:_(s32), %4:_(s32); %2:_(s7) = G_TRUNC %5:_(s32). where the ``G_ADD`` is legal and the other instructions are scheduled for; processing by the legalizer.

There are two types of bad cast that may be forbidden: bad casts; from a base class to a derived class (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-derived-cast``), and bad casts from a pointer of; type ``void*`` or another unrelated type (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-unrelated-cast``). The difference between these two types of casts is that the first is defined; by the C++ standard to produce an undefined value, while the second is not; in itself undefined behavior (it is well defined to cast the pointer back; to its original type) unless the object is uninitialized and the cast is a; ``static_cast`` (see C++14 [basic.life]p5). If a program as a matter of policy forbids the second type of cast, that; restriction can normally be enforced. However it may in some cases be necessary; for a function to perform a forbidden cast to conform with an external API; (e.g. the ``allocate`` member function of a standard library allocator).

To reduce the very large number of new and delete calls in large loops; like this (O(100000) x O(10000) times new/delete):. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray a(10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); a[i] = new TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Delete();; }; ```. You better use a **`TClonesArray`** which reduces the number of; new/delete calls to only O(10000):. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray a(""TTrack"", 10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); TTrack *track = (Track*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Clear(); // Or Clear(""C"") if the track objects must be returned (via Track::Clear) to a default state.; }; ```. Considering that a pair of new/delete calls on average cost about 70 ms,; O(109) new/deletes will save about 19 hours.

The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update. Commit ``UM8``; updates a submodule of local project ``myproj``. The tool ``zip-downstream-fork.py`` at; https://github.com/greened/llvm-git-migration/tree/zip can be used to; convert the umbrella history into a monorepo-based history with; commits in the order implied by submodule updates::.

The trees in the ``L*1``; commits represent merges from upstream. These result in edges from; the ``U*`` commits to their corresponding rewritten ``L*1`` commits.; The ``L*2`` commits did not do any merges from upstream. Note that the merge from ``U2`` to ``Lclang1`` appears redundant, but; if, say, ``U3`` changed some files in upstream clang, the ``Lclang1``; commit appearing after the ``Llld1`` commit would actually represent a; clang tree *earlier* in the upstream clang history.

However,; programmers typically use `coroutine` to refer to an individual instance.; For example:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<Task> Coros; // Task is a coroutine type.; for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++); Coros.push_back(CoroTask()); // CoroTask is a coroutine function, which; // would return a coroutine type 'Task'. In practice, we typically say ""`Coros` contains 3 coroutines"" in the above; example, though this is not strictly correct. More technically, this should; say ""`Coros` contains 3 coroutine instances"" or ""Coros contains 3 coroutine; objects."". In this document, we follow the common practice of using `coroutine` to refer; to an individual `coroutine instance`, since the terms `coroutine instance` and; `coroutine object` aren't sufficiently defined in this case. coroutine frame; ---------------. The C++ Standard uses `coroutine state` to describe the allocated storage. In; the compiler, we use `coroutine frame` to describe the generated data structure; that contains the necessary information. The structure of coroutine frames; =================================. The structure of coroutine frames is defined as:. .. code-block:: c++. struct {; void (*__r)(); // function pointer to the `resume` function; void (*__d)(); // function pointer to the `destroy` function; promise_type; // the corresponding `promise_type`; ... // Any other needed information; }. In the debugger, the function's name is obtainable from the address of the; function. And the name of `resume` function is equal to the name of the; coroutine function. So the name of the coroutine is obtainable once the; address of the coroutine is known. Print promise_type; ==================.

Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target.

The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------. The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and; quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors.

This stage; produces the initial code for the program in the target instruction set, then; makes use of virtual registers in SSA form and physical registers that; represent any required register assignments due to target constraints or; calling conventions. This step turns the LLVM code into a DAG of target; instructions. 2. `Scheduling and Formation`_ --- This phase takes the DAG of target; instructions produced by the instruction selection phase, determines an; ordering of the instructions, then emits the instructions as :raw-html:`<tt>`; `MachineInstr`_\s :raw-html:`</tt>` with that ordering. Note that we; describe this in the `instruction selection section`_ because it operates on; a `SelectionDAG`_. 3. `SSA-based Machine Code Optimizations`_ --- This optional stage consists of a; series of machine-code optimizations that operate on the SSA-form produced by; the instruction selector.

A sorted vector; (where you don't delete duplicate entries) or some other approach is almost; always better. .. _ds_map:.

Also:. * `TPluginManager` was made thread-safe [ROOT-7927].; * On MacOSX, backtraces are now generated without external tools [ROOT-6667].; * The set of include paths considered by the interpreter has been reduced to the bare minimum. ### Containers. * A pseudo-container (generator) was created, `ROOT::TSeq<T>`.

Add a new mode for `TClass::SetCanSplit` (2) which indicates that this class and any derived class should not be split. This included a rework the mechanism checking the base classes. Instead of using `InheritsFrom`, which lead in some cases, including the case where the class derived from an STL collection, to spurrious autoparsing (to look at the base class of the collection!), we use a custom walk through the tree of base classes that checks their value of `fCanSplit`.

Boolean vectors; are intended, though not guaranteed, to map to vector mask registers. The size; parameter of a boolean vector type is the number of bits in the vector. The; boolean vector is dense and each bit in the boolean vector is one vector; element. The semantics of boolean vectors borrows from C bit-fields with the following; differences:. * Distinct boolean vectors are always distinct memory objects (there is no; packing).; * Only the operators `?:`, `!`, `~`, `|`, `&`, `^` and comparison are allowed on; boolean vectors.; * Casting a scalar bool value to a boolean vector type means broadcasting the; scalar value onto all lanes (same as general ext_vector_type).; * It is not possible to access or swizzle elements of a boolean vector; (different than general ext_vector_type). The size and alignment are both the number of bits rounded up to the next power; of two, but the alignment is at most the maximum vector alignment of the; target. Vector Literals; ---------------.

For the ``ELSE``; region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region since the ``THEN`` region has completed. The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition.

For a top-level branch the meaning of addr is as follows:. If addr is zero, then we allocate a branch object; internally and the branch is the owner of the allocated; object, not the caller. However the caller may obtain; a pointer to the branch object with GetObject(). Example:. branch->SetAddress(0);; Event* event = branch->GetObject();; ... Do some work. If addr is not zero, but the pointer addr points at is; zero, then we allocate a branch object and set the passed; pointer to point at the allocated object. The caller; owns the allocated object and is responsible for deleting; it when it is no longer needed. Example:. Event* event = 0;; branch->SetAddress(&event);; ... Do some work.; delete event;; event = 0;. If addr is not zero and the pointer addr points at is; also not zero, then the caller has allocated a branch; object and is asking us to use it.

It may be possible to use existing DWARF to incrementally build the composite; location description, possibly using the DWARF operations for control flow to; create a loop. However, for the AMDGPU that would require loop iteration of 64.; A concern is that the resulting DWARF would have a significant size and would be; reasonably common as it is needed for every vector register that is spilled in a; function. AMDGPU can have up to 512 vector registers. Another concern is the; time taken to evaluate such non-trivial expressions repeatedly. To avoid these issues, a composite location description that can be created as a; masked select is proposed. In addition, an operation that creates a composite; location description that is a vector on another location description is needed.; These operations generate the composite location description using a single; DWARF operation that combines all lanes of the vector in one step.

All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together.

The ``-basic-aa`` pass is an aggressive local analysis that *knows* many; important facts:. * Distinct globals, stack allocations, and heap allocations can never alias.; * Globals, stack allocations, and heap allocations never alias the null pointer.; * Different fields of a structure do not alias.; * Indexes into arrays with statically differing subscripts cannot alias.; * Many common standard C library functions `never access memory or only read; memory`_.; * Pointers that obviously point to constant globals ""``pointToConstantMemory``"".; * Function calls can not modify or references stack allocations if they never; escape from the function that allocates them (a common case for automatic; arrays). The ``-globalsmodref-aa`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This pass implements a simple context-sensitive mod/ref and alias analysis for; internal global variables that don't ""have their address taken"". If a global; does not have its address taken, the pass knows that no pointers alias the; global. This pass also keeps track of functions that it knows never access; memory or never read memory. This allows certain optimizations (e.g. GVN) to; eliminate call instructions entirely. The real power of this pass is that it provides context-sensitive mod/ref; information for call instructions. This allows the optimizer to know that calls; to a function do not clobber or read the value of the global, allowing loads and; stores to be eliminated. .. note::.

Upon entry to this block, the current state; of the autorelease pool is captured. When the block is exited normally,; whether by fallthrough or directed control flow (such as ``return`` or; ``break``), the autorelease pool is restored to the saved state, releasing all; the objects in it. When the block is exited with an exception, the pool is not; drained. ``@autoreleasepool`` may be used in non-ARC translation units, with equivalent; semantics. A program is ill-formed if it refers to the ``NSAutoreleasePool`` class. .. admonition:: Rationale. Autorelease pools are clearly important for the compiler to reason about, but; it is far too much to expect the compiler to accurately reason about control; dependencies between two calls. It is also very easy to accidentally forget; to drain an autorelease pool when using the manual API, and this can; significantly inflate the process's high-water-mark.

Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation.

The `loop` blocks represents the body of the coroutine. The `coro.suspend`_; intrinsic in combination with the following switch indicates what happens to; control flow when a coroutine is suspended (default case), resumed (case 0) or; destroyed (case 1). Coroutine Transformation; ------------------------. One of the steps of coroutine lowering is building the coroutine frame. The; def-use chains are analyzed to determine which objects need be kept alive across; suspend points. In the coroutine shown in the previous section, use of virtual register; `%inc` is separated from the definition by a suspend point, therefore, it; cannot reside on the stack frame since the latter goes away once the coroutine; is suspended and control is returned back to the caller. An i32 slot is; allocated in the coroutine frame and `%inc` is spilled and reloaded from that; slot as needed. We also store addresses of the resume and destroy functions so that the; `coro.resume` and `coro.destroy` intrinsics can resume and destroy the coroutine; when its identity cannot be determined statically at compile time. For our; example, the coroutine frame will be:. .. code-block:: llvm. %f.frame = type { ptr, ptr, i32 }. After resume and destroy parts are outlined, function `f` will contain only the; code responsible for creation and initialization of the coroutine frame and; execution of the coroutine until a suspend point is reached:. .. code-block:: llvm. define ptr @f(i32 %n) {; entry:; %id = call token @llvm.coro.id(i32 0, ptr null, ptr null, ptr null); %alloc = call noalias ptr @malloc(i32 24); %frame = call noalias ptr @llvm.coro.begin(token %id, ptr %alloc); %1 = getelementptr %f.frame, ptr %frame, i32 0, i32 0; store ptr @f.resume, ptr %1; %2 = getelementptr %f.frame, ptr %frame, i32 0, i32 1; store ptr @f.destroy, pt",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst:14251,allocate,allocated,14251,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

Several tweaks to if and when, resources held by the global ROOT object (TROOT, TApplication) are deleted. When the default TApplication is replaced by a user provide TApplication, do not call EndOfProcessCleanups and co. and thus do not delete TFiles, TSockets or TColors that have already been created. In EndOfProcessCleanups, we now delete the objects held in TROOT's TDirectory part. If the libCling library is unloaded, this now induces an immediate tear down of the ROOT resources; consequently objects might be deleted sooner in the process tear down process on some platforms. TObject instances allocated as part of an array and made part of a collection, as for example the TCanvas instances into the global list of instances, are not longer deleted if the content of the collection is deleted. Technically the element of the array are now treated by collections as if they have been allocated on the stack. This fixes the issue described at [ROOT-7846]. ### Code Cleanups.

Check all of your preconditions and; assumptions, you never know when a bug (not necessarily even yours) might be; caught early by an assertion, which reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");.

At call sites, the compiler will strengthen the alignment requirements by; using a different rotate count.

Padding to Powers of 2; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Of course, this alignment scheme works best if the address points are; in fact aligned correctly. To make this more likely to happen, we insert; padding between virtual tables that in many cases aligns address points to; a power of 2. Specifically, our padding aligns virtual tables to the next; highest power of 2 bytes; because address points for specific base classes; normally appear at fixed offsets within the virtual table, this normally; has the effect of aligning the address points as well. This scheme introduces tradeoffs between decreased space overhead for; instructions and bit vectors and increased overhead in the form of padding. We; therefore limit the amount of padding so that we align to no more than 128; bytes. This number was found experimentally to provide a good tradeoff. Eliminating Bit Vector Checks for All-Ones Bit Vectors; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

When MCJIT::finalizeObject is called, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations. This function will attempt to locate any; external symbols and then apply all relocations for the object. External symbols are resolved by calling the memory manager's; getPointerToNamedFunction method. The memory manager will return the; address of the requested symbol in the target address space. (Note, this; may not be a valid pointer in the host process.) RuntimeDyld will then; iterate through the list of relocations it has stored which are associated; with this symbol and invoke the resolveRelocation method which, through an; format-specific implementation, will apply the relocation to the loaded; section memory. Next, RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations iterates through the list of; sections and for each section iterates through a list of relocations that; have been saved which reference that symbol and call resolveRelocation for; each entry in this list. The relocation list here is a list of; relocations for which the symbol associated with the relocation is located; in the section associated with the list. Each of these locations will; have a target location at which the relocation will be applied that is; likely located in a different section. .. image:: MCJIT-resolve-relocations.png. Once relocations have been applied as described above, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::getEHFrameSection, and if a non-zero result is returned; passes the section data to the memory manager's registerEHFrames method.; This allows the memory manager to call any desired target-specific; functions, such as registering the EH frame information with a debugger.

When deciding between creating a type hierarchy (with either tagged or virtual; dispatch) and using templates or concepts-based polymorphism, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code.

The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-mca` is a performance analysis tool that uses information; available in LLVM (e.g. scheduling models) to statically measure the performance; of machine code in a specific CPU. Performance is measured in terms of throughput as well as processor resource; consumption. The tool currently works for processors with a backend for which; there is a scheduling model available in LLVM. The main goal of this tool is not just to predict the performance of the code; when run on the target, but also help with diagnosing potential performance; issues. Given an assembly code sequence, :program:`llvm-mca` estimates the Instructions; Per Cycle (IPC), as well as hardware resource pressure. The analysis and; reporting style were inspired by the IACA tool from Intel. For example, you can compile code with clang, output assembly, and pipe it; directly into :program:`llvm-mca` for analysis:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. Or for Intel syntax:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -masm=intel -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. (:program:`llvm-mca` detects Intel syntax by the presence of an `.intel_syntax`; directive at the beginning of the input. By default its output syntax matches; that of its input.). Scheduling models are not just used to compute instruction latencies and; throughput, but also to understand what processor resources are available; and how to simulate them. By design, the quality of the analysis conducted by :program:`llvm-mca` is; inevitably affected by the quality of the scheduling models in LLVM.

LLVM-Reduce is a useful tool for reducing the size and ; complexity of LLVM test cases, making it easier to identify and debug issues in ; the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

ARC must perform special operations when initializing an object and; when destroying it. In many common situations, ARC knows when an; object is created and when it is destroyed and can ensure that these; operations are performed correctly. Otherwise, however, ARC requires; programmer cooperation to establish its initialization invariants; because it is infeasible for ARC to dynamically infer whether they; are intact. For example, there is no syntactic difference in C between; an assignment that is intended by the programmer to initialize a variable; and one that is intended to replace the existing value stored there,; but ARC must perform one operation or the other. ARC chooses to always; assume that objects are initialized (except when it is in charge of; initializing them) because the only workable alternative would be to; ban all code patterns that could potentially be used to access; uninitialized memory, and that would be too limiting. In practice,; this is rarely a problem because programmers do not generally need to; work with objects for which the requirements are not handled; automatically. Note that dynamically-allocated Objective-C++ arrays of; nontrivially-ownership-qualified type are not ABI-compatible with non-ARC; code because the non-ARC code will consider the element type to be POD.; Such arrays that are ``new[]``'d in ARC translation units cannot be; ``delete[]``'d in non-ARC translation units and vice-versa. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.pass_by_writeback:.

However the caller may obtain; a pointer to the branch object with GetObject(). Example:. branch->SetAddress(0);; Event* event = branch->GetObject();; ... Do some work. If addr is not zero, but the pointer addr points at is; zero, then we allocate a branch object and set the passed; pointer to point at the allocated object.

Usage; -------. ``cppyy`` does not use Numba extension hooks to minimize accidental; dependencies.; Instead, it requires that the extensions are loaded explicitly by any code; that uses it::. import cppyy.numba_ext. After that, Numba is able to trace ``cppyy`` bound code when applying the; usual ``numba.njit`` decorator.

Examples; --------. The following, non-exhaustive, set of examples gives an idea of the; current level of support.; More examples can be found in the `test suite`_. C++ free (global) functions can be called and overloads will be selected, or; a template will be instantiated, based on the provided types.; Exact type matches are fully supported, there is some support for typedefs; add implicit conversions for builtin types, there is no support for; conversions of custom types or default arguments. - **Basic usage**: To use ``cppyy`` in Numba JITed code, simply import; ``cppyy.numba_ext``, after which further use is transparent and the same; as when otherwise using ``cppyy`` in Python.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import numba; >>> import cppyy; >>> import cppyy.numba_ext # enables numba to work with cppyy; >>> import math; >>> @numba.jit(nopython=True); ... def cpp_sqrt(x):; ... return cppyy.gbl.sqrt(x) # direct use, no extr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:2958,reduce,reduce,2958,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Instead, the same functionality could be achieved with TableGen and; some support from the .td files for a fraction of maintenance cost. ``InstrMapping`` Class Overview; ===============================. TableGen uses relationship models to map instructions with each other. These; models are described using ``InstrMapping`` class as a base. Each model sets; various fields of the ``InstrMapping`` class such that they can uniquely; describe all the instructions using that model. TableGen parses all the relation; models and uses the information to construct relation tables which relate; instructions with each other. These tables are emitted in the; ``XXXInstrInfo.inc`` file along with the functions to query them. Following; is the definition of ``InstrMapping`` class defined in Target.td file:. .. code-block:: text. class InstrMapping {; // Used to reduce search space only to the instructions using this; // relation model.; string FilterClass;. // List of fields/attributes that should be same for all the instructions in; // a row of the relation table.

TableGen files have no real meaning without a backend. The default operation; when running ``*-tblgen`` is to print the information in a textual format, but; that's only useful for debugging the TableGen files themselves. The power; in TableGen is, however, to interpret the source files into an internal; representation that can be generated into anything you want. Current usage of TableGen is to create huge include files with tables that you; can either include directly (if the output is in the language you're coding),; or be used in pre-processing via macros surrounding the include of the file. Direct output can be used if the backend already prints a table in C format; or if the output is just a list of strings (for error and warning messages).; Pre-processed output should be used if the same information needs to be used; in different contexts (like Instruction names), so your backend should print; a meta-information list that can be shaped into different compile-time formats.

Clang works by taking the source language (e.g. C++) and translating it; into an intermediate representation that is then received by the compiler back; end (i.e., the LLVM backend). Its library-based architecture makes it relatively; easy to adapt Clang and build new tools based on it. Cling inherits a number of; features from LLVM and Clang, such as: fast compiling and low memory use,; efficient C++ parsing, extremely clear and concise diagnostics, Just-In-Time; compilation, pluggable optimizers, and support for `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_; extensions. Interpreters allow for exploration of software development at the rate of human; thought. Nevertheless, interpreter code can be slower than compiled code due to; the fact that translating code at run time adds to the overhead and therefore; causes the execution speed to be slower. This issue is overcome by exploiting; the *Just-In-Time* (`JIT; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation>`_) compilation method,; which allows an efficient memory management (for example, by evaluating whether; a certain part of the source code is executed often, and then compile this part,; therefore reducing the overall execution time). With the JIT approach, the developer types the code in Cling's command; prompt. The input code is then lowered to Clang, where is compiled and; eventually transformed in order to attach specific behavior. Clang compiles then; the input into an AST representation, that is then lowered to LLVM IR, an; `intermediate language; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language>`_ that is not; understood by the computer. LLVM’s just-in-time compilation infrastructure; translates then the intermediate code into machine language (eg. Intel x86 or; NVPTX) when required for use.

This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Toolchains**. The gcc driver has no direct understanding of tool chains. Each gcc; binary roughly corresponds to the information which is embedded; inside a single ToolChain. The clang driver is intended to be portable and support complex; compilation environments. All platform and tool chain specific code; should be protected behind either abstract or well defined interfaces; (such as whether the platform supports use as a driver driver).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:15869,efficient,efficient,15869,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"maller; changes increases the odds that any of the work will be committed to the main; repository. To address these problems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we; require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive; change. Some tips:. * Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are; required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc). These; sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,; independently of that work. * The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of; changes if possible. Once this is done, define the first increment and get; consensus on what the end goal of the change is. * Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a; planned series of changes that works towards the development goal. * Each change should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your work; (into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the chance; that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments also; facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base. * Often, an independent precursor to a big change is to add a new API and slowly; migrate clients to use the new API. Each change to use the new API is often; ""obvious"" and can be committed without review. Once the new API is in place; and used, it is much easier to replace the underlying implementation of the; API. This implementation change is logically separate from the API; change. If you are interested in making a large change, and this scares you, please make; sure to first `discuss the change/gather consensus`_ then ask about the best way; to go about making the change.

An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate. For example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rr8W GR16:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rm8W GR16:$dst, i8mem:$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr8 GR32:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr16 GR32:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr8 GR64:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr16 GR64:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr32 GR64:$dst, GR32 :$src)>;. This shows a powerful example of the instruction aliases, matching the same; mnemonic in multiple different ways depending on what operands are present in; the assembly. The result of instruction aliases can include operands in a; different order than the destination instruction, and can use an input multiple; times, for example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""clrb $reg"", (XOR8rr GR8 :$reg, GR8 :$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrw $reg"", (XOR16rr GR16:$reg, GR16:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrl $reg"", (XOR32rr GR32:$reg, GR32:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrq $reg"", (XOR64rr GR64:$reg, GR64:$reg)>;. This example also shows that tied operands are only listed once. In the X86; backend, XOR8rr has two input GR8's and one output GR8 (where an input is tied; to the output). InstAliases take a flattened operand list without duplicates; for tied operands. The result of an instruction alias can also use immediates; and fixed physical registers which are added as simple immediate operands in the; result, for example:. ::. // Fixed Immediate operand.; def : InstAlias<""aad"", (AAD8i8 10)>;. // Fixe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:84202,power,powerful,84202,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['power'],['powerful']

Energy Efficiency,"mca` uses that information to initialize register; file descriptors. Users can limit the number of physical registers that are; globally available for register renaming by using the command option; ``-register-file-size``. A value of zero for this option means *unbounded*. By; knowing how many registers are available for renaming, the tool can predict; dispatch stalls caused by the lack of physical registers. The number of reorder buffer entries consumed by an instruction depends on the; number of micro-opcodes specified for that instruction by the target scheduling; model. The reorder buffer is responsible for tracking the progress of; instructions that are ""in-flight"", and retiring them in program order. The; number of entries in the reorder buffer defaults to the value specified by field; `MicroOpBufferSize` in the target scheduling model.

In this tutorial we'll assume that it is okay to use; this as a way to show some interesting parsing techniques. At the end of this tutorial, we'll run through an example Kaleidoscope; application that `renders the Mandelbrot set <#kicking-the-tires>`_. This gives an; example of what you can build with Kaleidoscope and its feature set. User-defined Operators: the Idea; ================================. The ""operator overloading"" that we will add to Kaleidoscope is more; general than in languages like C++. In C++, you are only allowed to; redefine existing operators: you can't programmatically change the; grammar, introduce new operators, change precedence levels, etc. In this; chapter, we will add this capability to Kaleidoscope, which will let the; user round out the set of operators that are supported. The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this; is to show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser.; Thus far, the parser we have been implementing uses recursive descent; for most parts of the grammar and operator precedence parsing for the; expressions. See `Chapter 2 <LangImpl02.html>`_ for details. By; using operator precedence parsing, it is very easy to allow; the programmer to introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar; is dynamically extensible as the JIT runs. The two specific features we'll add are programmable unary operators; (right now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as; binary operators. An example of this is:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary ""logical or"", (note that it does not ""short circuit""); def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary= 9 (LHS RH",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst:1903,power,power,1903,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,1,['power'],['power']

The processing of n-tuples via a selector function of type `TSelector`; through `TChain::Process()`, as described at the end of the previous; section, offers an additional advantage in particular for very large; data sets: on distributed systems or multi-core architectures, portions; of data can be processed in parallel, thus significantly reducing the; execution time. On modern computers with multi-core CPUs or; hardware-threading enabled, this allows a much faster turnaround of; analyses, since all the available CPU power is used. On distributed systems, a PROOF server and worker nodes have to be set; up, as described in detail in the ROOT documentation. On a single; computer with multiple cores, `PROOF lite` can be used instead.

Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations.

It’s worth noting that the input file; would be passed as a parameter to the test, similar how `-compile-custom`; currently operates. ### Implementation; The tool would behave similar to CReduce’s functionality in that it would have a; list of passes that try to minimize the given test-case. We should be able to; modularize the tool’s behavior, as well as making it easier to maintain and; expand. The first version of this redesign would try to:. * Discard functions, instructions and metadata that don’t influence the; interesting-ness test; * Remove unused parameters from functions; * Eliminate unvisited conditional paths; * Rename variables to more regular ones (such as “a”, “b”, “c”, etc.). Once these passes are implemented, more meaningful reductions (such as type; reduction) would be added to the tool, to even further reduce IR. ## Background on historical bugpoint issues. ### Root Cause Analysis; Presently, bugpoint takes a long time to find the source problem in a given IR; file, mainly due to the fact that it tries to debug the input by running; various strategies to classify the bug, which in turn run multiple optimizer; and compilation passes over the input, taking up a lot of time. Furthermore,; when the IR crashes, it tries to reduce it by performing some sub-optimal; passes (e.g. a lot of unreachable blocks), and sometimes even fails to minimize; at all. ### ""Quirky"" Interface; Bugpoint’s current interface overwhelms and confuses the user, the help screen; alone ends up confusing rather providing guidance. And, not only are there; numerous features and options, but some of them also work in unexpected ways; and most of the time the user ends up using a custom script.

In subsequent analysis, the statistical nature of the errors must; be handled properly. As the last step, measurements are compared to models, and free model; parameters need to be determined in this process.

The simplest technique would be to define a; new ABI such that the intended call target is passed into the called function; and checked in the entry. Unfortunately, new ABIs are quite expensive to deploy; in C and C++.

Merely accumulating predicate state involves significant cost. There are; several key optimizations we employ to minimize this and various alternatives; that present different tradeoffs in the generated code. First, we work to reduce the number of instructions used to track the state:; * Rather than inserting a `cmovCC` instruction along every conditional edge in; the original program, we track each set of condition flags we need to capture; prior to entering each basic block and reuse a common `cmovCC` sequence for; those.; * We could further reuse suffixes when there are multiple `cmovCC`; instructions required to capture the set of flags. Currently this is; believed to not be worth the cost as paired flags are relatively rare and; suffixes of them are exceedingly rare.; * A common pattern in x86 is to have multiple conditional jump instructions; that use the same flags but handle different conditions. Naively, we could; consider each fallthrough between them an ""edge"" but this causes a much more; complex control flow graph. Instead, we accumulate the set of conditions; necessary for fallthrough and use a sequence of `cmovCC` instructions in a; single fallthrough edge to track it. Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state.

SmallString is a subclass of :ref:`SmallVector <dss_smallvector>` that adds some; convenience APIs like += that takes StringRef's. SmallString avoids allocating; memory in the case when the preallocated space is enough to hold its data, and; it calls back to general heap allocation when required. Since it owns its data,; it is very safe to use and supports full mutation of the string. Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow. As such, it is better to use; SmallVector or Twine as a scratch buffer, but then use std::string to persist; the result. ..",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:75771,allocate,allocated,75771,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible. The collection of all guarded slots makes up the *guarded; allocation pool*. Buffer Underflow/Overflow Detection; -----------------------------------. We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages.

Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will help identify the root cause of the bug. Allocations are randomly selected to be either left- or right-aligned to provide; equal detection of both underflows and overflows. Use after Free Detection; ------------------------. The guarded allocation pool also provides use-after-free detection. Whenever a; sampled allocation is deallocated, we map its guarded slot as inaccessible.

This method is called after the ``run*`` method for the; class, before the next call of ``run*`` in your pass. Registering dynamically loaded passes; =====================================. *Size matters* when constructing production quality tools using LLVM, both for; the purposes of distribution, and for regulating the resident code size when; running on the target system. Therefore, it becomes desirable to selectively; use some passes, while omitting others and maintain the flexibility to change; configurations later on. You want to be able to do all this, and, provide; feedback to the user. This is where pass registration comes into play. The fundamental mechanisms for pass registration are the; ``MachinePassRegistry`` class and subclasses of ``MachinePassRegistryNode``. An instance of ``MachinePassRegistry`` is used ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst:47644,allocate,allocated,47644,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']
Energy Efficiency,"mplex``) and vectors; (``__attribute((vector_size(16)))``) are treated as arrays. Bytecode Execution; ==================. Bytecode is executed using a stack-based interpreter. The execution; context consists of an ``InterpStack``, along with a chain of; ``InterpFrame`` objects storing the call frames. Frames are built by; call instructions and destroyed by return instructions. They perform; one allocation to reserve space for all locals in a single block.; These objects store all the required information to emit stack traces; whenever evaluation fails. Memory Organisation; ===================. Memory management in the interpreter relies on 3 data structures: ``Block``; objects which store the data and associated inline metadata, ``Pointer``; objects which refer to or into blocks, and ``Descriptor`` structures which; describe blocks and subobjects nested inside blocks. Blocks; ------. Blocks contain data interleaved with metadata. They are allocated either; statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter; values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame; containing the local variables of a function. Blocks are associated with a; descriptor that characterises the entire allocation, along with a few; additional attributes:. * ``IsStatic`` indicates whether the block has static duration in the; interpreter, i.e. it is not a local in a frame. * ``DeclID`` identifies each global declaration (it is set to an invalid; and irrelevant value for locals) in order to prevent illegal writes and; reads involving globals and temporaries with static storage duration. Static blocks are never deallocated, but local ones might be deallocated; even when there are live pointers to them. Pointers are only valid as; long as the blocks they point to are valid, so a block with pointers to; it whose lifetime ends is kept alive until all pointers to it go out of; scope. Since the frame is destroyed on function exit, such blocks are; turned into ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst:4346,allocate,allocated,4346,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

Observe first that there is a DBG_VALUE instruction for every ``llvm.dbg.value``; intrinsic in the source IR, ensuring no source level assignments go missing.; Then consider the different ways in which variable locations have been recorded:. * For the first dbg.value an immediate operand is used to record a zero value.; * The dbg.value of the PHI instruction leads to a DBG_VALUE of virtual register; ``%0``.; * The first GEP has its effect folded into the first load instruction; (as a 4-byte offset), but the variable location is salvaged by folding; the GEPs effect into the DIExpression.; * The second GEP is also folded into the corresponding load. However, it is; insufficiently simple to be salvaged, and is emitted as a ``$noreg``; DBG_VALUE, indicating that the variable takes on an undefined location.; * The final dbg.value has its Value placed in virtual register ``%1``. Instruction Scheduling; ----------------------. A number of passes can reschedule instructions, notably instruction selection; and the pre-and-post RA machine schedulers. Instruction scheduling can; significantly change the nature of the program -- in the (very unlikely) worst; case the instruction sequence could be completely reversed. In such; circumstances LLVM follows the principle applied to optimizations, that it is; better for the debugger not to display any state than a misleading state.; Thus, whenever instructions are advanced in order of execution, any; corresponding DBG_VALUE is kept in its original position, and if an instruction; is delayed then the variable is given an undefined location for the duration; of the delay. To illustrate, consider this pseudo-MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6.

A **`TClonesArray`** is an array of identical (clone) objects. The; memory for the objects stored in the array is allocated only once in the; lifetime of the clones array. All objects must be of the same class. For; the rest this class has the same properties as a **`TObjArray`**. ![The internal data structure of a TClonesArray](pictures/020001A8.jpg). The figure above shows the internal data structure of a; **`TClonesArray`**. The class is specially designed for repetitive data; analysis tasks, where in a loop many times the same objects, are created; and deleted. The only supported way to add objects to a; **`TClonesArray`** is via the `new` with placement method. The different; `Add()` methods of **`TObjArray`** and its base classes are not; supported. ### The Idea Behind TClonesArray. To reduce the very large number of new and delete calls in large loops; like this (O(100000) x O(10000) times new/delete):. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray a(10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); a[i] = new TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Delete();; }; ```. You better use a **`TClonesArray`** which reduces the number of; new/delete calls to only O(10000):. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray a(""TTrack"", 10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); TTrack *track = (Track*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Clear(); // Or Clear(""C"") if the track objects must be returned (via Track::Clear) to a default state.; }; ```. Considering that a pair of new/delete calls on average cost about 70 ms,; O(109) new/deletes will save about 19 hours.

Though you're probably reading this because you want to write or maintain a; compiler backend, LLVM also fully supports building a native assembler.; We've tried hard to automate the generation of the assembler from the .td files; (in particular the instruction syntax and encodings), which means that a large; part of the manual and repetitive data entry can be factored and shared with the; compiler. Instruction Parsing; -------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. Instruction Alias Processing; ----------------------------. Once the instruction is parsed, it enters the MatchInstructionImpl function.; The MatchInstructionImpl function performs alias processing and then does actual; matching. Alias processing is the phase that canonicalizes different lexical forms of the; same instructions down to one representation. There are several different kinds; of alias that are possible to implement and they are listed below in the order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fldcww"", ""fldcw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fucompi"", ""fucomip"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""ud2a"", ""ud2"">;. ... and many others.

We believe that Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) are a great way; to pull together various pieces of the development puzzle, and aim to make clang; work well in such an environment. The chief advantage of an IDE is that they; typically have visibility across your entire project and are long-lived; processes, whereas stand-alone compiler tools are typically invoked on each; individual file in the project, and thus have limited scope.; There are many implications of this difference, but a significant one has to; do with efficiency and caching: sharing an address space across different files; in a project, means that you can use intelligent caching and other techniques to; dramatically reduce analysis/compilation time.; A further difference between IDEs and batch compiler is that they often; impose very different requirements on the front-end: they depend on high; performance in order to provide a ""snappy"" experience, and thus really want; techniques like ""incremental compilation"", ""fuzzy parsing"", etc. Finally, IDEs; often have very different requirements than code generation, often requiring; information that a codegen-only frontend can throw away. Clang is; specifically designed and built to capture this information. Use the LLVM 'Apache 2' License.

Energy Efficiency,"namically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============. The compound statement of a Block is treated much like a function body; with respect to control flow in that goto, break, and continue do not; escape the Block. Exceptions are treated *normally* in that when; thrown they pop stack frames until a catch clause is found. Objective-C Extensions; ======================.

To aleviate the pain for Windows users who want to try ROOT 6 we provide; a recipe on how to run ROOT 6 in a VM on Windows. Building ROOT also requires a C++11 compatible compiler, so one needs to either have installed gcc >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.4. On most lecagy platforms these newer compilers are available via a special install.; See the [build prerequisites](https://root.cern/install/dependencies/) page. Despite that, an additional platform as been added: the [x32; psAPI](https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/), called linuxx32gcc. It is; a regular x86-64 ABI but with shorter pointers (4 bytes instead of 8).; This reduces the addressable memory per process to 4GB - but that is; usally sufficient. The advantages are reduced memory consumption (due to; the smaller pointers) and increased performance compared to 32 bit; applications due to the availability of the 64 bit instructions. The; Clang developers mailing list archive [contains a good; comparison](http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Re-PATCH-add-x32-psABI-support-td4024297.html). To build and run binaries compiled in x32, toolchain support is needed.; That is available in the in binutils (2.22), GCC (4.8), glibc (2.16),; Linux kernel (3.4) and even GDB (7.5).

This intrinsic returns an opaque pointer value that can be passed to; :ref:`llvm.stackrestore <int_stackrestore>`.

Energy Efficiency,"nd.; Today, only Aarch64 and X86_64 are supported. .. _OpenWork:. Limitations and Half Baked Ideas; ================================. Mixing References and Raw Pointers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Support for languages which allow unmanaged pointers to garbage collected; objects (i.e. pass a pointer to an object to a C routine) in the abstract; machine model. At the moment, the best idea on how to approach this; involves an intrinsic or opaque function which hides the connection between; the reference value and the raw pointer. The problem is that having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times.

Energy Efficiency,"nfo*) that are; handled in that range, and an associated action that should take place. Actions; typically pass control to a *landing pad*. A landing pad corresponds roughly to the code found in the ``catch`` portion of; a ``try``/``catch`` sequence. When execution resumes at a landing pad, it; receives an *exception structure* and a *selector value* corresponding to the; *type* of exception thrown. The selector is then used to determine which *catch*; should actually process the exception. LLVM Code Generation; ====================. From a C++ developer's perspective, exceptions are defined in terms of the; ``throw`` and ``try``/``catch`` statements. In this section we will describe the; implementation of LLVM exception handling in terms of C++ examples. Throw; -----. Languages that support exception handling typically provide a ``throw``; operation to initiate the exception process. Internally, a ``throw`` operation; breaks down into two steps. #. A request is made to allocate exception space for an exception structure.; This structure needs to survive beyond the current activation. This structure; will contain the type and value of the object being thrown. #. A call is made to the runtime to raise the exception, passing the exception; structure as an argument. In C++, the allocation of the exception structure is done by the; ``__cxa_allocate_exception`` runtime function. The exception raising is handled; by ``__cxa_throw``. The type of the exception is represented using a C++ RTTI; structure. Try/Catch; ---------. A call within the scope of a *try* statement can potentially raise an; exception. In those circumstances, the LLVM C++ front-end replaces the call with; an ``invoke`` instruction. Unlike a call, the ``invoke`` has two potential; continuation points:. #. where to continue when the call succeeds as per normal, and. #. where to continue if the call raises an exception, either by a throw or the; unwinding of a throw. The term used to define the place where ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:6244,allocate,allocate,6244,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocate']

The ``addEscapingUse`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``addEscapingUse`` method is used when the uses of a pointer value have; changed in ways that may invalidate precomputed analysis information.; Implementations may either use this callback to provide conservative responses; for points whose uses have change since analysis time, or may recompute some or; all of their internal state to continue providing accurate responses. In general, any new use of a pointer value is considered an escaping use, and; must be reported through this callback, *except* for the uses below:. * A ``bitcast`` or ``getelementptr`` of the pointer; * A ``store`` through the pointer (but not a ``store`` *of* the pointer); * A ``load`` through the pointer. Efficiency Issues; -----------------. From the LLVM perspective, the only thing you need to do to provide an efficient; alias analysis is to make sure that alias analysis **queries** are serviced; quickly. The actual calculation of the alias analysis results (the ""run""; method) is only performed once, but many (perhaps duplicate) queries may be; performed. Because of this, try to move as much computation to the run method; as possible (within reason). Limitations; -----------. The AliasAnalysis infrastructure has several limitations which make writing a; new ``AliasAnalysis`` implementation difficult. There is no way to override the default alias analysis. It would be very useful; to be able to do something like ""``opt -my-aa -O2``"" and have it use ``-my-aa``; for all passes which need AliasAnalysis, but there is currently no support for; that, short of changing the source code and recompiling. Similarly, there is; also no way of setting a chain of analyses as the default. There is no way for transform passes to declare that they preserve; ``AliasAnalysis`` implementations.

In the above example, a call to `fWebHistogram.GetObject()` executes the; script with the function `GetWebHistogram`. This script connects a file; with histograms: `pippa.root` on the ROOT Web site and returns the; object `h6` to **`TRef`**`::GetObject`. ``` {.cpp}; TRef fWebHistogram; //EXEC:GetWebHistogram(); ```. Note that if the definition of the `TRef fWebHistogram` had been changed; the compiled or interpreted function `GetWebHistogram()` would have been; called instead of the Cling script `GetWebHistogram.C.`. ### Array of TRef. When storing multiple **`TRef`**s, it is more efficient to use a; **`TRefArray`**. The efficiency is due to having a single pointer `fPID`; for all `TRefs` in the array. It has a dynamic compact table of; `fUniqueIDs`. We recommend that you use a **`TRefArray`** rather then a; collection of `TRefs`. Example:. - Suppose a `TObjArray *mytracks` containing a list of `Track`; objects. - Suppose a `TRefArray *pions` containing pointers to the pion tracks; in `mytracks`. This list is created with statements like:; `pions->Add(track);`. - Suppose a `TRefArray *muons` containing pointers to the muon tracks; in `mytracks`. The 3 arrays `mytracks`,` pions` and `muons` may be written separately. ## Schema Evolution. Schema evolution is a problem faced by long-lived data.

VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid.

Such checks can be disabled using environment variables. Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation. Even more includes will be ""hidden"" when ROOT configured with `-Ddev=ON` build option.; In that case ROOT uses `#ifdef R__LESS_INCLUDES` to replace unused includes by class forward declarations.; Such `dev` builds can be used to verify that ROOT-based code really includes all necessary ROOT headers. ## RDataFrame. - Starting from this version, when `RSnapshotOptions.fMode` is `""UPDATE""` (i.e. the output file is opened in ""UPDATE""; mode), Snapshot will refuse to write out a TTree if one with the same name is already present in the output file.; Users can set the new flag `RSnapshotOption::fOverwriteIfExists` to `true` to force the deletion of the TTree that is; already present and the writing of a new TTree with the same name.

However, it is; insufficiently simple to be salvaged, and is emitted as a ``$noreg``; DBG_VALUE, indicating that the variable takes on an undefined location.; * The final dbg.value has its Value placed in virtual register ``%1``. Instruction Scheduling; ----------------------. A number of passes can reschedule instructions, notably instruction selection; and the pre-and-post RA machine schedulers. Instruction scheduling can; significantly change the nature of the program -- in the (very unlikely) worst; case the instruction sequence could be completely reversed. In such; circumstances LLVM follows the principle applied to optimizations, that it is; better for the debugger not to display any state than a misleading state.; Thus, whenever instructions are advanced in order of execution, any; corresponding DBG_VALUE is kept in its original position, and if an instruction; is delayed then the variable is given an undefined location for the duration; of the delay. To illustrate, consider this pseudo-MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6.

This is; especially useful when dealing with data that comes in sets or arrays. - **addToGlobalScope()**: helps add code statements to the global scope; (e.g., to declare variables). - **addToCodeBody()**: adds the input string to the squashed code body. If a; class implements a translate function that wants to emit something to the; squashed code body, it must call this function with the code it wants to; emit. In case of loops, it automatically determines if the code needs to be; stored inside or outside the scope of that loop. - **makeValidVarName()**: takes a string (e.g., a variable name) and converts; it into a valid C++ variable name by replacing any forbidden characters with; underscores. - **buildArg()**: helps convert RooFit objects into arrays or other C++; representations for efficient computation. - **addResult()**: adds (or overwrites) the string representing the result of; a node. > For each `translate()` function, it is important to call `addResult()` since; this is what enables the squashing to happen. - **getResult()**: gets the result for the given node using the node name.; This node also performs the necessary code generation through recursive calls; to `translate()`. - **assembleCode()**: combines the generated code statements into the final; code body of the squashed function.

Sentinels; ^^^^^^^^^. ``ilist``\ s have another specialty that must be considered. To be a good; citizen in the C++ ecosystem, it needs to support the standard container; operations, such as ``begin`` and ``end`` iterators, etc. Also, the; ``operator--`` must work correctly on the ``end`` iterator in the case of; non-empty ``ilist``\ s. The only sensible solution to this problem is to allocate a so-called *sentinel*; along with the intrusive list, which serves as the ``end`` iterator, providing; the back-link to the last element. However conforming to the C++ convention it; is illegal to ``operator++`` beyond the sentinel and it also must not be; dereferenced. These constraints allow for some implementation freedom to the ``ilist`` how to; allocate and store the sentinel. The corresponding policy is dictated by; ``ilist_traits<T>``. By default a ``T`` gets heap-allocated whenever the need; for a sentinel arises. While the default policy is sufficient in most cases, it may break down when; ``T`` does not provide a default constructor. Also, in the case of many; instances of ``ilist``\ s, the memory overhead of the associated sentinels is; wasted. To alleviate the situation with numerous and voluminous; ``T``-sentinels, sometimes a trick is employed, leading to *ghostly sentinels*. Ghostly sentinels are obtained by specially-crafted ``ilist_traits<T>`` which; superpose the sentinel with the ``ilist`` instance in memory. Pointer; arithmetic is used to obtain the sentinel, which is relative to the ``ilist``'s; ``this`` pointer. The ``ilist`` is augmented by an extra pointer, which serves; as the back-link of the sentinel. This is the only field in the ghostly; sentinel which can be legally accessed.

The ``llvm::ArrayRef`` class is the preferred class to use in an interface that; accepts a sequential list of elements in memory and just reads from them. By; taking an ``ArrayRef``, the API can be passed a fixed size array, an; ``std::vector``, an ``llvm::SmallVector`` and anything else that is contiguous; in memory. .. _dss_fixedarrays:. Fixed Size Arrays; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Fixed size arrays are very simple and very fast. They are good if you know; exactly how many elements you have, or you have a (low) upper bound on how many; you have. .. _dss_heaparrays:. Heap Allocated Arrays; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Heap allocated arrays (``new[]`` + ``delete[]``) are also simple. They are good; if the number of elements is variable, if you know how many elements you will; need before the array is allocated, and if the array is usually large (if not,; consider a :ref:`SmallVector <dss_smallvector>`). The cost of a heap allocated; array is the cost of the new/delete (aka malloc/free). Also note that if you; are allocating an array of a type with a constructor, the constructor and; destructors will be run for every element in the array (re-sizable vectors only; construct those elements actually used). .. _dss_tinyptrvector:. llvm/ADT/TinyPtrVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``TinyPtrVector<Type>`` is a highly specialized collection class that is; optimized to avoid allocation in the case when a vector has zero or one; elements.

BasicBlock *BB = ...; for (auto I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I); ... use I ... The observant may quickly point out that these two loops may have different; semantics: if the container (a basic block in this case) is being mutated, then; ""``BB->end()``"" may change its value every time through the loop and the second; loop may not in fact be correct. If you actually do depend on this behavior,; please write the loop in the first form and add a comment indicating that you; did it intentionally. Why do we prefer the second form (when correct)? Writing the loop in the first; form has two problems. First it may be less efficient than evaluating it at the; start of the loop. In this case, the cost is probably minor --- a few extra; loads every time through the loop. However, if the base expression is more; complex, then the cost can rise quickly. I've seen loops where the end; expression was actually something like: ""``SomeMap[X]->end()``"" and map lookups; really aren't cheap. By writing it in the second form consistently, you; eliminate the issue entirely and don't even have to think about it. The second (even bigger) issue is that writing the loop in the first form hints; to the reader that the loop is mutating the container (a fact that a comment; would handily confirm!). If you write the loop in the second form, it is; immediately obvious without even looking at the body of the loop that the; container isn't being modified, which makes it easier to read the code and; understand what it does.

Energy Efficiency,"o do this can; only start such queries from itself. Using alias analysis results; ============================. There are several different ways to use alias analysis results. In order of; preference, these are:. Using the ``MemoryDependenceAnalysis`` Pass; -------------------------------------------. The ``memdep`` pass uses alias analysis to provide high-level dependence; information about memory-using instructions. This will tell you which store; feeds into a load, for example. It uses caching and other techniques to be; efficient, and is used by Dead Store Elimination, GVN, and memcpy optimizations. .. _AliasSetTracker:. Using the ``AliasSetTracker`` class; -----------------------------------. Many transformations need information about alias **sets** that are active in; some scope, rather than information about pairwise aliasing. The; `AliasSetTracker <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasSetTracker.html>`__; class is used to efficiently build these Alias Sets from the pairwise alias; analysis information provided by the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface. First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in. Once all of the alias sets are completed, your pass should; simply iterate through the constructed alias sets, using the ``AliasSetTracker``; ``begin()``/``end()`` methods. The ``AliasSet``\s formed by the ``AliasSetTracker`` are guaranteed to be; disjoint, calculate mod/ref information and volatility for the set, and keep; track of whether or not all of the pointers in the set are Must aliases. The; AliasSetTracker also makes sure that sets are properly folded due to call; instructions, and can provide a list of pointers in each set. As an example user of this, the `Loop Invariant Code Motion; <doxygen/structLICM.html>`_ pass uses ``AliasSetTracker``\s to calculate alias; sets for each loop nest.

The size of a PowerPC frame is usually fixed for the duration of a function's; invocation. Since the frame is fixed size, all references into the frame can be; accessed via fixed offsets from the stack pointer.

The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively.

Memory Management with JITLinkMemoryManager; -------------------------------------------. JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs. To satisfy these requirements ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` adopts the following; design: The memory manager itself has just two virtual methods for asynchronous; operations (each with convenience overloads for calling synchronously):. .. code-block:: c++. /// Called when allocation has been completed.; using OnAllocatedFunction =; unique_function<void(Expected<std::unique_ptr<InFlightAlloc>)>;. /// Called when deallocation has completed.; using OnDeallocatedFunction = unique_function<void(Erro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:26078,allocate,allocated,26078,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possible.; - Don't parse arguments more than once.; - Provide a few simple interfaces for efficiently searching arguments. Simple; ------. Finally, the driver was designed to be ""as simple as possible"", given; the other goals. Notably, trying to be completely compatible with the; gcc driver adds a significant amount of complexity.

This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in; ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the; information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's libGeom and other third-party; code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will; require parsing. ROOTMAP files reduce parsing for code which is not in the PCH.

Energy Efficiency,"objects that are all of the same type. The format of a TClonesArray object; is given in \ref tclonesarray. There are two great advantages in the use of TClonesArray over TObjArray when the objects; all will be of the same class:. 1. Memory for the objects will be allocated only once for the entire array, rather; than the per-object allocation for TObjArray. This can be done because all the; objects are the same size.; 2. In the case of TObjArray, the stored objects are written sequentially. However,; in a TClonesArray, by default, each object is split one level deep into its base; class(es) and data members, and each of these members is written sequentially for; all objects in the array before the next member is written. This has two advantages:; 1. Greater compression can be achieved when similar data is consecutive.; 2. The object's data members can easily be split into different TTree branches; (TTrees are discussed below). ### TTree. A TTree is a highly specialized container class for efficient storage and retrieval of user data.; The use of TTrees is discussed in detail in the; [Trees chapter of the Root Manual](https://root.cern/manual/trees/). Here we discuss in particular how a TTree is stored in a ROOTIO file. A TTree object is split into one or more branches (class TBranch), each of which may have its own; (sub)branches, recursively to any depth. Each TBranch contains an array of zero or more leaves; (class TLeaf), each corresponding to a basic variable type or a class object that has not been split.; The TLeaf object does not actually contain variable values, only information about the variables.; The actual data on each branch is physically stored in basket objects (class TBasket). The user; can set the basket size on a per TBranch basis. The default basket size is 32000 bytes.; This should be viewed as an approximate number. There is one TTree data record per file for each tree in the file, corresponding to a TTree; class object.

Where is the captured result stored?; ------------------------------------. ``LastValue`` holds the last result of the value printing. It is a class member; because it can be accessed even after subsequent inputs. **Note:** If no value printing happens, then it is in an invalid state. Improving Efficiency and User Experience; ----------------------------------------. The Value object is essentially used to create a mapping between an expression; 'type' and the allocated 'memory'. Built-in types (bool, char, int,; float, double, etc.) are copyable. Their memory allocation size is known; and the Value object can introduce a small-buffer optimization.; In case of objects, the ``Value`` class provides reference-counted memory; management. The implementation maps the type as written and the Clang Type to be able to use; the preprocessor to synthesize the relevant cast operations. For example,; ``X(char, Char_S)``, where ``char`` is the type from the language's type system; and ``Char_S`` is the Clang builtin type which represents it. This mapping helps; to import execution results from the interpreter in a compiled program and vice; versa. The ``Value.h`` header file can be included at runtime and this is why it; has a very low token count and was developed with strict constraints in mind. This also enables the user to receive the computed 'type' back in their code; and then transform the type into something ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst:8873,allocate,allocated,8873,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones.

With the `TMatrixDEigen` and `TMatrixDSymEigen` classes, you can compute eigenvalues and; eigenvectors for general dense and symmetric real matrices. ## Additional Notes. The present package provides all facilities to completely AVOID; returning matrices. Use ""TMatrixD A(TMatrixD::kTransposed,B);""; and other fancy constructors as much as possible. If one really needs; to return a matrix, return a TMatrixTLazy object instead. The; conversion is completely transparent to the end user, e.g.; ""TMatrixT m = THaarMatrixT(5);"" and _is_ efficient. Since TMatrixT et al. are fully integrated in %ROOT, they of course; can be stored in a %ROOT database. ### How to efficiently use this package. #### 1. Never return complex objects (matrices or vectors); Danger: For example, when the following snippet:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD foo(int n); {; TMatrixD foom(n,n); fill_in(foom); return foom;; }; TMatrixD m = foo(5);; ~~~. runs, it constructs matrix foo:foom, copies it onto stack as a; return value and destroys foo:foom. Return value (a matrix); from foo() is then copied over to m (via a copy constructor),; and the return value is destroyed. So, the matrix constructor is; called 3 times and the destructor 2 times. For big matrices,; the cost of multiple constructing/copying/destroying of objects; may be very large. *Some* optimized compilers can cut down on 1; copying/destroying, but still it leaves at least two calls to; the constructor.

Data-sharing modes; ------------------. Clang supports two data-sharing models for Cuda devices: `Generic` and `Cuda`; modes. The default mode is `Generic`. `Cuda` mode can give an additional; performance and can be activated using the `-fopenmp-cuda-mode` flag. In; `Generic` mode all local variables that can be shared in the parallel regions; are stored in the global memory. In `Cuda` mode local variables are not shared; between the threads and it is user responsibility to share the required data; between the threads in the parallel regions. Often, the optimizer is able to; reduce the cost of `Generic` mode to the level of `Cuda` mode, but the flag,; as well as other assumption flags, can be used for tuning. Features not supported or with limited support for Cuda devices; ---------------------------------------------------------------. - Cancellation constructs are not supported. - Doacross loop nest is not supported. - User-defined reductions are supported only for trivial types. - Nested parallelism: inner parallel regions are executed sequentially. - Debug information for OpenMP target regions is supported, but sometimes it may; be required to manually specify the address class of the inspected variables.; In some cases the local variables are actually allocated in the global memory,; but the debug info may be not aware of it. .. _OpenMP implementation details:.

The ``-O1`` is important because ``-O0`` adds the ``optnone``; function attribute to all functions and many passes don't run on ``optnone``; functions. Then run:. .. code-block:: bash. opt -O3 foo.bc -disable-output. If this doesn't crash, please follow the instructions for a :ref:`front-end; bug <frontend-crash>`.

ThreadSafeModule is a wrapper that ensures that; Modules that use the same LLVMContext are not accessed concurrently.; See `How to use ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext`_. 5. Symbol lookup is no longer handled by layers. Instead, there is a; ``lookup`` method on JITDylib that takes a list of JITDylibs to scan. .. code-block:: c++.

Symbol strings in ORC are uniqued to improve lookup performance, reduce memory; overhead, and allow symbol names to function as efficient keys.

If you wish to perform lookup using the C/IR name of a symbol you will also; need to apply the platform linker-mangling before interning the string. On; Linux this mangling is a no-op, but on other platforms it usually involves; adding a prefix to the string (e.g. '_' on Darwin). The mangling scheme is; based on the DataLayout for the target. Given a DataLayout and an; ExecutionSession, you can create a MangleAndInterner function object that; will perform both jobs for you:. .. code-block:: c++.

As such,; SmallVectors are most useful when on the stack. In the absence of a well-motivated choice for the number of; inlined elements ``N``, it is recommended to use ``SmallVector<T>`` (that is,; omitting the ``N``).

Energy Efficiency,"owed. What effect do address spaces have on GEPs?; -------------------------------------------. None, except that the address space qualifier on the second operand pointer type; always matches the address space qualifier on the result type. How is GEP different from ``ptrtoint``, arithmetic, and ``inttoptr``?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. It's very similar; there are only subtle differences. With ptrtoint, you have to pick an integer type. One approach is to pick i64;; this is safe on everything LLVM supports (LLVM internally assumes pointers are; never wider than 64 bits in many places), and the optimizer will actually narrow; the i64 arithmetic down to the actual pointer size on targets which don't; support 64-bit arithmetic in most cases. However, there are some cases where it; doesn't do this. With GEP you can avoid this problem. Also, GEP carries additional pointer aliasing rules. It's invalid to take a GEP; from one object, address into a different separately allocated object, and; dereference it. IR producers (front-ends) must follow this rule, and consumers; (optimizers, specifically alias analysis) benefit from being able to rely on; it. See the `Rules`_ section for more information. And, GEP is more concise in common cases. However, for the underlying integer computation implied, there is no; difference. I'm writing a backend for a target which needs custom lowering for GEP. How do I do this?; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. You don't. The integer computation implied by a GEP is target-independent.; Typically what you'll need to do is make your backend pattern-match expressions; trees involving ADD, MUL, etc., which are what GEP is lowered into. This has the; advantage of letting your code work correctly in more cases. GEP does use target-dependent parameters for the size and layout of data types,; which targets can customize.

The ``DeclarationName`` class represents the name of a declaration in Clang.; Declarations in the C family of languages can take several different forms.; Most declarations are named by simple identifiers, e.g., ""``f``"" and ""``x``"" in; the function declaration ``f(int x)``. In C++, declaration names can also name; class constructors (""``Class``"" in ``struct Class { Class(); }``), class; destructors (""``~Class``""), overloaded operator names (""``operator+``""), and; conversion functions (""``operator void const *``""). In Objective-C,; declaration names can refer to the names of Objective-C methods, which involve; the method name and the parameters, collectively called a *selector*, e.g.,; ""``setWidth:height:``"". Since all of these kinds of entities --- variables,; functions, Objective-C methods, C++ constructors, destructors, and operators; --- are represented as subclasses of Clang's common ``NamedDecl`` class,; ``DeclarationName`` is designed to efficiently represent any kind of name. Given a ``DeclarationName`` ``N``, ``N.getNameKind()`` will produce a value; that describes what kind of name ``N`` stores. There are 10 options (all of; the names are inside the ``DeclarationName`` class). ``Identifier``. The name is a simple identifier. Use ``N.getAsIdentifierInfo()`` to retrieve; the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo*`` pointing to the actual identifier. ``ObjCZeroArgSelector``, ``ObjCOneArgSelector``, ``ObjCMultiArgSelector``. The name is an Objective-C selector, which can be retrieved as a ``Selector``; instance via ``N.getObjCSelector()``. The three possible name kinds for; Objective-C reflect an optimization within the ``DeclarationName`` class:; both zero- and one-argument selectors are stored as a masked; ``IdentifierInfo`` pointer, and therefore require very little space, since; zero- and one-argument selectors are far more",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:69115,efficient,efficiently,69115,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

Eliminating Bit Vector Checks for All-Ones Bit Vectors; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If the bit vector is all ones, the bit vector check is redundant; we simply; need to check that the address is in range and well aligned. This is more; likely to occur if the virtual tables are padded. Forward-Edge CFI for Virtual Calls by Interleaving Virtual Tables; -----------------------------------------------------------------. Dimitar et. al. proposed a novel approach that interleaves virtual tables in [1]_.; This approach is more efficient in terms of space because padding and bit vectors are no longer needed.; At the same time, it is also more efficient in terms of performance because in the interleaved layout; address points of the virtual tables are consecutive, thus the validity check of a virtual; vtable pointer is always a range check. At a high level, the interleaving scheme consists of three steps: 1) split virtual table groups into; separate virtual tables, 2) order virtual tables by a pre-order traversal of the class hierarchy; and 3) interleave virtual tables. The interleaving scheme implemented in LLVM is inspired by [1]_ but has its own; enhancements (more in `Interleave virtual tables`_). ..

While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them. Instruction naming; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An instruction name consists of the base name, a default operand size, and a; character per operand with an optional special size. For example:. ::. ADD8rr -> add, 8-bit register, 8-bit register; IMUL16rmi -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 16-bit immediate; IMUL16rmi8 -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 8-bit immediate; MOVSX32rm16 -> movsx, 32-bit register, 16-bit memory.

It; bypasses Dispatch, Scheduler and Load/Store unit. Instructions are issued as; soon as their operand registers are available and resource requirements are; met. Multiple instructions can be issued in one cycle according to the value of; the ``IssueWidth`` parameter in LLVM's scheduling model. Once issued, an instruction is moved to ``IssuedInst`` set until it is ready to; retire. :program:`llvm-mca` ensures that writes are committed in-order.

The; CustomBehaviour class can be used in these cases to enforce proper; instruction modeling (often by customizing data dependencies and detecting; hazards that :program:`llvm-mca` has no way of knowing about). :program:`llvm-mca` comes with one generic and multiple target specific; CustomBehaviour classes. The generic class will be used if the ``-disable-cb``; flag is used or if a target specific CustomBehaviour class doesn't exist for; that target. (The generic class does nothing.)

Dimitar et. al. proposed a novel approach that interleaves virtual tables in [1]_.; This approach is more efficient in terms of space because padding and bit vectors are no longer needed.; At the same time, it is also more efficient in terms of performance because in the interleaved layout; address points of the virtual tables are consecutive, thus the validity check of a virtual; vtable pointer is always a range check. At a high level, the interleaving scheme consists of three steps: 1) split virtual table groups into; separate virtual tables, 2) order virtual tables by a pre-order traversal of the class hierarchy; and 3) interleave virtual tables. The interleaving scheme implemented in LLVM is inspired by [1]_ but has its own; enhancements (more in `Interleave virtual tables`_). ..

Sometimes, the object is simply trying to; prevent itself from being destroyed, but ``dealloc`` is really far too late; for the object to be raising such objections. Somewhat more legitimately, an; object may have been pool-allocated and should not be deallocated with; ``free``; for now, this can only be supported with a ``dealloc``; implementation outside of ARC. Such an implementation must be very careful; to do all the other work that ``NSObject``'s ``dealloc`` would, which is; outside the scope of this document to describe.

Overhead; --------. The main overhead of JITing Numba traces is in the type annotation in Numba; itself, optimization of the IR and assembly by the backend less so.; (There is also a non-negligible cost to Numba initialization, which is why; ``cppyy`` does not provide automatic extension hooks.); The use of ``cppyy`` bound C++, which relies on the same Numba machinery,; does not change that, since the reflection-based lookups are in C++ and; comparatively very fast.; For example, there is no appreciable difference in wall clock time to JIT a; trace using Numba's included math functions (from module ``math`` or; ``numpy``) or one that uses C++ bound ones whether from the standard library; or a templated versions from e.g. Eigen.; Use of very complex template expressions may change this balance, but in; principle, w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:9052,energy,energy,9052,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['energy'],['energy']

However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions. Fast, single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shrxq %rax, %rsi, %rsi # Shift away bits if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations. This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple by around 30% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.; - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.; - Move RStringView.h to ROOT/RStringView.hxx and always include ROOT/RStringView.hxx instead of RStringView.h for backward compatibility; - In `TClingCallFunc`, support r-value reference parameters. This paves the way for the corresponding support in PyROOT (implemented now in the latest Cppyy).; - Included the new TSequentialExecutor in ROOT, sharing the interfaces of TExecutor.This should improve code economy when providing a fallback for TThreadExecutor/TProcessExecutor. ### Thread safety; - Resolved several race conditions, dead-locks, performance and order of initialization/destruction issues still lingering because of or despite the new read-write lock mechanism. ## Interpreter. - Enabled use of multi-threaded code from the interpreter.; - Previouslyl multi-threaded code could be run from the interpreter as long as ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md:1815,reduce,reduces,1815,README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,1,['reduce'],['reduces']

The LLVM target-independent code generator consists of six main; components:. 1. `Abstract target description`_ interfaces which capture important properties; about various aspects of the machine, independently of how they will be used.; These interfaces are defined in ``include/llvm/Target/``. 2. Classes used to represent the `code being generated`_ for a target. These; classes are intended to be abstract enough to represent the machine code for; *any* target machine. These classes are defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/``. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" are explicitly exposed. 3. Classes and algorithms used to represent code at the object file level, the; `MC Layer`_. These classes represent assembly level constructs like labels,; sections, and instructions. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" don't exist. 4. `Target-independent algorithms`_ used to implement various phases of native; code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack frame representation,; etc). This code lives in ``lib/CodeGen/``. 5. `Implementations of the abstract target description interfaces`_ for; particular targets.

The difference between SetVector and other sets is that the order of iteration; is guaranteed to match the order of insertion into the SetVector. This property; is really important for things like sets of pointers. Because pointer values; are non-deterministic (e.g. vary across runs of the program on different; machines), iterating over the pointers in the set will not be in a well-defined; order. The drawback of SetVector is that it requires twice as much space as a normal; set and has the sum of constant factors from the set-like container and the; sequential container that it uses. Use it **only** if you need to iterate over; the elements in a deterministic order. SetVector is also expensive to delete; elements out of (linear time), unless you use its ""pop_back"" method, which is; faster. ``SetVector`` is an adapter class that defaults to using ``std::vector`` and a; size 16 ``SmallSet`` for the underlying containers, so it is quite expensive.; However, ``""llvm/ADT/SetVector.h""`` also provides a ``SmallSetVector`` class,; which defaults to using a ``SmallVector`` and ``SmallSet`` of a specified size.; If you use this, and if your sets are dynamically smaller than ``N``, you will; save a lot of heap traffic. .. _dss_uniquevector:. llvm/ADT/UniqueVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. UniqueVector is similar to :ref:`SetVector <dss_setvector>` but it retains a; unique ID for each element inserted into the set.

X86 address spaces supported; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. x86 has a feature which provides the ability to perform loads and stores to; different address spaces via the x86 segment registers. A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:92673,allocate,allocated,92673,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

The `PassManager <https://llvm.org/doxygen/PassManager_8h_source.html>`_ `class; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PassManager.html>`_ takes a list of; passes, ensures their :ref:`prerequisites <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>`; are set up correctly, and then schedules passes to run efficiently. All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together. This means that, given a series; of consecutive :ref:`FunctionPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>`, it; will execute all of the :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the first function, then all of the; :ref:`FunctionPasses <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the second; function, etc... until the entire program has been run through the passes. This improves the cache behavior of the compiler, because it is only; touching the LLVM program representation for a single function at a time,; instead of traversing the entire program. It reduces the memory consumption; of compiler, because, for example, only one `DominatorSet; <https://llvm.org/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst:41646,allocate,allocated,41646,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

This predicates (masks) all instructions in the loop, which allows the scalar; remainder loop (the tail) to be folded into the main vectorized loop. This; might be more efficient when vector predication is efficiently supported by the; target platform. Loop Unrolling; --------------. Unrolling a loop reduces the loop control overhead and exposes more; opportunities for ILP. Loops can be fully or partially unrolled. Full unrolling; eliminates the loop and replaces it with an enumerated sequence of loop; iterations. Full unrolling is only possible if the loop trip count is known at; compile time. Partial unrolling replicates the loop body within the loop and; reduces the trip count. If ``unroll(enable)`` is specified the unroller will attempt to fully unroll the; loop if the trip count is known at compile time.

Although it would be technically possible to use; sampling profiles for code coverage, sample-based profiles are too; coarse-grained for code coverage purposes; it would yield poor results. 4. Sampling profiles must be generated by an external tool. The profile; generated by that tool must then be converted into a format that can be read; by LLVM. The section on sampling profilers describes one of the supported; sampling profile formats. Using Sampling Profilers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sampling profilers are used to collect runtime information, such as; hardware counters, while your application executes. They are typically; very efficient and do not incur a large runtime overhead. The; sample data collected by the profiler can be used during compilation; to determine what the most executed areas of the code are. Using the data from a sample profiler requires some changes in the way; a program is built. Before the compiler can use profiling information,; the code needs to execute under the profiler. The following is the; usual build cycle when using sample profilers for optimization:. 1. Build the code with source line table information. You can use all the; usual build flags that you always build your application with. The only; requirement is that you add ``-gline-tables-only`` or ``-g`` to the; command line. This is important for the profiler to be able to map; instructions back to source line locations. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -gline-tables-only code.cc -o code. 2.

The; ``hashes`` array contains all of the 32 bit hash values for all names in the; hash table.

However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```.

Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value.

See the; section `Design Overview`_ for more details. Unless multiple JITDylibs are needed to model linkage relationships, ORCv1; clients should place all code in a single JITDylib.; MCJIT clients should use LLJIT (see `LLJIT and LLLazyJIT`_), and can place; code in LLJIT's default created main JITDylib (See; ``LLJIT::getMainJITDylib()``). 2.

Energy Efficiency,"ram. ![The tree viewer](pictures/030000FE.png). ### Reading the Tree. The `tree1r` function shows how to read the tree and access each entry; and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values. ``` {.cpp}; Float_t px, py, pz;; ```. Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry.; We do this with the method `TTree::SetBranchAddress`. The first; parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the; variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the; branch name is `px`. This name was given when the tree was written (see; `tree1w`). The second parameter is the address of the variable `px`. ``` {.cpp}; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; ```. #### GetEntry. Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be; read into the variables with the method `TTree::GetEntry(n)`. It; reads all the branches for entry (n) and populates the given address; accordingly. By default, `GetEntry()` reuses the space allocated by the; previous object for each branch. You can force the previous object to be; automatically deleted if you call `mybranch.SetAutoDelete(kTRUE)`; (default is `kFALSE`). Consider the example in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.h`. The top-level branch in; the tree `T` is declared with:. ``` {.cpp}; Event *event = 0;; // event must be null or point to a valid object;; // it must be initialized; T.SetBranchAddress(""event"",&event);; ```. When reading the Tree, one can choose one of these 3 options:. Option 1:. ``` {.cpp}; for (Int_t i = 0; i<nentries; i++) {; T.GetEntry(i);; //the object event has been filled at this point; }; ```. This is the default and recommended way to create an object of the class; `Event. `It will be pointed by `event`. At the following entries, `event` will be overwritten by the new data.; All internal members that are **`TObject`**\* are automatically deleted.; It is important that these members be in a valid state when `GetEntry`; is called.

The most important; thing when choosing a container is the algorithmic properties of how you plan to; access the container. Based on that, you should use:. * a :ref:`map-like <ds_map>` container if you need efficient look-up of a; value based on another value.

The array operand has no; extra data, but expects another operand to follow it, indicating the element; type of the array. When reading an array in an abbreviated record, the first; integer is a vbr6 that indicates the array length, followed by the encoded; elements of the array. An array may only occur as the last operand of an; abbreviation (except for the one final operand that gives the array's; type). * Char6 (code 4): This field should be emitted as a `char6-encoded value`_.; This operand type takes no extra data. Char6 encoding is normally used as an; array element type. * Blob (code 5): This field is emitted as a vbr6, followed by padding to a; 32-bit boundary (for alignment) and an array of 8-bit objects. The array of; bytes is further followed by tail padding to ensure that its total length is a; multiple of 4 bytes.

Implementation Details; ======================. .. _allocating stacklets:. Allocating Stacklets; --------------------. As mentioned above, the function prologue checks if the current stacklet has; enough space. The current approach is to use a slot in the TCB to store the; current stack limit (minus the amount of space needed to allocate a new block) -; this slot's offset is again dictated by ``libgcc``.

The size of function arguments on the stack needs to be passed to; ``__morestack`` (this function is implemented in ``libgcc``) since that number; of bytes has to be copied from the previous stacklet to the current one. This is; so that SP (and FP) relative addressing of function arguments work as expected. The unusual ``ret`` is needed to have the function which made a call to; ``__morestack`` return correctly. ``__morestack``, instead of returning, calls; into ``.LBB0_2``. This is possible since both, the size of the ``ret``; instruction and the PC of call to ``__morestack`` are known. When the function; body returns, control is transferred back to ``__morestack``. ``__morestack``; then de-allocates the new stacklet, restores the correct SP value, and does a; second return, which returns control to the correct caller.

Introduce a way to create branch using directly; an object:; MyClass object;; TBranch *branch = tree->Branch(branchname, &object, bufsize, splitlevel); Clarify the ownership rules of user objects in a TTree. This clarification (and the improved auto-add-to-directory behavior; of the TH1*) allows for the TTree to now delete the memory that; its has allocated and whose ownsership was _not_ transfer back; to the user (this is happens any time the user give the TTree; the address of a pointer):. For a top-level branch the meaning of addr is as follows:. If addr is zero, then we allocate a branch object; internally and the branch is the owner of the allocated; object, not the caller. However the caller may obtain; a pointer to the branch object with GetObject(). Example:. branch->SetAddress(0);; Event* event = branch->GetObject();; ... Do some work. If addr is not zero, but the pointer addr points at is; zero, then we allocate a branch object and set the passed; pointer to point at the allocated object. The caller; owns the allocated object and is responsible for deleting; it when it is no longer needed. Example:. Event* event = 0;; branch->SetAddress(&event);; ... Do some work.; delete event;; event = 0;. If addr is not zero and the pointer addr points at is; also not zero, then the caller has allocated a branch; object and is asking us to use it. The caller owns it; and must delete it when it is no longer needed. Example:. Event* event = new Event();; branch->SetAddress(&event);; ... Do some work.; delete event;; event = 0;. These rules affect users of TTree::Branch(),; TTree::SetBranchAddress(), and TChain::SetBranchAddress(); as well because those routines call this one.

Everything drawn in a ROOT canvas is an object. There are classes for; all objects, and they fall into hierarchies. In addition, the ROOT has; fully cross-platform GUI classes and provides all standard components; for an application environment with common ‘look and feel'. The; object-oriented, event-driven programming model supports the modern; signals/slots communication mechanism. It handles user interface actions; and allows total independence of interacting objects and classes. This; mechanism uses the ROOT dictionary information and the Cling the C++; Interpreter to connect signals to slots methods. Therefore, all necessary elements for an object-oriented editor design; are in place. The editor complexity can be reduced by splitting it into; discrete units of so-called *`object`* *`editors`*. Any object editor; provides an object specific GUI. The main purpose of the ROOT graphics; editor is the organization of the object editors' appearance and the; task sequence between them. ### Object Editors. Every object editor follows a simple naming convention: to have as a; name the object class name concatenated with ‘*`Editor`*' (e.g. for; **`TGraph`** objects the object editor is **`TGraphEditor`**). Thanks to; the signals/slots communication mechanism and to the method; `DistancetoPrimitive()` that computes a ‘‘distance'' to an object from; the mouse position, it was possible to implement a signal method of the; canvas that says which is the selected object and to which pad it; belongs. Having this information the graphics editor loads the; corresponding object editor and the user interface is ready for use.; This way after a click on ‘axis'—the axis editor is active; a click on a; ‘pad' activates the pad editor, etc. The ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md:101891,reduce,reduced,101891,documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue.

Energy Efficiency,"rocess.; In most UNIX systems, thread and process characteristics are grouped; into a single entity called a process. Sometimes, threads are called; ""lightweight processes''. Note: This introduction is adapted from the AIX 4.3 Programmer's Manual. ## Threads and Processes. In traditional single-threaded process systems, a process has a set of; properties. In multi-threaded systems, these properties are divided; between processes and threads. ### Process Properties. A process in a multi-threaded system is the changeable entity. It must; be considered as an execution frame. It has all traditional process; attributes, such as:. - Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID. - Environment. - Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler).

C++ Extensions; ==============. Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in automatic storage. As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression. Captured variables in Blocks on the heap are destroyed; when the reference count of the Block drops to zero. Variables declared as residing in ``__block`` storage may be initially; allocated in the heap or may first appear on the stack and be copied; to the heap as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. When copied; from the stack, ``__block`` variables are copied using their normal; qualification (i.e. without adding const). In C++11, ``__block``; variables are copied as x-values if that is possible, then as l-values; if not; if both fail, it's an error.

The runtime; identifies frames with appropriate exception handling actions, and successively; resets the register context of the current thread to the most recently active; frame with actions to run. In LLVM, execution resumes at a ``landingpad``; instruction, which produces register values provided by the runtime. If a; function is only cleaning up allocated resources, the function is responsible; for calling ``_Unwind_Resume`` to transition to the next most recently active; frame after it is finished cleaning up. Eventually, the frame responsible for; handling the exception calls ``__cxa_end_catch`` to destroy the exception,; release its memory, and resume normal control flow. The Windows EH model does not use these successive register context resets.; Instead, the active exception is typically described by a frame on the stack.; In the case of C++ exceptions, the exception object is allocated in stack memory; and its address is passed to ``__CxxThrowException``. General purpose structured; exceptions (SEH) are more analogous to Linux signals, and they are dispatched by; userspace DLLs provided with Windows.

Because of this, if the SmallVector is; dynamically smaller than N, no malloc is performed. This can be a big win in; cases where the malloc/free call is far more expensive than the code that; fiddles around with the elements. This is good for vectors that are ""usually small"" (e.g. the number of; predecessors/successors of a block is usually less than 8). On the other hand,; this makes the size of the SmallVector itself large, so you don't want to; allocate lots of them (doing so will waste a lot of space). As such,; SmallVectors are most useful when on the stack. In the absence of a well-motivated choice for the number of; inlined elements ``N``, it is recommended to use ``SmallVector<T>`` (that is,; omitting the ``N``). This will choose a default number of; inlined elements reasonable for allocation on the stack (for example, trying; to keep ``sizeof(SmallVector<T>)`` around 64 bytes). SmallVector also provides a nice portable and efficient replacement for; ``alloca``. SmallVector has grown a few other minor advantages over std::vector, causing; ``SmallVector<Type, 0>`` to be preferred over ``std::vector<Type>``. #. std::vector is exception-safe, and some implementations have pessimizations; that copy elements when SmallVector would move them. #.

Energy Efficiency,"s doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking.

Rules for updating debug locations; ==================================. .. _WhenToPreserveLocation:. When to preserve an instruction location; ----------------------------------------. A transformation should preserve the debug location of an instruction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instruction should be the same; as the location of the ``add`` instruction. * Tail duplication. For example, if blocks ``B1`` and ``B2`` both; unconditionally branch to ``B3`` and ``B3`` can be folded into its; predecessors, source locations from ``B3`` should be preserved. Examples of transformations for which this rule *does not* apply include:. * LICM.

For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3.

Furthermore, there was actually a constructor that took a `RooAbsArg x`, but it; was simply ignored. To fix all these problems, the existing constructors were replaced by a new one; that takes the observable explicitly. Since the old constructors resulted in wrong computation graphs that caused; trouble with the new CPU evaluation backend, they had to be removed without; deprecation. Please adapt your code if necessary. ### Renaming of some RooFit classes. The `RooPower` was renamed to `RooPowerSum`, and `RooExpPoly` was renamed to `RooLegacyExpPoly`. This was a necessary change, because the names of these classes introduced in ROOT 6.28 collided with some classes in CMS combine, which were around already long before. Therefore, the classes had to be renamed to not cause any problems for CMS. In the unlikeliy case where you should have used these new classes for analysis already, please adapt your code to the new names and re-create your workspaces. ## RDataFrame. * The `RDataFrame` constructors that take in input one or more file names (or globs thereof) will now infer the format of the dataset, either `TTree` or `RNTuple`, that is stored in the first input file. When multiple files are specified, it is assumed that all other files contain a coherent dataset of the same format and with the same schema, exactly as it used to happen with `TChain`. This automatic inference further contributes towards a zero-code-change experience when moving from processing a `TTree` to processing an `RNTuple` dataset while using an `RDataFrame`. It also introduces a backwards-incompatible behaviour, i.e. now the constructor needs to open one file in order to infer the dataset type. This means that if the file does not exist, the constructor will throw an exception. Previously, an exception would be thrown only at a JIT-ting time, before the start of the computations.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:14375,adapt,adapt,14375,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['adapt'],['adapt']
Energy Efficiency,"s not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be required; for radically different targets that do not fit into the LLVM machine; description model: FPGAs for example. .. _high-level design of the code generator:. The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------. The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and; quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors. Code; generation in this model is divided into the following stages:. 1. `Instruction Selection`_ --- This phase determines an efficient way to; express the input LLVM code in the target instruction set. This stage; produces the initial code for the program in the target instruction set, then; makes use of virtual registers in SSA form and physical registers that; represent any required register assignments due to target constraints or; calling conventions. This step turns the LLVM code into a DAG of target; instructions. 2. `Scheduling and Formation`_ --- This phase takes the DAG of target; instructions produced by the instruction selection phase, determines an; ordering of the instructions, then emits the instructions as :raw-html:`<tt>`; `MachineInstr`_\s :raw-html:`</tt>` with that ordering. Note that we; describe this in the `instruction selection section`_ because it operates on; a `SelectionDAG`_. 3. `SS",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:5014,efficient,efficient,5014,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient']
Energy Efficiency,"s on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:17444,efficient,efficient,17444,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

If `branchDescriptor` is set to an empty string (the default), it is; assumed that the **`Tree`** descriptor is given in the first line of the; file with a syntax like: `A/D:Table[2]/F:Ntracks/I:astring/C`. Otherwise branchDescriptor must be specified with the above syntax.Lines; in the input file starting with ""\#"" are ignored. A **`TBranch`** object; is created for each variable in the expression. The total number of rows; read from the file is returned. ## Trees in Analysis. The methods `TTree::Draw`, `TTree::MakeClass` and; `TTree::MakeSelector` are available for data analysis using trees. The; **`TTree::Draw`** method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the; trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one; line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look; at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your; analysis. For these cases, you can use `TTree::MakeClass`. It creates a; class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand; it to do the logic of your analysis. The `TTree::MakeSelector` is the recommended method for ROOT data; analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel; processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several; processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.; With `MakeClass` the user has control over the event loop, with; `MakeSelector `the tree is in control of the event loop. ## Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw.

Energy Efficiency,"s the algorithmic properties of how you plan to; access the container. Based on that, you should use:. * a :ref:`map-like <ds_map>` container if you need efficient look-up of a; value based on another value. Map-like containers also support efficient; queries for containment (whether a key is in the map). Map-like containers; generally do not support efficient reverse mapping (values to keys). If you; need that, use two maps. Some map-like containers also support efficient; iteration through the keys in sorted order. Map-like containers are the most; expensive sort, only use them if you need one of these capabilities. * a :ref:`set-like <ds_set>` container if you need to put a bunch of stuff into; a container that automatically eliminates duplicates. Some set-like; containers support efficient iteration through the elements in sorted order.; Set-like containers are more expensive than sequential containers. * a :ref:`sequential <ds_sequential>` container provides the most efficient way; to add elements and keeps track of the order they are added to the collection.; They permit duplicates and support efficient iteration, but do not support; efficient look-up based on a key. * a :ref:`string <ds_string>` container is a specialized sequential container or; reference structure that is used for character or byte arrays. * a :ref:`bit <ds_bit>` container provides an efficient way to store and; perform set operations on sets of numeric id's, while automatically; eliminating duplicates. Bit containers require a maximum of 1 bit for each; identifier you want to store. Once the proper category of container is determined, you can fine tune the; memory use, constant factors, and cache behaviors of access by intelligently; picking a member of the category.

Energy Efficiency,"s the compiler to pretend there is a file at a; specific location. This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms.

Geometrical modeling is a difficult task when the number of different; geometrical objects is 106-108.

This is the; reason why models like GEANT [1] introduced an additional dimension; (depth) in order to reduce the complexity of the problem. This concept; is also preserved by the ROOT modeller and introduces a pure geometrical; constraint between objects (volumes in our case) - containment. This; means in fact that any positioned volume has to be contained by another.; Now what means contained and positioned?. - We will say that a volume `contains` a point if this is inside the; shape associated to the volume. For instance, a volume having a box; shape will contain all points `P=(X,Y,Z)` verifying the conditions:; `Abs(Pi)dXi`. The points on the shape boundaries are considered as; inside the volume. The volume contains a daughter if it contains all; the points contained by the daughter.; - The definition of containment works of course only with points; defined in the local coordinate system of the considered volume.; `Positioning` a volume inside another have to introduce a; geometrical transformation between the two.

If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; ```. Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a; parameter, the syntax is:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; ```. You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared; library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled; speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". ```; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ```. ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available; ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By; typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call; functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; ```.

In; particular, GEP is a cornerstone of LLVM's `pointer aliasing; model <LangRef.html#pointeraliasing>`_. * Provide a consistent method for computing addresses so that address; computations don't need to be a part of load and store instructions in the IR. * Support non-C-like languages, to the extent that it doesn't interfere with; other goals. * Minimize target-specific information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======.

Twine is only safe to use; as the argument to a function, and should always be a const reference, e.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. void foo(const Twine &T);; ...; StringRef X = ...; unsigned i = ...; foo(X + ""."" + Twine(i));. This example forms a string like ""blarg.42"" by concatenating the values; together, and does not form intermediate strings containing ""blarg"" or ""blarg."". Because Twine is constructed with temporary objects on the stack, and because; these instances are destroyed at the end of the current statement, it is an; inherently dangerous API. For example, this simple variant contains undefined; behavior and will probably crash:. .. code-block:: c++. void foo(const Twine &T);; ...; StringRef X = ...; unsigned i = ...; const Twine &Tmp = X + ""."" + Twine(i);; foo(Tmp);. ... because the temporaries are destroyed before the call.

Just be aware of their limitations. .. _dss_smallstring:. llvm/ADT/SmallString.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. SmallString is a subclass of :ref:`SmallVector <dss_smallvector>` that adds some; convenience APIs like += that takes StringRef's. SmallString avoids allocating; memory in the case when the preallocated space is enough to hold its data, and; it calls back to general heap allocation when required. Since it owns its data,; it is very safe to use and supports full mutation of the string. Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:74830,efficient,efficient,74830,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

If you do use :option:`-Weverything` then we; advise that you address all new compiler diagnostics as they get added to Clang,; either by fixing everything they find or explicitly disabling that diagnostic; with its corresponding `Wno-` option. Note that when combined with :option:`-w` (which disables all warnings),; disabling all warnings wins. Controlling Static Analyzer Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. While not strictly part of the compiler, the diagnostics from Clang's; `static analyzer <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org>`_ can also be; influenced by the user via changes to the source code.

Precompiled Headers; -------------------. `Precompiled headers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header>`_; are a general approach employed by many compilers to reduce compilation; time. The underlying motivation of the approach is that it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS).

The experience with this algorithm shows; that a compression level of 1.3 for raw data files and around two on; most DST files is the optimum. The choice of one for the default is a; compromise between the time it takes to read and write the object vs.; the disk space savings. To specify no compression, set the level to zero. We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. If the I/O operation is increased; by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it; may compress the data by a factor of 10. On the other hand if the time; spend on I/O is large, compression may have a large impact on the; program's performance. The compression factor, i.e. the savings of disk space, varies with the; type of data. A buffer with a same value array is compressed so that the; value is only written once. For example, a track has the mass of a pion; that it is always the same, and the charge of the pion that is either; positive or negative. For 1000 pions, the mass will be written only; once, and the charge only twice (positive and negative).

A compiler can perform loop optimizations that result in the generated code; executing multiple iterations concurrently. For example, software pipelining; schedules multiple iterations in an interleaved fashion to allow the; instructions of one iteration to hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread.

Main features of **`TObjArray`** are simple, well-known array semantics.; **Overhead per element**: none, except possible over sizing of `fCont`. ## TClonesArray An Array of Identical Objects. A **`TClonesArray`** is an array of identical (clone) objects. The; memory for the objects stored in the array is allocated only once in the; lifetime of the clones array. All objects must be of the same class. For; the rest this class has the same properties as a **`TObjArray`**. ![The internal data structure of a TClonesArray](pictures/020001A8.jpg). The figure above shows the internal data structure of a; **`TClonesArray`**. The class is specially designed for repetitive data; analysis tasks, where in a loop many times the same objects, are created; and deleted. The only supported way to add objects to a; **`TClonesArray`** is via the `new` with placement method. The different; `Add()` methods of **`TObjArray`** and its base classes are not; supported. ### The Idea Behind TClonesArray.

Such uses are replaced with simple calls to the; interfaces provided in ``include/llvm/Support``. Note that the Support Library is not intended to be a complete operating system; wrapper (such as the Adaptive Communications Environment (ACE) or Apache; Portable Runtime (APR)), but only provides the functionality necessary to; support LLVM. The Support Library was originally referred to as the System Library, written; by Reid Spencer who formulated the design based on similar work originating; from the eXtensible Programming System (XPS). Several people helped with the; effort; especially, Jeff Cohen and Henrik Bach on the Win32 port. Keeping LLVM Portable; =====================. In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective. Don't Include System Headers; ----------------------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header. Care has been taken to remove all such ``#includes`` from LLVM; while ``lib/Support`` was being developed. Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used.

If a pointer passed; to our functions does not fit those, something is definitely wrong. - ``""allocation type mismatch""``: when the optional deallocation type mismatch; check is enabled, a deallocation function called on a chunk has to match the; type of function that was called to allocate it. Security implications of such; a mismatch are not necessarily obvious but situational at best;. - ``""invalid sized delete""``: when the C++14 sized delete operator is used, and; the optional check enabled, this indicates that the size passed when; deallocating a chunk is not congruent with the one requested when allocating; it.

To use them, one needs to set the desired number of parallel tasks before calling `fitTo()` as shown below:; ``` {.cpp}; ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(nThreads);; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cuda"")); // can also use ""cuda""; ```. ### User-made PDFs; The easiest and most efficient way of accelerating your PDFs is to request their addition to the official RooFit by submitting a ticket [here](https://git",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md:2648,efficient,efficient,2648,roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,1,['efficient'],['efficient']
Energy Efficiency,"t is usually the call site itself rather than; the return address, i.e. one instruction earlier. When presenting the source; location for a return address frame, the symbolizing filter will subtract one; byte or one instruction length from the actual return address for the call; site, with the intent that the address logged can be translated directly to a; source location for the call site and not for the apparent return site; thereafter (which can be confusing). When inlined functions are involved, the; call site and the return site can appear to be in different functions at; entirely unrelated source locations rather than just a line away, making the; confusion of showing the return site rather the call site quite severe. Often the first frame in a backtrace (""frame zero"") identifies the precise; code location of a fault, trap, or asynchronous interrupt rather than a return; address. At other times, even the first frame is actually a return address; (for example, backtraces collected at the time of an object allocation and; reported later when the allocated object is used or misused). When a system; supports in-thread trap handling, there may also be frames after the first; that represent a precise interrupted code location rather than a return; address, presented as the ""caller"" of a trap handler function (for example,; signal handlers in POSIX systems). Return address frames are identified by the ``:ra`` suffix. Precise code; location frames are identified by the ``:pc`` suffix. Traditional practice has often been to collect backtraces as simple address; lists, losing the distinction between return address code locations and; precise code locations. Some such code applies the ""subtract one"" adjustment; described above to the address values before reporting them, and it's not; always clear or consistent whether this adjustment has been applied or not.; These ambiguous cases are supported by the ``bt`` and ``pc`` forms with no; ``:ra`` or ``:pc`` suffix, which indi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:11656,allocate,allocated,11656,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']
Energy Efficiency,"t is; aligned to a multiple of the second argument.; All of these builtins expect the alignment to be expressed as a number of bytes. These builtins can be used for all integer types as well as (non-function); pointer types. For pointer types, these builtins operate in terms of the integer; address of the pointer and return a new pointer of the same type (including; qualifiers such as ``const``) with an adjusted address.; When aligning pointers up or down, the resulting value must be within the same; underlying allocation or one past the end (see C17 6.5.6p8, C++ [expr.add]).; This means that arbitrary integer values stored in pointer-type variables must; not be passed to these builtins. For those use cases, the builtins can still be; used, but the operation must be performed on the pointer cast to ``uintptr_t``. If Clang can determine that the alignment is not a power of two at compile time,; it will result in a compilation failure. If the alignment argument is not a; power of two at run time, the behavior of these builtins is undefined. Non-standard C++11 Attributes; =============================. Clang's non-standard C++11 attributes live in the ``clang`` attribute; namespace. Clang supports GCC's ``gnu`` attribute namespace. All GCC attributes which; are accepted with the ``__attribute__((foo))`` syntax are also accepted as; ``[[gnu::foo]]``. This only extends to attributes which are specified by GCC; (see the list of `GCC function attributes; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html>`_, `GCC variable; attributes <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html>`_, and; `GCC type attributes; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Type-Attributes.html>`_). As with the GCC; implementation, these attributes must appertain to the *declarator-id* in a; declaration, which means they must go either at the start of the declaration or; immediately after the name being declared. For example, this applies the GNU ``unused`` attribute to ``a`` an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:153225,power,power,153225,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['power'],['power']

Also as above, ptrtoint and inttoptr provide an alternative way to do this which; do not have this restriction. Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow. How can I tell if my front-end is following the rules?; ----------------------------------------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:17611,allocate,allocated,17611,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

The common theme is that, while TableGen allows; you to build domain specific languages, the final languages that you create; lack the power of other DSLs, which in turn increase considerably the size; and complexity of TableGen files. At the same time, TableGen allows you to create virtually any meaning of; the basic concepts via custom-made backends, which can pervert the original; design and make it very hard for newcomers to understand the evil TableGen; file.

The main design goals for the; PROOF system are:. *Transparency* : there should be as little difference as possible; between a local ROOT based analysis session and a remote parallel PROOF; session, both being interactive and giving the same results. *Scalability* : the basic architecture should not put any implicit; limitations on the number of computers that can be used in parallel. *Adaptability* : the system should be able to adapt itself to variations; in the remote environment (changing load on the cluster nodes, network; interruptions, etc.). Being an extension of the ROOT system, PROOF is designed to work on; objects in ROOT data stores, though, for the time being, it mainly; addresses the case of **`TTree`** based object collections. PROOF is primarily meant as an interactive alternative to batch systems; for Central Analysis Facilities and departmental workgroups (Tier-2's).; However, thanks to a multi-tier architecture allowing multiple levels of; masters, it can be easily adapted to wide range virtual clusters; distributed over geographically separated domains and heterogeneous; machines (GRIDs). While pure interactivity might not always be possible when performing a; complicated analysis on a very large data set, PROOF still tries to give; the user the interactive experience with something we call ""interactive; batch"". With ""interactive batch"" the user can start very long running; queries, disconnect the client and at any time, any location and from; any computer reconnect to the query to monitor its progress or retrieve; the results. This feature gives it a distinct advantage over purely; batch based solutions, that only provide an answer once all sub-jobs; have been finished. ![The Multi-tier structure of a PROOF cluster](pictures/03000200.png).

The advantages of std::set are that its iterators are stable (deleting or; inserting an element from the set does not affect iterators or pointers to other; elements) and that iteration over the set is guaranteed to be in sorted order.; If the elements in the set are large, then the relative overhead of the pointers; and malloc traffic is not a big deal, but if the elements of the set are small,; std::set is almost never a good choice. .. _dss_setvector:. llvm/ADT/SetVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

If you suggest changes in a code review, but don't wish the suggestion to be; interpreted this strongly, please state so explicitly. Aim to Make Efficient Use of Everyone's Time; --------------------------------------------. Aim to limit the number of iterations in the review process. For example, when; suggesting a change, if you want the author to make a similar set of changes at; other places in the code, please explain the requested set of changes so that; the author can make all of the changes at once. If a patch will require; multiple steps prior to approval (e.g., splitting, refactoring, posting data; from specific performance tests), please explain as many of these up front as; possible. This allows the patch author and reviewers to make the most efficient; use of their time. LGTM - How a Patch Is Accepted; ------------------------------. A patch is approved to be committed when a reviewer accepts it, and this is; almost always associated with a message containing the text ""LGTM"" (which; stands for Looks Good To Me). Only approval from a single reviewer is required. When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the; responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the discussion and; feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been addressed and; that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with the patch being; approved. If unsure, the reviewer should provide a qualified approval, (e.g.,; ""LGTM, but please wait for @someone, @someone_else"").

Note that mem2reg only works on; variables in certain circumstances:. #. mem2reg is alloca-driven: it looks for allocas and if it can handle; them, it promotes them. It does not apply to global variables or heap; allocations.; #. mem2reg only looks for alloca instructions in the entry block of the; function. Being in the entry block guarantees that the alloca is only; executed once, which makes analysis simpler.; #. mem2reg only promotes allocas whose uses are direct loads and stores.; If the address of the stack object is passed to a function, or if any; funny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers.

For model having operators not yet supported in the Keras parser it is then reccomended to convert the Keras model to `ONNX` using the python `tf2onnx` tool. #### SOFIE PyTorch Parser. If using PyTorch it is recommended to save the model directly in `ONNX` format instad of the native `.pt` format by using the `torch.onnx.export` function of PyTorch. The support for parsing directly `.pt` files is limited to the Gemm, Conv, Relu, Selu, Sigmoid and Transpose operators. #### SOFIE RDataFrame Integration. The SOFIE inference is now integrated with RDataFrame, where a model can be evaluated on the columns of an input `TTree` with `RDataFrame` using the adapter functor class `SofieFunctor`.; Examples of using SOFIE with `RDataFrame` are the new tutorials (in the `tutorials/tmva` directory) `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame.C` or `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame.py`. `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame_JIT.C` is an example where the SOFIE model is generated and compiled at runtime using ROOT Cling and evaluated using RDataFrame. #### RSofieReader. `RSofieReader` is a new class, which takes as input a model file (in ONNX, Keras, PyTorch or ROOT format) and generates and compiles the C++ code for the inference at run time using the ROOT JITing capabilities of CLING. An example of using this class is the tutorial `TMVA_SOFIE_RSofieReader.C`. ### TMVA Pythonizations.

Energy Efficiency,"this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 2, i32 1; %tmp3 = load i32, ptr %tmp2; %tmp4 = add i32 %tmp3, %tmp1; %tmp5 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 0, i32 0; store i32 %tmp4, ptr %tmp5; ret void; }. In each case the second operand is the pointer through which the GEP instruction; starts. The same is true whether the second operand is an argument, allocated; memory, or a global variable. To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global i32; ...; %idx1 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 0; %idx2 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 1; %idx3 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 2. These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the base; address of ``MyVar``. They compute, as follows (using C syntax):. .. code-block:: c++. idx1 = (char*) &MyVar + 0; idx2 = (char*) &MyVar + 4; idx3 = (char*) &MyVar + 8. Since the type ``i32`` is known to be four bytes long, the indices 0, 1 and 2; translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No memory is; accessed to make these computations because the address of ``@MyVar`` is passed; directly to the GEP instructions. The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of ``%idx2`` and ``%idx3``.

For example,; this line fits histogram object `hist` with a Gaussian. ``` {.cpp}; root[] hist.Fit(""gaus"");; ```. The initial parameter values (and eventual limits) for pre-defined functions are set; automatically. For overriding the default limits values use the fit option `B`. The list of pre-defined functions that can be used with the `Fit` method is the following:. - ""`gaus`"" Gaussian function with 3 parameters:; `f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2)`. - ""`expo`""An Exponential with 2 parameters: `f(x) = exp(p0+p1*x)`. - ""`pol`*`N`*"" A polynomial of degree *N*, where N is a number between 0 and 9:; `f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*x2 +...`. - ""`chebyshev`*`N`*"" A Chebyshev polynomial of degree *N*, where N is a number between 0 and 9:; `f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*(2*x2-1) +...`. - ""`landau`"" Landau function with mean and sigma.

If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic,; higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant; runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by `rootreadspeed` (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis; applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and; RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly; when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; See also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PPP138) (slides 16 to 19).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:4721,reduce,reduced,4721,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space. Stack variables; work the same way, except that instead of being declared with global; variable definitions, they are declared with the `LLVM alloca; instruction <../../LangRef.html#alloca-instruction>`_:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @example() {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; ...; %tmp = load i32, i32* %X ; load the stack value %X from the stack.; %tmp2 = add i32 %tmp, 1 ; increment it; store i32 %tmp2, i32* %X ; store it back; ... This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR. Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }.

When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous!

There are several; well-known ways to do this in the literature. LLVM uses a SelectionDAG based; instruction selector. Portions of the DAG instruction selector are generated from the target; description (``*.td``) files. Our goal is for the entire instruction selector; to be generated from these ``.td`` files, though currently there are still; things that require custom C++ code. `GlobalISel <https://llvm.org/docs/GlobalISel/index.html>`_ is another; instruction selection framework. .. _SelectionDAG:.

The SelectionDAG provides an abstraction for code representation in a way that; is amenable to instruction selection using automatic techniques; (e.g. dynamic-programming based optimal pattern matching selectors). It is also; well-suited to other phases of code generation; in particular, instruction; scheduling (SelectionDAG's are very close to scheduling DAGs post-selection).; Additionally, the SelectionDAG provides a host representation where a large; variety of very-low-level (but target-independent) `optimizations`_ may be; performed; ones which require extensive information about the instructions; efficiently supported by the target. The SelectionDAG is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph whose nodes are instances of the; ``SDNode`` class. The primary payload of the ``SDNode`` is its operation code; (Opcode) that indicates what operation the node performs and the operands to the; operation. The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well.

The magic of this class is that it handles small sets extremely efficiently, but; gracefully handles extremely large sets without loss of efficiency. .. _dss_smallptrset:. llvm/ADT/SmallPtrSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``SmallPtrSet`` has all the advantages of ``SmallSet`` (and a ``SmallSet`` of; pointers is transparently implemented with a ``SmallPtrSet``). If more than N; insertions are performed, a single quadratically probed hash table is allocated; and grows as needed, providing extremely efficient access (constant time; insertion/deleting/queries with low constant factors) and is very stingy with; malloc traffic. Note that, unlike :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`, the iterators of ``SmallPtrSet``; are invalidated whenever an insertion occurs. Also, the values visited by the; iterators are not visited in sorted order. .. _dss_stringset:. llvm/ADT/StringSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``StringSet`` is a thin wrapper around :ref:`StringMap\<char\> <dss_stringmap>`,; and it allows efficient storage and retrieval of unique strings. Functionally analogous to ``SmallSet<StringRef>``, ``StringSet`` also supports; iteration. (The iterator dereferences to a ``StringMapEntry<char>``, so you; need to call ``i->getKey()`` to access the item of the StringSet.) On the; other hand, ``StringSet`` doesn't support range-insertion and; copy-construction, which :ref:`SmallSet <dss_smallset>` and :ref:`SmallPtrSet; <dss_smallptrset>` do support. .. _dss_denseset:. llvm/ADT/DenseSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:78966,allocate,allocated,78966,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,2,"['allocate', 'efficient']","['allocated', 'efficient']"

A lot of the ""back end; optimization"" happens right along with other data optimizations (ie, CSE; of machine specific things). As far as REAL back end optimizations go, it looks something like this:. 1. Instruction combination: try to make CISCy instructions, if available; 2. Register movement: try to get registers in the right places for the; architecture to avoid register to register moves. For example, try to get; the first argument of a function to naturally land in %o0 for sparc.; 3. Instruction scheduling: 'nuff said :); 4. Register class preferencing: ??; 5.

A good rule of thumb is that if the matrix condition number is 10n,; the accuracy in `x` is `15` - `n` digits for double precision. Hager devised an iterative method (W.W.

It’s worth noting that the input file; would be passed as a parameter to the test, similar how `-compile-custom`; currently operates. ### Implementation; The tool would behave similar to CReduce’s functionality in that it would have a; list of passes that try to minimize the given test-case. We should be able to; modularize the tool’s behavior, as well as making it easier to maintain and; expand. The first version of this redesign would try to:. * Discard functions, instructions and metadata that don’t influence the; interesting-ness test; * Remove unused parameters from functions; * Eliminate unvisited conditional paths; * Rename variables to more regular ones (such as “a”, “b”, “c”, etc.). Once these passes are implemented, more meaningful reductions (such as type; reduction) would be added to the tool, to even further reduce IR. ## Background on historical bugpoint issues. ### Root Cause Analysis; Presently, bugpoint takes a long time to find the source problem in a given IR; file, mainly due to the fact that it tries to debug the input by running; various strategies to classify the bug, which in turn run multiple optimizer; and compilation passes over the input, taking up a lot of time. Furthermore,; when the IR crashes, it tries to reduce it by performing some sub-optimal; passes (e.g. a lot of unreachable blocks), and sometimes even fails to minimize; at all. ### ""Quirky"" Interface; Bugpoint’s current interface overwhelms and confuses the user, the help screen; alone ends up confusing rather providing guidance. And, not only are there; numerous features and options, but some of them also work in unexpected ways; and most of the time the user ends up using a custom script.

After a few weeks, we had our first; histogramming package in C++. A few weeks later we had a rewrite of; the same package using the, at that time, very new template features; of C++. Again, a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package; without templates since we could only compile the version with; templates on one single platform using a specific compiler. Finally,; after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster; and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK; histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new; technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born; ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has; enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in; all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the; world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences; as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using; ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand; people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper ""The Cathedral and; the Bazaar"" the development method that makes Linux such a success.; The essence of that method is: ""release early, release often and; listen to your customers"". This is precisely how ROOT is being; developed. Over the last five years, many of our ""customers"" became; co-developers.

Other; servers, such as Huawei's, respond with the exact partial content; requested. Therefore, I added the possibility of configuring the; behavior via the ROOT configuration file: the identity of the; servers known to correctly support multi-range requests is; configurable. If the server is known to support this feature, ROOT; will send multi-range requests, otherwise it will issue multiple; single-range GET requests, which is also the default behavior.; - currently the virtual host syntax:; ""s3://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/my/file"" is not supported; but can be added if this is considered useful. The TAS3File class will be removed and should not have been used; directly by users anyway as it was only accessed via the plugin manager; in TFile::Open(). ### New HTTP Server package. A new HTTP Server package has been introduced. The idea behind such server is to provide direct access to the data from a running ROOT application. Any object can be streamed when requested and delivered to the browser. ##### Starting HTTP server. To start http server, at any time create instance; of the **`THttpServer`** class like:. ``` {.cpp}; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; ```. This will start civetweb-based http server on port 8080.; Then, one should be able to open address ""http://localhost:8080""; in any modern browser and browse objects created in application. By default, the server can access files, canvases and histograms via gROOT. All such objects can be displayed with JSRootIO graphics. At any time one could register other objects with the command:. ``` {.cpp}; TGraph* gr = new TGraph(10);; gr->SetName(""gr1"");; serv->Register(""graphs/subfolder"", gr);; ```. If the object content is changing in the application, like for example histograms being continuously filled, one could enable the monitoring flag in the browser, then the object view will be regularly updated.

There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc..

Nontrivially ownership-qualified types are considered non-trivial; to copy, destroy, and default-initialize. A dynamic object of nontrivially ownership-qualified type contingently; exists at a location if the memory is filled with a zero pattern, e.g.; by ``calloc`` or ``bzero``. Such an object can be safely accessed in; all of the cases above, but its memory can also be safely repurposed.; Assigning a null pointer into an l-value of ``__weak`` or; ``__strong``-qualified type accesses the dynamic object there (and thus; may have undefined behavior if no such object exists), but afterwards; the object's memory is guaranteed to be filled with a zero pattern; and thus may be either further accessed or repurposed as needed.; The upshot is that programs may safely initialize dynamically-allocated; memory for nontrivially ownership-qualified types by ensuring it is zero-initialized, and they may safely deinitialize memory before; freeing it by storing ``nil`` into any ``__strong`` or ``__weak``; references previously created in that memory.

Using alias analysis results; ============================. There are several different ways to use alias analysis results. In order of; preference, these are:. Using the ``MemoryDependenceAnalysis`` Pass; -------------------------------------------. The ``memdep`` pass uses alias analysis to provide high-level dependence; information about memory-using instructions. This will tell you which store; feeds into a load, for example. It uses caching and other techniques to be; efficient, and is used by Dead Store Elimination, GVN, and memcpy optimizations. .. _AliasSetTracker:.

First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in.

The ``allocate`` method takes a ``JITLinkDylib*`` representing the target; simulated dylib, a reference to the ``LinkGraph`` that must be allocated for,; and a callback to run once an ``InFlightAlloc`` has been constructed.; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` implementations can (optionally) use the ``JD``; argument to manage a per-simulated-dylib memory pool (since code model; constraints are typically imposed on a per-dylib basis, and not across; dylibs) [2]_. The ``LinkGraph`` describes the object file that we need to; allocate memory for. The allocator must allocate working memory for all of; the Blocks defined in the graph, assign address space for each Block within the; executing processes memory, and update the Blocks' addresses to reflect this; assignment. Block content should be copied to working memory, but does not need; to be transferred to executor memory yet (that will be done once the content is; fixed up). ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` implementations can take full; responsibility for these steps, or use the ``BasicLayout`` utility to reduce; the task to allocating working and executor memory ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:27322,allocate,allocate,27322,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,2,['allocate'],"['allocate', 'allocated']"

In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks.

There are many reasons for doing this: it reduces indentation and factors out; code which can often be shared by other code that checks for the same predicate.; More importantly, it *forces you to pick a name* for the function, and forces; you to write a comment for it.

Disabled lanes are treated as containing the neutral; value (i.e. having no effect on the reduction operation). If the vector length; is zero, the result is the start value. The neutral value is dependent on the :ref:`fast-math flags <fastmath>`. If no; flags are set, the neutral value is ``-QNAN``.

Energy Efficiency,"ved in ROOT 6.34:. * RooAbsTestStatistic; * RooAbsOptTestStatistic; * RooNLLVar; * RooChi2Var; * RooXYChi2Var. Please use the higher-level functions `RooAbsPdf::createNLL()` and `RooAbsPdf::createChi2()` if you want to create objects that represent test statistics. ### Change of RooParamHistFunc. The `RooParamHistFunc` didn't take any observable `RooRealVar` as constructor; argument. It assumes as observable the internal variables in the passed; RooDataHist. This means it was in most contexts unusable, because the input; can't be changed, other than loading a different bin in the dataset. Furthermore, there was actually a constructor that took a `RooAbsArg x`, but it; was simply ignored. To fix all these problems, the existing constructors were replaced by a new one; that takes the observable explicitly. Since the old constructors resulted in wrong computation graphs that caused; trouble with the new CPU evaluation backend, they had to be removed without; deprecation. Please adapt your code if necessary. ### Renaming of some RooFit classes. The `RooPower` was renamed to `RooPowerSum`, and `RooExpPoly` was renamed to `RooLegacyExpPoly`. This was a necessary change, because the names of these classes introduced in ROOT 6.28 collided with some classes in CMS combine, which were around already long before. Therefore, the classes had to be renamed to not cause any problems for CMS.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro9.C; ```. Your present knowledge of ROOT should be enough to understand all the; technicalities behind the macro. Note that the variable `pull` in line; *61* is different from the definition above: instead of the parameter; error on `mean`, the fitted standard deviation of the distribution",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/functions_and_parameter_estimation.md:4274,power,powerful,4274,documentation/primer/functions_and_parameter_estimation.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/functions_and_parameter_estimation.md,1,['power'],['powerful']

Energy Efficiency,"we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one. If not, it returns a null; pointer. This structure is somewhat mystical, but after meditating on it, it will make; sense to you :). .. _QualType:. The ``QualType`` class; ----------------------. The ``QualType`` class is designed as a trivial value class that is small,; passed by-value and is efficient to query. The idea of ``QualType`` is that it; stores the type qualifiers (``const``, ``volatile``, ``restrict``, plus some; extended qualifiers required by language extensions) separately from the types; themselves. ``QualType`` is conceptually a pair of ""``Type*``"" and the bits; for these type qualifiers. By storing the type qualifiers as bits in the conceptual pair, it is extremely; efficient to get the set of qualifiers on a ``QualType`` (just return the field; of the pair), add a type qualifier (which is a trivial constant-time operation; that sets a bit), and remove one or more type qualifiers (just return a; ``QualType`` with the bitfield set to empty). Further, because the bits are stored outside of the type itself, we do not need; to create duplicates of types with different sets of qualifiers (i.e. there is; only a single heap allocated ""``int``"" type: ""``const int``"" and ""``volatile; const int``"" both point to the same heap allocated ""``int``"" type). This; reduces the heap size used to represent bits and also means we do not have to; consider qualifiers when uniquing types (:ref:`Type <Type>` does not even; contain qualifiers). In practice, the two most common type qualifiers (``const`` and ``restrict``); are stored in the low bits of the pointer to the ``Type`` object, together with; a flag indicating whether extended qualifiers are present (which must be; heap-allocated). This means that ``QualType`` is exactly the same size as a; pointer. .. _Declara",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:67009,efficient,efficient,67009,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

This may require some; effort if an extensive caching infrastructure is used in your model. **3. Add translate():** RooFit classes are extended using a (typically) simple; `translate()` function that extracts the mathematically differentiable; properties out of the RooFit classes that make up the statistical model. The `translate()` function helps implement the Code Squashing logic that is; used to optimize numerical evaluations.

The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if the; address is outside the actual underlying allocated object and not the address; one-past-the-end. Without the ``inbounds`` keyword, there are no restrictions on computing; out-of-bounds addresses.

There are no restrictions on bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object.

One should remember that JSON representation always includes names of the data fields which are not present in the binary representation. Even then the size difference is negligible. `root.json` used in JSROOT to request objects from THttpServer. ### Generating images out of objects. For the ROOT classes which are implementing Draw method (like [TH1](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html) or [TGraph](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph.html)) one could produce images with requests: `root.png`, `root.gif`, `root.jpeg`. For example:. ```bash; [shell] wget ""http://localhost:8080/Files/hsimple.root/hpx/root.png?w=500&h=500&opt=lego1"" -O lego1.png; ```. For all such requests following parameters could be specified:. - **h** - image height; - **w** - image width; - **opt** - draw options. ### Methods execution. By default THttpServer starts in monitoring (read-only) mode and therefore forbid any methods execution. One could specify read-write mode when server is started:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080;rw"");; ```. Or one could disable read-only mode with the call:. ```cpp; serv->SetReadOnly(kFALSE);; ```. Or one could allow access to the folder, object or specific object methods with:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Histograms"", ""allow=admin""); // allow full access for user with 'admin' account; serv->Restrict(""/Histograms/hist1"", ""allow=all""); // allow full access for all users; serv->Restrict(""/Histograms/hist1"", ""allow_method=Rebin""); // allow only Rebin method; ```. 'exe.json' accepts following parameters:. - `method` - name of method to execute; - `prototype` - method prototype (see [TClass::GetMethodWithPrototype](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTClass.html#a2bef3a3d4bf3d8f8e97e989b63699746) for details); - `compact` - compact parameter, used to compress return value; - `_ret_object_` - name of the object which should be retu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:18798,monitor,monitoring,18798,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['monitor'],['monitoring']

User convenient typedefs are also provided.; 	They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`.

Integrability," ![ROOT libraries dependencies](pictures/03000005.png). The libraries are designed and organized to minimize dependencies,; such that you can load just enough code for the task at hand rather; than having to load all libraries or one monolithic chunk. The core; library (`libCore.so`) contains the essentials; it is a part of all; ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made; up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes,; operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for; compression of the ROOT files. The Cling library (`libCling.so`) is also needed in all ROOT; applications, and even by `libCore`. A; program referencing only **`TObject`** only needs `libCore`;; `libCling` will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write; ROOT objects one also has to load `libRIO`. As one would expect, none of that; depends on graphics or the GUI. Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether; you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is; defined in a library. #### Linktime Library Dependencies. When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:16892,depend,dependencies,16892,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,2,['depend'],"['dependencies', 'depending']"

Integrability," (e.g. Unix, Win32). No Virtual Methods; ------------------. The Support Library interfaces can be called quite frequently by LLVM. In order; to make those calls as efficient as possible, we discourage the use of virtual; methods. There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------. Any functions defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``); must not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header; file for that function is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard.

ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim* Clone() const; {; return new MyParametricFunction();; }. const double* Parameters() const; {; return pars;; }. void SetParameters(const double* p); {; pars = p;; }. unsigned int NPar() const; {; return 2;; }; };; ```. * **`ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim`**:; Provides an interface for parametric gradient multi-dimensional functions. In addition to function evaluation it provides the gradient with respect to the parameters,; via the method `ParameterGradient()`. This interface is only used in case of some dedicated fitting algorithms, when is required or more efficient to provide derivatives with respect to the; parameters. Here is an example:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h""; #include ""Math/IParamFunction.h"". class MyParametricGradFunction:; public ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim; {; private:; const double* pars;. public:; double DoEvalPar(const double* x, const double* p) const; {; return p[0] * x[0] + sin(x[1]) + p[1];; }. unsigned int NDim() const; {; return 2;; }.

User convenient typedefs are also provided.; 	They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`. In addition the fitter classes make uses of the generic interfaces for parametric function evaluations, `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`; to define the fit model function and use the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface to perform the minimization of the objective function.; More information about the function interface and the multi-dimensional minimization in ROOT is given in the Mathematical Library chapter.

Depending on the `name` argument, the function returns a **`TFile`** or one; of its derivations, for example a; **`TNetXNGFile`** or a **`TDavixFile`** object. In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or; there were wrong input arguments);. - -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used; anymore. ## Remotely Access to ROOT Files. ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running. Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a; **`TFile`** object using the static method **`TFile::Open()`** object.; This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of **`TFile`** to handle the; request. Inheriting from the **`TFile`** class, the returned instance will have; exactly the same interface and behavior of **`TFile`**. The only difference; is that it reads and writes from a remote service.; In the example below the file is read via a web server through the TDavixFile plug-in. ### A Simple Session. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f1 = TFile::Open(""local/file.root"",""update""); root[] TFile *f2 = TFile::Open(""root://my.server.or",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:95601,protocol,protocol,95601,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

One can select the number of points to draw the contour; (more points might require more time to compute it), the parameters and the desired confidence level . * *Scan* : to plot a scan of the minimization function (likelihood or chi-squared) around the minimum as function of the chosen parameter. * *Conf Interval* : to plot the confidence interval of the fitted function as a filled coloured band around its central value.; One can select the desired confidence level for the band to be plotted. ### Print Options. This set of options specifies the amount of feedback printed on the; root command line after performed fits. *‘Verbose'* - prints fit results after each iteration. *‘Quiet'* - no fit information is printed. *‘Default'* - between Verbose and Quiet. ### Command Buttons. *Fit button* - performs a fit taking different option settings via the; Fit Panel interface. *Reset* - sets the GUI elements and related fit settings to the; default ones. *Close* - closes the Fit panel window. ### Minimization Options. With this tab one can select specific options for minimization. These include. * The minimizer library ( *Minuit*, *Minuit2*, *Fumili*, *GSL*, *Genetics* ); * The method (algorithm) for minimization. For example for Minuit one can choose between (*Migrad*, *Simplex* or *Scan*); * Error definition; * Minimization tolerance; * Number of iterations/function calls; * Print Level: (*Default*, *Verbose* or *Quiet*).

This way, a single directory containing multiple variants of modules can be prepared and reused. The options configuring the module cache are independent of other options. Module Semantics; ================. Modules are modeled as if each submodule were a separate translation unit, and a module import makes names from the other translation unit visible. Each submodule starts with a new preprocessor state and an empty translation unit. .. note::. This behavior is currently only approximated when building a module with submodules. Entities within a submodule that has already been built are visible when building later submodules in that module. This can lead to fragile modules that depend on the build order used for the submodules of the module, and should not be relied upon. This behavior is subject to change. As an example, in C, this implies that if two structs are defined in different submodules with the same name, those two types are distinct types (but may be *compatible* types if their definitions match). In C++, two structs defined with the same name in different submodules are the *same* type, and must be equivalent under C++'s One Definition Rule. .. note::. Clang currently only performs minimal checking for violations of the One Definition Rule. If any submodule of a module is imported into any part of a program, the entire top-level module is considered to be part of the program. As a consequence of this, Clang may diagnose conflicts between an entity declared in an unimported submodule and an entity declared in the current translation unit, and Clang may inline or devirtualize based on knowledge from unimported submodules.

Integrability," .. _DeclContext:. Declaration contexts; --------------------. Every declaration in a program exists within some *declaration context*, such; as a translation unit, namespace, class, or function. Declaration contexts in; Clang are represented by the ``DeclContext`` class, from which the various; declaration-context AST nodes (``TranslationUnitDecl``, ``NamespaceDecl``,; ``RecordDecl``, ``FunctionDecl``, etc.) will derive. The ``DeclContext`` class; provides several facilities common to each declaration context:. Source-centric vs. Semantics-centric View of Declarations. ``DeclContext`` provides two views of the declarations stored within a; declaration context. The source-centric view accurately represents the; program source code as written, including multiple declarations of entities; where present (see the section :ref:`Redeclarations and Overloads; <Redeclarations>`), while the semantics-centric view represents the program; semantics. The two views are kept synchronized by semantic analysis while; the ASTs are being constructed. Storage of declarations within that context. Every declaration context can contain some number of declarations. For; example, a C++ class (represented by ``RecordDecl``) contains various member; functions, fields, nested types, and so on. All of these declarations will; be stored within the ``DeclContext``, and one can iterate over the; declarations via [``DeclContext::decls_begin()``,; ``DeclContext::decls_end()``). This mechanism provides the source-centric; view of declarations in the context. Lookup of declarations within that context. The ``DeclContext`` structure provides efficient name lookup for names within; that declaration context. For example, if ``N`` is a namespace we can look; for the name ``N::f`` using ``DeclContext::lookup``. The lookup itself is; based on a lazily-constructed array (for declaration contexts with a small; number of declarations) or hash table (for declaration contexts with more; declarations).

Designing Type Hierarchies and Polymorphic Interfaces; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two different design patterns that tend to result in the use of; virtual dispatch for methods in a type hierarchy in C++ programs. The first is; a genuine type hierarchy where different types in the hierarchy model; a specific subset of the functionality and semantics, and these types nest; strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen in the ``Value``; or ``Type`` type hierarchies. A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of; polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be modeled with; virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract interface base class; which all implementations derive from and override. However, this; implementation strategy forces an **""is-a""** relationship to exist that is not; actually meaningful. There is often not some nested hierarchy of useful; generalizations which code might interact with and move up and down. Instead,; there is a singular interface which is dispatched across a range of; implementations. The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of; generic programming (sometimes called ""compile-time duck typing"" or ""static; polymorphism""). For example, a template over some type parameter ``T`` can be; instantiated across any particular implementation that conforms to the; interface or *concept*. A good example here is the highly generic properties of; any type which models a node in a directed graph.

Integrability," 2. a coroutine resume function that is invoked when the coroutine is resumed,; which takes a pointer to the coroutine object and returns `void`;. 3. a coroutine destroy function that is invoked when the coroutine is; destroyed, which takes a pointer to the coroutine object and returns; `void`. Because the resume and destroy functions are shared across all suspend; points, suspend points must store the index of the active suspend in; the coroutine object, and the resume/destroy functions must switch over; that index to get back to the correct point. Hence the name of this; lowering. Pointers to the resume and destroy functions are stored in the coroutine; object at known offsets which are fixed for all coroutines. A completed; coroutine is represented with a null resume function. There is a somewhat complex protocol of intrinsics for allocating and; deallocating the coroutine object. It is complex in order to allow the; allocation to be elided due to inlining. This protocol is discussed; in further detail below. The frontend may generate code to call the coroutine function directly;; this will become a call to the ramp function and will return a pointer; to the coroutine object. The frontend should always resume or destroy; the coroutine using the corresponding intrinsics. Returned-Continuation Lowering; ------------------------------. In returned-continuation lowering, signaled by the use of; `llvm.coro.id.retcon` or `llvm.coro.id.retcon.once`, some aspects of; the ABI must be handled more explicitly by the frontend. In this lowering, every suspend point takes a list of ""yielded values""; which are returned back to the caller along with a function pointer,; called the continuation function. The coroutine is resumed by simply; calling this continuation function pointer. The original coroutine; is divided into the ramp function and then an arbitrary number of; these continuation functions, one for each suspend point.

Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first argument is a pointer to the destination, the second is a; pointer to the source. The third argument is an integer argument; specifying the number of bytes to copy, and the fourth is a; boolean indicating a volatile access. The :ref:`align <attr_align>` parameter attribute can be provided; for the first and second arguments.

You will recall that ``RecordVal`` is the class whose instances contain; information about the fields in records.

There are multiple overloaded functions, some taking a; ``StringRef`` and others taking a ``const Init *``. Some functions return a; ``RecordVal *`` and others return a ``const RecordVal *``. If the field does; not exist, a fatal error message is printed. More often than not, you are interested in the value of the field, not all; the information in the ``RecordVal``. There is a large set of functions that; take a field name in some form and return its value. One function,; ``getValueInit``, returns the value as an ``Init *``.

For example:. .. code-block:: console. #include <immintrin.h>; // Make an aligned typedef of the AVX-512 16-int vector type.; typedef __v16si __aligned_v16si __attribute__((aligned(64)));. void initialize_vector(__aligned_v16si *v) {; // The compiler may assume that ‘v’ is 64-byte aligned, regardless of the; // value of -fmax-type-align.; }. .. option:: -faddrsig, -fno-addrsig. Controls whether Clang emits an address-significance table into the object; file. Address-significance tables allow linkers to implement `safe ICF; <https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/36912.pdf>`_ without the false; positives that can result from other implementation techniques such as; relocation scanning. Address-significance tables are enabled by default; on ELF targets when using the integrated assembler. This flag currently; only has an effect on ELF targets. .. option:: -f[no]-unique-internal-linkage-names. Controls whether Clang emits a unique (best-effort) symbol name for internal; linkage symbols. When this option is set, compiler hashes the main source; file path from the command line and appends it to all internal symbols. If a; program contains multiple objects compiled with the same command-line source; file path, the symbols are not guaranteed to be unique. This option is; particularly useful in attributing profile information to the correct; function when multiple functions with the same private linkage name exist; in the binary. It should be noted that this option cannot guarantee uniqueness and the; following is an example where it is not unique when two modules contain; symbols with the same private linkage name:. .. code-block:: console. $ cd $P/foo && clang -c -funique-internal-linkage-names name_conflict.c; $ cd $P/ba",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:87053,integrat,integrated,87053,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

In this example, we make and use a simple module ``Hello`` which contains only a; primary module interface unit ``Hello.cppm``. Then let's see a little bit more complex ""hello world"" example which uses the 4 kinds of module units. .. code-block:: c++. // M.cppm; export module M;; export import :interface_part;; import :impl_part;; export void Hello();. // interface_part.cppm; export module M:interface_part;; export void World();. // impl_part.cppm; module;; #include <iostream>; #include <string>; module M:impl_part;; import :interface_part;. std::string W = ""World."";; void World() {; std::cout << W << std::endl;; }. // Impl.cpp; module;; #include <iostream>; module M;; void Hello() {; std::cout << ""Hello "";; }. // User.cpp; import M;; int main() {; Hello();; World();; return 0;; }.

Integrability," C), or if the exception needs to be; forwarded to a prior activation, the exception frame contains information about; how to unwind the current activation and restore the state of the prior; activation. This process is repeated until the exception is handled. If the; exception is not handled and no activations remain, then the application is; terminated with an appropriate error message. Because different programming languages have different behaviors when handling; exceptions, the exception handling ABI provides a mechanism for; supplying *personalities*. An exception handling personality is defined by; way of a *personality function* (e.g. ``__gxx_personality_v0`` in C++),; which receives the context of the exception, an *exception structure*; containing the exception object type and value, and a reference to the exception; table for the current function. The personality function for the current; compile unit is specified in a *common exception frame*. The organization of an exception table is language dependent. For C++, an; exception table is organized as a series of code ranges defining what to do if; an exception occurs in that range. Typically, the information associated with a; range defines which types of exception objects (using C++ *type info*) that are; handled in that range, and an associated action that should take place. Actions; typically pass control to a *landing pad*. A landing pad corresponds roughly to the code found in the ``catch`` portion of; a ``try``/``catch`` sequence. When execution resumes at a landing pad, it; receives an *exception structure* and a *selector value* corresponding to the; *type* of exception thrown. The selector is then used to determine which *catch*; should actually process the exception. LLVM Code Generation; ====================.

Integrability," Cohen and Henrik Bach on the Win32 port. Keeping LLVM Portable; =====================. In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective. Don't Include System Headers; ----------------------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header. Care has been taken to remove all such ``#includes`` from LLVM; while ``lib/Support`` was being developed. Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------. The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Suppor",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:2456,depend,dependent,2456,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependent', 'interfaces']"

Note that each type of vector is constructed by passing its coordinate; representation, so a **`XYZTVector`**`(1,2,3,4)` is different from a; `PtEtaPhiEVector(1,2,3,4)`. In addition, the Vector classes can be; constructed by any vector, which implements the accessors `x()`, `y()`,; `z()` and `t()`.

Reasons for; (2) will be described in the :ref:`limitations`, below. .. code-block:: c++. class Counter {; Mutex mu;; int a GUARDED_BY(mu);. void unsafeIncrement() NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS { a++; }; };. Unlike the other attributes, NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS is not part of the; interface of a function, and should thus be placed on the function definition; (in the ``.cc`` or ``.cpp`` file) rather than on the function declaration; (in the header). RETURN_CAPABILITY(c); --------------------. *Previously*: ``LOCK_RETURNED``. ``RETURN_CAPABILITY`` is an attribute on functions or methods, which declares; that the function returns a reference to the given capability. It is used to; annotate getter methods that return mutexes. .. code-block:: c++. class MyClass {; private:; Mutex mu;; int a GUARDED_BY(mu);. public:; Mutex* getMu() RETURN_CAPABILITY(mu) { return &mu; }. // analysis knows that getMu() == mu; void clear() REQUIRES(getMu()) { a = 0; }; };. ACQUIRED_BEFORE(...), ACQUIRED_AFTER(...); -----------------------------------------. ``ACQUIRED_BEFORE`` and ``ACQUIRED_AFTER`` are attributes on member; declarations, specifically declarations of mutexes or other capabilities.; These declarations enforce a particular order in which the mutexes must be; acquired, in order to",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:11493,interface,interface,11493,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

At most a single ``1`` or ``2`` can be present, and values must be in; ascending order. Examples are:. .. code-block:: c. # 57 // Advance (or return) to line 57 of the current source file; # 57 ""frob"" // Set to line 57 of ""frob""; # 1 ""foo.h"" 1 // Enter ""foo.h"" at line 1; # 59 ""main.c"" 2 // Leave current include and return to ""main.c""; # 1 ""/usr/include/stdio.h"" 1 3 // Enter a system header; # 60 """" 2 // return to ""main.c""; # 1 ""/usr/ancient/header.h"" 1 4 // Enter an implicit extern ""C"" header. Extended Integer Types; ======================. Clang supports the C23 ``_BitInt(N)`` feature as an extension in older C modes; and in C++. This type was previously implemented in Clang with the same; semantics, but spelled ``_ExtInt(N)``. This spelling has been deprecated in; favor of the standard type. Note: the ABI for ``_BitInt(N)`` is still in the process of being stabilized,; so this type should not yet be used in interfaces that require ABI stability. Intrinsics Support within Constant Expressions; ==============================================. The following builtin intrinsics can be used in constant expressions:. * ``__builtin_bitreverse8``; * ``__builtin_bitreverse16``; * ``__builtin_bitreverse32``; * ``__builtin_bitreverse64``; * ``__builtin_bswap16``; * ``__builtin_bswap32``; * ``__builtin_bswap64``; * ``__builtin_clrsb``; * ``__builtin_clrsbl``; * ``__builtin_clrsbll``; * ``__builtin_clz``; * ``__builtin_clzl``; * ``__builtin_clzll``; * ``__builtin_clzs``; * ``__builtin_ctz``; * ``__builtin_ctzl``; * ``__builtin_ctzll``; * ``__builtin_ctzs``; * ``__builtin_ffs``; * ``__builtin_ffsl``; * ``__builtin_ffsll``; * ``__builtin_fmax``; * ``__builtin_fmin``; * ``__builtin_fpclassify``; * ``__builtin_inf``; * ``__builtin_isinf``; * ``__builtin_isinf_sign``; * ``__builtin_isfinite``; * ``__builtin_isnan``; * ``__builtin_isnormal``; * ``__builtin_nan``; * ``__",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:193735,interface,interfaces,193735,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability," Foundation sponsors the server and; provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do. Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on GitHub).; * Inspect the repository history (blame, log, bisect) without Internet access.; * Maintain remote forks and branches on Git hosting services and; integrate back to the main repository. In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today.

Integrability," GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated; placements of relatively few unique ""shapes"". Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of; this by identifying unique logical shapes from the `fID` logical ID; member of **`TBuffer3D`**. If repeated addition of the same `fID` is; found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does; not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL; specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in; these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be; described in **`TBuffer3D`** in the local reference frame, complete with; the local`/`master translation. In some cases you will not have a real; object you can reasonably set **`TBuffer3D::fID` to, or the object is; recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in; these cases, set `TBuffer3D::fID` to 0 (null).**. The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the; **`TVirtualViewer3D`** interface method: `PreferLocalFrame()`. If this; returns `kTRUE` you can make repeated calls to `AddObject()`, with; **`TBuffer3D`** containing the same `fID`, and different `fLocalMaster`; placements. For viewers supporting logical/physical objects, the TBuffer3D content; refers to the properties of the logical object, with the exception of:. - `fLocalMaster` transform. - `fColor `. - `fTransparency`. attributes, which can be varied for **each** physical object. As **a minimum requirement** all clients must be capable of filling the; raw tessellation of the object buffer, in the master reference frame.; Conversely viewers must always be capable of displaying the object; described by this buffer. If either does not meet this requirement the; object may not be displayed. #### Scene Rebuilds. `TBuffer3D::AddObject` is not an explicit command to the viewer - it may; for various reasons decide to ignore it:. - It already has the object internally cached. - The ob",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:135749,interface,interface,135749,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

If you want to avoid checking out all the sources, you can hide the other; directories using a Git sparse checkout::. git config core.sparseCheckout true; echo /compiler-rt > .git/info/sparse-checkout; git read-tree -mu HEAD. The data for all sub-projects is still in your `.git` directory, but in your; checkout, you only see `compiler-rt`.; Before you push, you'll need to fetch and rebase (`git pull --rebase`) as; usual. Note that when you fetch you'll likely pull in changes to sub-projects you don't; care about. If you are using sparse checkout, the files from other projects; won't appear on your disk. The only effect is that your commit hash changes. You can check whether the changes in the last fetch are relevant to your commit; by running::. git log origin/main@{1}..origin/main -- libcxx. This command can be hidden in a script so that `git llvmpush` would perform all; these steps, fail only if such a dependent change exists, and show immediately; the change that prevented the push.

A ``SelectionDAG`` node (``SDNode``) should contain an object representing a; target-specific instruction that is defined in ``XXXInstrInfo.td``. The; instruction objects should represent instructions from the architecture manual; of the target machine (such as the SPARC Architecture Manual for the SPARC; target). A single instruction from the architecture manual is often modeled as multiple; target instructions, depending upon its operands. For example, a manual might; describe an add instruction that takes a register or an immediate operand. An; LLVM target could model this with two instructions named ``ADDri`` and; ``ADDrr``. You should define a class for each instruction category and define each opcode; as a subclass of the category with appropriate parameters such as the fixed; binary encoding of opcodes and extended opcodes. You should map the register; bits to the bits of the instruction in which they are encoded (for the JIT).; Also you should specify how the instruction should be printed when the; automatic assembly printer is used.

For users of the clang driver interface, it is possible to temporarily restore; the old default using the ``-DCLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS=OFF`` cmake option,; or by passing ``-Xclang -no-opaque-pointers`` to a single clang invocation. For users of the clang cc1 interface, ``-no-opaque-pointers`` can be passed.; Note that the ``CLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS`` cmake option has no effect on; the cc1 interface. Usage for LTO can be disabled by passing ``-Wl,-plugin-opt=no-opaque-pointers``; to the clang driver. For users of LLVM as a library, opaque pointers can be disabled by calling; ``setOpaquePointers(false)`` on the ``LLVMContext``. For users of LLVM tools like opt, opaque pointers can be disabled by passing; ``-opaque-pointers=0``. Version Support; ===============. **LLVM 14:** Supports all necessary APIs for migrating to opaque pointers and deprecates/removes incompatible APIs. However, using opaque pointers in the optimization pipeline is **not** fully supported. This release can be used to make out-of-tree code compatible with opaque pointers, but opaque pointers should **not** be enabled in production. **LLVM 15:** Opaque pointers are enabled by default. Typed pointers are still; supported. **LLVM 16:** Opaque pointers are enabled by default. Typed pointers are; supported on a best-effort basis only and not tested. **LLVM 17:** Only ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:11313,interface,interface,11313,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability," Minuit2. The Minuit2 library is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of the popular MINUIT minimization package.; These new version provides basically all the functionality present in the old Fortran version,; with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and computational performances.; Furthermore, it contains new functionality, like the possibility to set single side parameter limits or; the FUMILI algorithm, which is an optimized method for least square and log likelihood minimizations.; The package has been originally developed by M. Winkler and F. James.; More information on the new C++ version can be found on the; MINUIT Web Site. Minuit2, originally developed in the SEAL project, is now distributed within %ROOT.; The API has been then changed in this new version to follow the %ROOT coding convention (function names starting with capital letters) and the classes have been moved inside the namespace ROOT::Minuit2.; In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements the interface; ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2. An example of using this interface is; the %ROOT tutorial tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C or; the Minuit2 test program testMinimize.cxx. A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be downloaded from here. It does not contain the %ROOT interface and it is therefore totally independent of external packages and can be simply build using the configure script and then make. Example tests are provided in the directory test/MnSim and test/MnTutorial and they can be built with the make check command. The Minuit2 User Guide provides all the information needed for using directly (without add-on packages like %ROOT) Minuit2. References. F.

Fix a problem in building the parallel version of Minuit2. The parallel version is built if the environment variables USE_PARALLEL_MINUIT2 and USE_OPENMP are set before compiling Minuit2 on a compiler which supports openMP (for example gcc version >= 4.2); ; Add, thanks to Alfio Lazzaro, support for running Minuit2 using multi-process by using MPI. A new class MPIProcess deals with starting and terminating the MPI process. Each process calculates independently the derivatives for a given set of parameters.; A Minuit2 library with MPI support can be built by defining before compilation the environment variables USE_PARALLEL_MINUIT2 and USE_MPI.

Integrability," Mixed binned/unbinned generation from simultaneous pdf. For a RooSimultaneous consisting of exclusively; extended terms it is now possible to generate a mixed binned/unbinned datasets. Components defined; by a binned pdf at the top level are automatically generated binned (unless AutoBinned(false) is set); but it is also possible to generate other component pdfs forcibly binned by adding GenBinned(tagname); to generate(). In that case all component pdfs labeled with pdf->setAttribute(tagname) will be generated; binned. To generate all component binned, the shorthand method AllBinned() can be used. All binned; datasets made by generate are represented as weighted unbinned datasets (of type RooDataSet) rather; than binned datasets of type RooDataHist so that mixed binned/unbinned data is always represented; through a uniform interface. Fix in the optimization strategy of likelihoods constructed from simultaneous pdf. In the parameter; dependency analysis of the components of a simultaneous pdfs parameters originating from 'irrelevant'; constraint terms (i.e. those that don't relate to any of the parameters of that likelihood component) were; not ignored, which could result in a substantial loss of computational efficiency as likelihood; terms were erroneously recalculated even if no relevant parameters was changed.

Add these lines to your `rootlogon.C`:. ``` {.cpp}; {; ...; // The next line may be unnecessary on some platforms; gSystem->Load(""/usr/lib/libpthread.so"");; gSystem->Load(""$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so"");; ...; }; ```. This loads the library with the **`TThread`** class and the `pthread`; specific implementation file for `Posix` threads. 2. Coding. Define a function (e.g. `void* UserFun(void* UserArgs))` that should run; as a thread. The code for the examples is at the web site of the authors; (Jörn Adamczewski, Marc Hemberger).

Integrability," S. Adve <vadve@cs.uiuc.edu>; To: Chris Lattner <lattner@cs.uiuc.edu>; Subject: another thought. I have a budding idea about making LLVM a little more ambitious: a; customizable runtime system that can be used to implement language-specific; virtual machines for many different languages. E.g., a C vm, a C++ vm, a; Java vm, a Lisp vm, .. The idea would be that LLVM would provide a standard set of runtime features; (some low-level like standard assembly instructions with code generation and; static and runtime optimization; some higher-level like type-safety and; perhaps a garbage collection library). Each language vm would select the; runtime features needed for that language, extending or customizing them as; needed. Most of the machine-dependent code-generation and optimization; features as well as low-level machine-independent optimizations (like PRE); could be provided by LLVM and should be sufficient for any language,; simplifying the language compiler. (This would also help interoperability; between languages.) Also, some or most of the higher-level; machine-independent features like type-safety and access safety should be; reusable by different languages, with minor extensions. The language; compiler could then focus on language-specific analyses and optimizations. The risk is that this sounds like a universal IR -- something that the; compiler community has tried and failed to develop for decades, and is; universally skeptical about. No matter what we say, we won't be able to; convince anyone that we have a universal IR that will work. We need to; think about whether LLVM is different or if has something novel that might; convince people. E.g., the idea of providing a package of separable; features that different languages select from. Also, using SSA with or; without type-safety as the intermediate representation.

Integrability," Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #.

Integrability," Subscripting; ===================. Objective-C object pointer values can now be used with C's subscripting; operator. Examples; --------. The following code demonstrates the use of object subscripting syntax; with ``NSMutableArray`` and ``NSMutableDictionary`` objects:. .. code-block:: objc. NSMutableArray *array = ...;; NSUInteger idx = ...;; id newObject = ...;; id oldObject = array[idx];; array[idx] = newObject; // replace oldObject with newObject. NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = ...;; NSString *key = ...;; oldObject = dictionary[key];; dictionary[key] = newObject; // replace oldObject with newObject. The next section explains how subscripting expressions map to accessor; methods. Subscripting Methods; --------------------. Objective-C supports two kinds of subscript expressions: *array-style*; subscript expressions use integer typed subscripts; *dictionary-style*; subscript expressions use Objective-C object pointer typed subscripts.; Each type of subscript expression is mapped to a message send using a; predefined selector. The advantage of this design is flexibility: class; designers are free to introduce subscripting by declaring methods or by; adopting protocols. Moreover, because the method names are selected by; the type of the subscript, an object can be subscripted using both array; and dictionary styles. Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When the subscript operand has an integral type, the expression is; rewritten to use one of two different selectors, depending on whether; the element is being read or written. When an expression reads an; element using an integral index, as in the following example:. .. code-block:: objc. NSUInteger idx = ...;; id value = object[idx];. it is translated into a call to ``objectAtIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. id value = [object objectAtIndexedSubscript:idx];. When an expression writes an element using an integral index:. .. code-block:: objc. object[idx] = newValue;. it is translated to a ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst:11881,message,message,11881,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability," That resource is; far more complete. In general CMake if blocks work the way you'd expect:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(<condition>); message(""do stuff""); elseif(<condition>); message(""do other stuff""); else(); message(""do other other stuff""); endif(). The single most important thing to know about CMake's if blocks coming from a C; background is that they do not have their own scope. Variables set inside; conditional blocks persist after the ``endif()``. Loops; -----. The most common form of the CMake ``foreach`` block is:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var ...); message(""do stuff""); endforeach(). The variable argument portion of the ``foreach`` block can contain dereferenced; lists, values to iterate, or a mix of both:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var ${my_list}); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var ${my_list} out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds. There is also a more modern CMake foreach syntax. The code below is equivalent; to the code above:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var IN ITEMS foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var IN LISTS my_list ITEMS out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds.

Integrability," The High-Level Issues; ---------------------. Self-contained Headers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in ``.h``.; Non-header files that are meant for inclusion should end in ``.inc`` and be; used sparingly. All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should; not have to adhere to special conditions to include the header. Specifically, a; header should have header guards and include all other headers it needs. There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not; self-contained. These are typically intended to be included at unusual; locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use header; guards, and might not include their prerequisites. Name such files with the; .inc extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when possible. In general, a header should be implemented by one or more ``.cpp`` files. Each; of these ``.cpp`` files should include the header that defines their interface; first. This ensures that all of the dependences of the header have been; properly added to the header itself, and are not implicit. System headers; should be included after user headers for a translation unit. Library Layering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A directory of header files (for example ``include/llvm/Foo``) defines a; library (``Foo``). One library (both; its headers and implementation) should only use things from the libraries; listed in its dependencies. Some of this constraint can be enforced by classic Unix linkers (Mac & Windows; linkers, as well as lld, do not enforce this constraint). A Unix linker; searches left to right through the libraries specified on its command line and; never revisits a library. In this way, no circular dependencies between; libraries can exist. This doesn't fully enforce all inter-library dependencies, and importantly; doesn't enforce header file circular dependencies created by inline functions.; A good way to answer the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:30216,interface,interface,30216,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

One of the things this main program; has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass; command line arguments to Cling.

Integrability," This is unexpected, because one would expect that if two numbers are considered exactly equal, they would also be considered equal within any range.; Therefore, the behavior of `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` was changed to return always `true` if the `==` comparison would return `true`. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Changes in RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf. The TFormula-based RooFit classes `RooFormulaVar` and `RooGenericPdf` change a bit their behavior to be more consistent:. 1. No matter which variables you pass to the constructor, only the variables that the formula depends on are registered as value servers.; 2. Similarly, the `dependents()` method of RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf will only return the list of actual value servers. ### Removal of the RooGenFunction and RooMultiGenFunction classes. The `RooGenFunction` was only a lightweight adaptor that exports a RooAbsReal as a `ROOT::Math::IGenFunction`.; The same can be easily achieved with the generic `ROOT::Math::Functor1D`, so in the spirit of not duplicating interfaces, the `RooGenFunction` is removed in this release.

Integrability," This new default integrator has much improved stability and speed; for relatively smooth p.d.f.s in two or three dimensions and can; generally be used well for p.d.f. normalization integrals without; causing MINUIT converge problems due to numeric precision issues. In future release some more numeric integrators will be migrated to; a MathCore implementation. Interface to TFoam adaptive MC sampler added; RooFit can now use the TFoam adaptive MC sampler for event generation of p.d.f.s that; do not have an internal generator. The TFoam generator adaptively subdivides the; observable space and is generally more efficient both warmup and generation than the original; RooAcceptReject algorithm. In its current interface in RooFit, TFoam cannot; handle problems yet with discrete observables or conditional observables. For those problems; the original RooAcceptReject generator is still used. The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class RooNumGenConfig, which; is similar in style and structure, to RooNumIntConfig which configures the choice of; numeric integration algorithm. A new tutorial macro rf902_numgenconfig.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of the steering. A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the; end of the RooFit section of the release notes. Optional persistent caching of numeric integrals; For p.d.f.s with numeric integrals that remain difficult or very time consuming,; a new persistent caching technique is now available that allows to precalculate; these integrals and store their values for future use. This technique works transparently; for any p.d.f. stored in a RooWorkspace. One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored.

Integrability," This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`.

Integrability," __block int x;; return ^(){ return x; }();; }. By an accident of implementation, GCC and llvm-gcc unintentionally always; zero initialized __block variables.

The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");. Both clang and GAS accept the first instruction: because the first; instruction uses the 8-bit %al register as an operand, it is clear that; it is an 8-bit add. The second instruction is accepted by both because the ""w""; suffix indicates that it is a 16-bit add. The last instruction is accepted by; GAS even though there is nothing that specifies the size of the instruction (and; the assembler randomly picks a 32-bit add). Because it is ambiguous, Clang; rejects the instruction with this error message:. <inline asm>:3:1: error: ambiguous instructions require an explicit suffix (could be 'addb', 'addw', 'addl', or 'addq'); add $4, (%rax); ^.

In the following; example, we create a **`TMessage`** with the intention to store an; object, hence the constant `kMESS_OBJECT` in the constructor. We create; and fill the histogram and write it into the message. Then we call; **`TSocket`**`::Send` to send the message with the histogram. ``` {.cpp}; ...; // create an object to be sent; TH1F *hpx = new TH1F(""hpx"",""px distribution"",100,-4,4);; hpx->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);. // create a TMessage to send the object; TMessage message(kMESS_OBJECT);. // write the histogram into the message buffer; message.WriteObject(hpx);. // send the message; socket->Send(message);; ...; ```.

Integrability," ``ASTNodeImporter::VisitNode()`` functions, e.g. ``VisitFunctionDecl()``.; When we import a declaration then first we import everything which is needed to; call the constructor of that declaration node. Everything which can be set; later is set after the node is created. For example, in case of a; ``FunctionDecl`` we first import the declaration context in which the function; is declared, then we create the ``FunctionDecl`` and only then we import the; body of the function. This means there are implicit dependencies between AST; nodes. These dependencies determine the order in which we visit nodes in the; ""from"" context. As with the regular graph traversal algorithms like DFS, we; keep track which nodes we have already visited in; ``ASTImporter::ImportedDecls``. Whenever we create a node then we immediately; add that to the ``ImportedDecls``. We must not start the import of any other; declarations before we keep track of the newly created one. This is essential,; otherwise, we would not be able to handle circular dependencies. To enforce; this, we wrap all constructor calls of all AST nodes in; ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()``.

It is important to give; names to collections to avoid misleading branch names or identical; branch names. By default collections have a name equal to the; corresponding class name, e.g. the default name of **`TList`** is; ""`TList`"". ## Examples for Writing and Reading Trees. The following sections are examples of writing and reading trees; increasing in complexity from a simple tree with a few variables to a; tree containing folders and complex Event objects. Each example has a; named script in the `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree` directory. They are called; tree1.C to tree4.C. The examples are:. - `tree1.C`: a tree with several simple (integers and floating point); variables. - `tree2.C`: a tree built from a C structure (`struct`). This example; uses the `Geant3` C wrapper as an example of a FORTRAN common block; ported to C with a C structure. - `tree3.C:` in this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a; branch from another tree with the Friends feature. These trees have; branches with variable length arrays. Each entry has a variable; number of tracks, and each track has several variables. - `tree4.C:` a tree with a class (`Event`). The class Event is defined; in `$ROOTSYS/test`. In this example we first encounter the impact of; splitting a branch. Each script contains the main function, with the same name as the file; (i.e. `tree1`), the function to write - `tree1w`, and the function to; read - `tree1r`. If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the; tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you; can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a; specific function. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; // execute the function that writes, reads, shows the tree; root[] x tree1.C; // use ACLiC to build shared library",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:33639,wrap,wrapper,33639,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

For methods; that you do override, in code paths that return a conservative MayAlias or; Mod/Ref result, simply return whatever the superclass computes. For example:. .. code-block:: c++.

Integrability," a function is called from a library or function which cannot; be instrumented. DataFlowSanitizer's ABI list file is a :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`.; The pass treats every function in the ``uninstrumented`` category in the; ABI list file as conforming to the native ABI. Unless the ABI list contains; additional categories for those functions, a call to one of those functions; will produce a warning message, as the labelling behavior of the function; is unknown. The other supported categories are ``discard``, ``functional``; and ``custom``. * ``discard`` -- To the extent that this function writes to (user-accessible); memory, it also updates labels in shadow memory (this condition is trivially; satisfied for functions which do not write to user-accessible memory). Its; return value is unlabelled.; * ``functional`` -- Like ``discard``, except that the label of its return value; is the union of the label of its arguments.; * ``custom`` -- Instead of calling the function, a custom wrapper ``__dfsw_F``; is called, where ``F`` is the name of the function. This function may wrap; the original function or provide its own implementation. This category is; generally used for uninstrumentable functions which write to user-accessible; memory or which have more complex label propagation behavior. The signature; of ``__dfsw_F`` is based on that of ``F`` with each argument having a; label of type ``dfsan_label`` appended to the argument list. If ``F``; is of non-void return type a final argument of type ``dfsan_label *``; is appended to which the custom function can store the label for the; return value.

Integrability," a global; `TMutex` instance for locking. The user may also define their own **`TMutex`** `MyMutex` instance and may; locally protect their asynchronous actions by calling `MyMutex.Lock()` and; `MyMutex.UnLock().`. #### Synchronous Actions: TCondition. To synchronize the actions of different threads you can use the; **`TCondition`** class, which provides a signaling mechanism. The; **`TCondition`** instance must be accessible by all threads that need to; use it, i.e. it should be a global object (or a member of the class; which owns the threaded methods, see below). To create a; **`TCondition`** object, a **`TMutex`** instance is required for the; Wait and `TimedWait` locking methods. One can pass the address of an; external mutex to the **`TCondition`** constructor:. ``` {.cpp}; TMutex MyMutex;; TCondition MyCondition(&MyMutex);; ```. If zero is passed, **`TCondition`** creates and uses its own internal; mutex:. ``` {.cpp}; TCondition MyCondition(0);; ```. You can now use the following methods of synchronization:. - `TCondition::Wait()` waits until any thread sends a signal of the; same condition instance: `MyCondition.Wait()` reacts on; `MyCondition.Signal()` or `MyCondition.Broadcast()`.; `MyOtherCondition.Signal()` has no effect. - If several threads wait for the signal from the same; **`TCondition`** `MyCondition`, at `MyCondition.Signal()` only one; thread will react; to activate a further thread another; `MyCondition.Signal()` is required, etc. - If several threads wait for the signal from the same; **`TCondition`** `MyCondition`, at `MyCondition.Broadcast()` all; threads waiting for `MyCondition` are activated at once. In some tests of `MyCondition` using an internal mutex, `Broadcast()`; activated only one thread (probably depending whether `MyCondition` had; been signaled before). - `MyCondition.TimedWait(secs,nanosecs)` waits for `MyCondition` until; the *absolute* time in seconds and nanoseconds since beginning of; the epoch (January, 1st, 1970) is reache",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md:8278,synchroniz,synchronization,8278,documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronization']

Integrability," a resumption of a coroutine stopped at the final suspend point leads to; undefined behavior. The only possible action for a coroutine at a final; suspend point is destroying it via `coro.destroy`_ intrinsic. From the user perspective, the final suspend point represents an idea of a; coroutine reaching the end. From the compiler perspective, it is an optimization; opportunity for reducing number of resume points (and therefore switch cases) in; the resume function. The following is an example of a function that keeps resuming the coroutine; until the final suspend point is reached after which point the coroutine is; destroyed:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @main() {; entry:; %hdl = call ptr @f(i32 4); br label %while; while:; call void @llvm.coro.resume(ptr %hdl); %done = call i1 @llvm.coro.done(ptr %hdl); br i1 %done, label %end, label %while; end:; call void @llvm.coro.destroy(ptr %hdl); ret i32 0; }.

You can find examples of this technique in; the ``PassManager.h`` system, and there is a more detailed introduction to it; by Sean Parent in several of his talks and papers:. #. `Inheritance Is The Base Class of Evil; <http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Inheritance-Is-The-Base-Class-of-Evil>`_; - The GoingNative 2013 talk describing this technique, and probably the best; place to start.; #. `Value Semantics and Concepts-based Polymorphism; <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BpMYeUFXv8>`_ - The C++Now! 2012 talk; describing this technique in more detail.; #. `Sean Parent's Papers and Presentations; <http://github.com/sean-parent/sean-parent.github.com/wiki/Papers-and-Presentations>`_; - A GitHub project full of links to slides, video, and sometimes code. When deciding between creating a type hierarchy (with either tagged or virtual; dispatch) and using templates or concepts-based polymorphism, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code. We have also found that a large; amount of our usage of type hierarchies fits better ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:131924,interface,interface,131924,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability," actually in the autorelease pool. ARC performs no extra mandatory work on the caller side, although it may elect; to do something to shorten the lifetime of the returned value. .. admonition:: Rationale. It is common in non-ARC code to not return an autoreleased value; therefore; the convention does not force either path. It is convenient to not be; required to do unnecessary retains and autoreleases; this permits; optimizations such as eliding retain/autoreleases when it can be shown that; the original pointer will still be valid at the point of return. A method or function may be marked with; ``__attribute__((ns_returns_autoreleased))`` to indicate that it returns a; pointer which is guaranteed to be valid at least as long as the innermost; autorelease pool. There are no additional semantics enforced in the definition; of such a method; it merely enables optimizations in callers. .. _arc.objects.operands.casts:. Bridged casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A :arc-term:`bridged cast` is a C-style cast annotated with one of three; keywords:. * ``(__bridge T) op`` casts the operand to the destination type ``T``. If; ``T`` is a retainable object pointer type, then ``op`` must have a; non-retainable pointer type. If ``T`` is a non-retainable pointer type,; then ``op`` must have a retainable object pointer type. Otherwise the cast; is ill-formed. There is no transfer of ownership, and ARC inserts no retain; operations.; * ``(__bridge_retained T) op`` casts the operand, which must have retainable; object pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a non-retainable; pointer type. ARC retains the value, subject to the usual optimizations on; local values, and the recipient is responsible for balancing that +1.; * ``(__bridge_transfer T) op`` casts the operand, which must have; non-retainable pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a; retainable object pointer type.

Notice that ``Square::classof`` does not need to be changed. .. _classof-contract:. The Contract of ``classof``; ---------------------------. To be more precise, let ``classof`` be inside a class ``C``. Then the; contract for ``classof`` is ""return ``true`` if the dynamic type of the; argument is-a ``C``"". As long as your implementation fulfills this; contract, you can tweak and optimize it as much as you want.

Use compiler wrappers to make actions.; The compiler wrappers does run the real compiler and the analyzer.; This is the default behaviour, can be enforced with `--override-compiler`; flag. 2. Use special library to intercept compiler calls during the build process.; The analyzer run against each modules after the build finished.; Use `--intercept-first` flag to get this model. 3. Use compiler wrappers to intercept compiler calls during the build process.; The analyzer run against each modules after the build finished.; Use `--intercept-first` and `--override-compiler` flags together to get; this model. The 1. and 3. are using compiler wrappers, which works only if the build; process respects the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables. (Some build; process can override these variable as command line parameter only. This case; you need to pass the compiler wrappers manually. eg.: `intercept-build; --override-compiler make CC=intercept-cc CXX=intercept-c++ all` where the; original build command would have been `make all` only.). The 1. runs the analyzer right after the real compilation. So, if the build; process removes removes intermediate modules (generated sources) the analyzer; output still kept.

Integrability," are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers.

The ROOT graphics editor loads the corresponding object editor; `objEditor` according to the selected object `obj` in the canvas; respecting the class inheritance. An object in the canvas is selected; after the left mouse click on it. For example, if the selected object; is **`TAxis`**, the **`TAxisEditor`** will shows up in the editor; frame giving the possibility for changing different axis attributes.; The graphics editor can be:. Embedded - connected only with the canvas in the application window; that appears on the left of the canvas window after been activated via; View menu / Editor. It appears on the left side if the canvas window; allowing users to edit the attributes of the selected object via; provided user interface.

If the user interface; needs more space then the height of the canvas window, a vertical; scroll bar appears for easer navigation. ![](pictures/03000027.png).

This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class.

This metadata disables all optional loop transformations unless; explicitly instructed using other transformation metadata such as; ``llvm.loop.unroll.enable``. That is, no heuristic will try to determine; whether a transformation is profitable. The purpose is to avoid that the; loop is transformed to a different loop before an explicitly requested; (forced) transformation is applied. For instance, loop fusion can make; other transformations impossible. Mandatory loop canonicalizations such; as loop rotation are still applied. It is recommended to use this metadata in addition to any llvm.loop.*; transformation directive. Also, any loop should have at most one; directive applied to it (and a sequence of transformations built using; followup-attributes). Otherwise, which transformation will be applied; depends on implementation details such as the pass pipeline order. See :ref:`transformation-metadata` for details.

These metadata should be used in; conjunction with ``llvm.loop`` loop identification metadata.

We specify that this is a; simple scalar option by using the ""``cl::opt``"" template (as opposed to the; ""``cl::list``"" template), and tell the CommandLine library that the data; type that we are parsing is a string. The second and third parameters (which are optional) are used to specify what to; output for the ""``-help``"" option. In this case, we get a line that looks like; this:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options]. OPTIONS:; -h - Alias for -help; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename. Because we specified that the command line option should parse using the; ``string`` data type, the variable declared is automatically usable as a real; string in all contexts that a normal C++ string object may be used. For; example:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; std::ofstream Output(OutputFilename.c_str());; if (Output.good()) ...; ... There are many different options that you can use to customize the command line; option handling library, but the above example shows the general interface to; these options. The options can be specified in any order, and are specified; with helper functions like `cl::desc(...)`_, so there are no positional; dependencies to remember. The available options are discussed in detail in the; `Reference Guide`_. Continuing the example, we would like to have our compiler take an input; filename as well as an output filename, but we do not want the input filename to; be specified with a hyphen (ie, not ``-filename.c``). To support this style of; argument, the CommandLine library allows for `positional`_ arguments to be; specified for the program. These positional arguments are filled with command; line parameters that are not in option form. We use this feature like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));.

Integrability," as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============. The compound statement of a Block is treated much like a function body; with respect to control flow in that goto, break, and continue do not; escape the Block. Exceptions are treated *normally* in that when; thrown they pop stack frames until a catch clause is found. Objective-C Extensions; ======================. Objective-C extends the definition of a Block reference type to be; that also of id. A variable or expression of Block type may be; messaged or used as a parameter wherever an id may be. The converse is; also true. Block references may thus appear as properties and are; subject to the assign, retain, and copy attribute logic that is; reserved for objects.

Otherwise git shows the file as untracked, unless you explicitly remove their tracking yourself with a .gitignore file. ## Building a tarball. Minuit2 standalone also has support for CPack to make installers for different platforms. To build a source package:. ```bash; make package_source; ```. This will create a source file in several formats that you can distribute. Reminder: You **must** have used `-Dminuit2_standalone=ON` when you configured CMake, or many of the files will be missing. ## Building a binary. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make; make package; ```. ## Maintenance. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to [ROOT], they should be added to the source files lists in `src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Minuit2/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). For testing, the main `test/CMakeLists.txt` is used by ROOT, and the `test/*/CMakeLists.txt` files are used by the standalone build. ## How it works. Extracting from the ROOT sources is made possible through a few careful design features:. * A CMake variable `minuit2_inroot` lets the build system know we are inside ROOT (it looks for `../../build/version_info`); * All files that are not part of the minuit2 directory are passed into `copy_standalone`, and that handles selecting the correct location; * `copy_standalone` copies the files into the minuit2 source directory if `minuit2_standalone` is `ON`. After this happens, all the standard CMake machinery can produce the source distribution. And, CMake correctly builds and installs in either mode, since all source and header files are explicitly listed.

By default AddressSanitizer inlines the instrumentation code to improve the; run-time performance, which leads to increased binary size. Using the; (clang flag ``-fsanitize-address-outline-instrumentation` default: ``false``); flag forces all code instrumentation to be outlined, which reduces the size; of the generated code, but also reduces the run-time performance. Limitations; ===========. * AddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. Exact overhead; depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the allocations you make the; bigger the overhead is.; * AddressSanitizer uses more stack memory. We have seen up to 3x increase.; * On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves) 16+ Terabytes of; virtual address space. This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as; usually expected.; * Static linking of executables is not supported. Supported Platforms; ===================. AddressSanitizer is supported on:. * Linux i386/x86\_64 (tested on Ubuntu 12.04); * macOS 10.7 - 10.11 (i386/x86\_64); * iOS Simulator; * Android ARM; * NetBSD i386/x86\_64; * FreeBSD i386/x86\_64 (tested on FreeBSD 11-current); * Windows 8.1+ (i386/x86\_64). Ports to various other platforms are in progress. Current Status; ==============. AddressSanitizer is fully functional on supported platforms starting from LLVM; 3.1. The test suite is integrated into CMake build and can be run with ``make; check-asan`` command.

ARC may assume that non-ARC code engages in sensible balancing; behavior and does not rely on exact or minimum retain count values; except as guaranteed by ``__strong`` object invariants or +1 transfer; conventions.

ARC may not allow a retainable object ``X`` to be deallocated at a; time ``T`` in a computation history if:. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; :ref:`precise lifetime semantics <arc.optimization.precise>`, or. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; imprecise lifetime semantics and, at some point after ``T`` but; before the next store to ``S``, the computation history features a; load from ``S`` and in some way depends on the value loaded, or. * ``X`` is a value described as being released at the end of the; current full-expression and, at some point after ``T`` but before; the end of the full-expression, the computation history depends; on that value. .. admonition:: Rationale.

The most common form of the CMake ``foreach`` block is:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var ...); message(""do stuff""); endforeach(). The variable argument portion of the ``foreach`` block can contain dereferenced; lists, values to iterate, or a mix of both:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var ${my_list}); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var ${my_list} out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds. There is also a more modern CMake foreach syntax. The code below is equivalent; to the code above:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var IN ITEMS foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var IN LISTS my_list ITEMS out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds.

Integrability," bitstream file format and the encoding of the; LLVM IR into it. Overview; ========. What is commonly known as the LLVM bitcode file format (also, sometimes; anachronistically known as bytecode) is actually two things: a `bitstream; container format`_ and an `encoding of LLVM IR`_ into the container format. The bitstream format is an abstract encoding of structured data, very similar to; XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested; structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags.; Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it; provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe ""abbreviations"", which are; effectively size optimizations for the content. LLVM IR files may be optionally embedded into a `wrapper`_ structure, or in a; `native object file`_. Both of these mechanisms make it easy to embed extra; data along with LLVM IR files. This document first describes the LLVM bitstream format, describes the wrapper; format, then describes the record structure used by LLVM IR files. .. _bitstream container format:. Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:. Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number. Generic bitcode tools may look at the first four bytes to determine; whether the stream is a known stream t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst:1193,wrap,wrapper,1193,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']
Integrability," bots and nightly; testing infrastructure normally finds these problems. A good rule of thumb is; to check the nightly testers for regressions the day after your change. Build; bots will directly email you if a group of commits that included yours caused a; failure. You are expected to check the build bot messages to see if they are; your fault and, if so, fix the breakage. Commits that violate these quality standards (e.g. are very broken) may be; reverted. This is necessary when the change blocks other developers from making; progress. The developer is welcome to re-commit the change after the problem has; been fixed. .. _commit messages:. Commit messages; ---------------. Although we don't enforce the format of commit messages, we prefer that; you follow these guidelines to help review, search in logs, email formatting; and so on. These guidelines are very similar to rules used by other open source; projects. Most importantly, the contents of the message should be carefully written to; convey the rationale of the change (without delving too much in detail). It; also should avoid being vague or overly specific. For example, ""bits were not; set right"" will leave the reviewer wondering about which bits, and why they; weren't right, while ""Correctly set overflow bits in TargetInfo"" conveys almost; all there is to the change. Below are some guidelines about the format of the message itself:. * Separate the commit message into title and body separated by a blank line. * If you're not the original author, ensure the 'Author' property of the commit is; set to the original author and the 'Committer' property is set to yourself.; You can use a command similar to; ``git commit --amend --author=""John Doe <jdoe@llvm.org>""`` to correct the; author property if it is incorrect.

The table shows that of the 900; instructions processed, there were 900 mappings created. Since this dot-product; example utilized only floating point registers, the JFPuPRF was responsible for; creating the 900 mappings.

Integrability," can control the relative and absolute tolerance and the maximum allowed number of function evaluation. #### `ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegrator`. It is a class for performing numerical integration of a multidimensional function. It uses the numerical integration algorithms of GSL, which reimplements the algorithms used; in the QUADPACK, a numerical integration package written in Fortran. Plain MC, MISER and VEGAS integration algorithms are supported for integration over finite (hypercubic) ranges.; For a detail description of the GSL methods visit the GSL users guide.; Specific configuration options (documented in the GSL user guide) for the `ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegration` can be set directly in the class, or when using it via the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`; interface, can be defined using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`. ## Function Derivation. There are in ROOT only two classes to perform numerical derivation. One of them is in the MathCore library while the other is in the MathMore wrapping an integration function from the GSL library.; * RichardsonDerivator: Implements the Richardson method for numerical integration. It can calculate up to the third derivative of a function.; * GSLDerivator of *MathMore* based on GSL. ## Numerical Minimization. The algorithms provided by ROOT for numerical integration are implemented following the hierarchy shown in the next image. The left branch of classes are used for one dimensional minimization, while; the right one is used for multidimensional minimization. In the case of multidimensional minimization we have also the classes `TMinuitMinimizer` implemented using `TMinuit`, `TFumiliMinimizer`; implemented using `TFumili` for least square or likelihood minimizations.; We encourage the use of the GSL algorithms for one dimensional minimization and `Minuit2` (or the old version`Minuit`) for multi dimensional minimization. ![Numerical Minimization classes](pictures/Minimization.png). ### One-Dimensional Minimization.

Integrability," can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data. Here is an example,; extracted and simplified from the Project Zero paper:; ```; struct array {; unsigned long length;; unsigned char data[];; };; struct array *arr1 = ...; // small array; struct array *arr2 = ...; // array of size 0x400; unsigned long untrusted_offset_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_offset_from_caller < arr1->length) {; unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset_from_caller];; unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200;; unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];; }; ```. The key of the attack is to call this with `untrusted_offset_from_caller` that; is far outside of the bounds when the branch predictor will predict that it; will be in-bounds. In that case, the body of the `if` will be executed; speculatively, and may read secret data into `value` and leak it via a; cache-timing side channel when a dependent access is made to populate `value2`. ## High Level Mitigation Approach. While several approaches are being actively pursued to mitigate specific; branches and/or loads inside especially risky software (most notably various OS; kernels), these approaches require manual and/or static analysis aided auditing; of code and explicit source changes to apply the mitigation. They are unlikely; to scale well to large applications. We are proposing a comprehensive; mitigation approach that would apply automatically across an entire program; rather than through manual changes to the code. While this is likely to have a; high performance cost, some applications may be in a good position to take this; performance / security tradeoff.

This gives an O(10%) performance improvement for some typical RDataFrame scenarios with 256 threads due to reduced lock contention. ## I/O Libraries. - Exclusive use of the global lock is reduced or migrated to finer grained read and write locks in a few hotspots that occur during file opening/closing or task initialization in RDataFrame. This can lead to O(100x) improvements for some typical RDataFrame scenarios with 256 threads due to massively reduced lock contention. ## TTree Libraries. - `TTree` now supports the inclusion of leaves of types `long` and `unsigned long` (and therefore also `std::size_t` on most systems) also for branches in ""leaflist mode"". The corresponding leaflist letters are 'G' and 'g'.; - when looping over a `TTree` with a friend with a larger number of entries, `TTreeReader` now ends the event loop when the entries in the _main_ `TTree` are exhausted, consistently with other interfaces. See [#6518](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6518) for more details.; - `TTreeProcessorMT::SetMaxTasksPerFilePerWorker` is now deprecated in favor of the more flexible and newly introduced `TTreeProcessorMT::SetTasksPerWorkerHint`. See the relevant entries in our reference guide for more information.; - The name of the sub-branches of a split collection no longer have 2 consecutive dots if the top level branche name has a trailing dot. The name of the collection's index leaf also no longer include the dot.

Its goal is to; replace the old Fit Panel and to provide more user friendly way for; performing, exploring and comparing fits. By design, this user interface is planned to contain two tabs:; ""General"" and ""Minimization"". Currently, the ""General"" tab provides; user interface elements for setting the fit function, fit method and; different fit, draw, print options.; The ""Minimization tab"" provides the option to set the Minimizer to use in the fit and; its specific options. The new fit panel is a modeless dialog, i.e. when opened, it does not; prevent users from interacting with other windows. Its first prototype; is a singleton application. When the Fit Panel is activated, users can; select an object for fitting in the usual way, i.e. by left-mouse; click on it. If the selected object is suitable for fitting, the fit; panel is connected with this object and users can perform fits by; setting different parameters and options. ### Function Choice and Settings. *‘Predefined' combo box* - contains a list of predefined functions in; ROOT.

Integrability," class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors. There are additional areas that LLVM does not directly address:. * Registration of global roots with the runtime. * Registration of stack map entries with the runtime. * The functions used by the program to allocate memory, trigger a collection,; etc. * Computation or compilation of type maps, or registration of them with the; runtime.

In addition, in order to have a common entry point, interfaces classes for these numerical algorithms have been; included.; These interfaces are as well implemented by classes using the GSL library and located in the MathMore library. The library can be loaded automatically using the ROOT plug-in manager.; In detail, the new classes containing implementations present previously in TF1 are:. ; GaussIntegrator and GaussLegendreIntegrator for numerical integration of one-dimensional functions. The first class uses Gaussian 8 and 16 point quadrature approximation, it provides the translation of the CERNLIB algorithm; DGAUSS by Sigfried Kolbig, and it is used by the TF1::Integral method. The second one uses the Gauss Legendre quadrature formula. It is used by the TF1::IntegralFast method.; These classes implement both the same virtual interface as the adaptive integration methods provided by the MathMore library. They can all be created and used easily via the common class ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim providing the interfaces for numerical integration.; New template methods have been also included in the common Integration class in order to be able to integrate automatically any C++ callable object. ROOT::Math::RichardsonDerivator implementing numerical derivation using the Richardson's extrapolation formula (use 2 derivative estimates to compute a third, more accurate estimation). This is used by the TD1::Derivative method. ; BrentRootFinder for finding the root of one-dimensional function using the Brent algorithm. The class inherits from a virtual interface, which is also implemented by the MathMore root finder methods. The user can instantiate, via the common ROOT::Math::RootFinder class, all the various root finder algorithms.

We have now the possibility to specify a different integration algorithm in the constructor of the `ROOT::Math::GSLIntegrator` class.; ```{.cpp}; // create the adaptive integrator with the 51 point rule; ROOT::Math::GSLIntegrator ig(ROOT::Math::Integration::kADAPTIVE, ROOT::Math::Integration::kGAUSS51);; ig.SetRelTolerance(1.E-6); // set relative tolerance; ig.SetAbsTolerance(1.E-6); // set absoulte tolerance; ```. The algorithm is controlled by the given absolute and relative tolerance. The iterations are continued until the following condition is satisfied; $$; absErr <= max ( epsAbs, epsRel * Integral); $$; Where *absErr* is an estimate of the absolute error (it can be retrieved with `GSLIntegrator::Error()`) and *Integral* is the estimate of the function integral; (it can be obtained with `GSLIntegrator::Result()`). The possible integration algorithm types to use with the GSLIntegrator are the following. More information is provided in the `GSL` users documentation.; * `ROOT::Math::Integration::kNONADAPTIVE` : based on `gsl_integration_qng`. It is a non-adaptive procedure which uses fixed Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson abscissae; to sample the integrand at a maximum of 87 points. It is provided for fast integration of smooth functions.; * `ROOT::Math::Integration::kADAPTIVE`: based on `gsl_integration_qag`. It is an adaptiva Gauss-Kronrod integration algorithm, the integration region is divided into subintervals, and on each; iteration the subinterval with the largest estimated error is bisected. It is possible to specify the integration rule as an extra enumeration parameter.

Objective-C++ ABI: protocol-qualifier mangling of parameters; ------------------------------------------------------------. Starting with LLVM 3.4, Clang produces a new mangling for parameters whose; type is a qualified-``id`` (e.g., ``id<Foo>``). This mangling allows such; parameters to be differentiated from those with the regular unqualified ``id``; type. This was a non-backward compatible mangling change to the ABI.

This construct is useful because there is no way to separately initialize the; real and imaginary parts of a complex variable in standard C, given that clang; does not support ``_Imaginary``. (Clang also supports the ``__real__`` and; ``__imag__`` extensions from gcc, which help in some cases, but are not usable; in static initializers.). Note that this extension does not allow eliding the braces; the meaning of the; following two lines is different:. .. code-block:: c++. complex float x[] = { { 1.0f, 1.0f } }; // [0] = (1, 1); complex float x[] = { 1.0f, 1.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:84082,protocol,protocol-qualified,84082,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['protocol'],['protocol-qualified']

Note that AMD Jaguar implements; three schedulers:. * JALU01 - A scheduler for ALU instructions.; * JFPU01 - A scheduler floating point operations.; * JLSAGU - A scheduler for address generation. The dot-product is a kernel of three floating point instructions (a vector; multiply followed by two horizontal adds). That explains why only the floating; point scheduler appears to be used. A full scheduler queue is either caused by data dependency chains or by a; sub-optimal usage of hardware resources. Sometimes, resource pressure can be; mitigated by rewriting the kernel using different instructions that consume; different scheduler resources.

LLVM project/subproject headers (``clang/...``, ``lldb/...``, ``llvm/...``, etc); #. System ``#include``\s. and each category should be sorted lexicographically by the full path. The `Main Module Header`_ file applies to ``.cpp`` files which implement an; interface defined by a ``.h`` file. This ``#include`` should always be included; **first** regardless of where it lives on the file system. By including a; header file first in the ``.cpp`` files that implement the interfaces, we ensure; that the header does not have any hidden dependencies which are not explicitly; ``#include``\d in the header, but should be. It is also a form of documentation; in the ``.cpp`` file to indicate where the interfaces it implements are defined. LLVM project and subproject headers should be grouped from most specific to least; specific, for the same reasons described above. For example, LLDB depends on; both clang and LLVM, and clang depends on LLVM. So an LLDB source file should; include ``lldb`` headers first, followed by ``clang`` headers, followed by; ``llvm`` headers, to reduce the possibility (for example) of an LLDB header; accidentally picking up a missing include due to the previous inclusion of that; header in the main source file or some earlier header file. clang should; similarly include its own headers before including llvm headers.

If you are interested in; implementing a new `code generation algorithm`_, it should only depend on the; target-description and machine code representation classes, ensuring that it is; portable. Required components in the code generator; -----------------------------------------. The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the; code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build; target-specific backends. The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used. This design has two important implications. The first is that LLVM can support; completely non-traditional code generation targets. For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release.

Integrability," computed dividing the total number of simulated instructions by the total; number of cycles. Field *Block RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the block throughput. Block; throughput is a theoretical quantity computed as the maximum number of blocks; (i.e. iterations) that can be executed per simulated clock cycle in the absence; of loop carried dependencies. Block throughput is superiorly limited by the; dispatch rate, and the availability of hardware resources. In the absence of loop-carried data dependencies, the observed IPC tends to a; theoretical maximum which can be computed by dividing the number of instructions; of a single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field 'uOps Per Cycle' is computed dividing the total number of simulated micro; opcodes by the total number of cycles. A delta between Dispatch Width and this; field is an indicator of a performance issue. In the absence of loop-carried; data dependencies, the observed 'uOps Per Cycle' should tend to a theoretical; maximum throughput which can be computed by dividing the number of uOps of a; single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field *uOps Per Cycle* is bounded from above by the dispatch width. That is; because the dispatch width limits the maximum size of a dispatch group. Both IPC; and 'uOps Per Cycle' are limited by the amount of hardware parallelism. The; availability of hardware resources affects the resource pressure distribution,; and it limits the number of instructions that can be executed in parallel every; cycle.

Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }.

Doing this may break the ABI if the parameter is not ``__bidi_indexable`` at the; definition of function ``bar()`` which is likely the case because parameters are; ``__single`` by default without an explicit annotation.

Builtin arrays are supported through arrays from module ``array`` (or any; other builtin-type array that implements the Python buffer interface, such; as numpy arrays) and a low-level view type from ``cppyy`` for returns and; variable access (that implements the buffer interface as well).; Out-of-bounds checking is limited to those cases where the size is known at; compile time.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Concrete; >>> from array import array; >>> c = Concrete(); >>> c.array_method(array('d', [1., 2., 3., 4.]), 4); 1 2 3 4; >>> c.m_data[4] # static size is 4, so out of bounds; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>; IndexError: buffer index out of range; >>>. Arrays of arrays are supported through the C++ low-level view objects.; This only works well if sizes are known at compile time or can be inferred.; If sizes are not known, the size is set to a large integer (depending on the; array element size) to allow access.; It is then up to the developer not to access the array out-of-bounds.; There is limited support for arrays of instances, but those should be avo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/basic_types.rst:3237,interface,interface,3237,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/basic_types.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/basic_types.rst,2,['interface'],['interface']

It is based on the new class `TSimpleAnalysis`.; * Do not automatically setup read cache during `TTree::Fill()`. This fixes [ROOT-8031].; * Make sure the option ""PARA"" in `TTree::Draw` is used with at least tow variables [ROOT-8196].; * The with `goff` option one can use as many variables as needed.

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`.

Integrability," defaults to lowering such barriers to normal loads; and stores unless you arrange otherwise. Implementing a collector plugin; -------------------------------. User code specifies which GC code generation to use with the ``gc`` function; attribute or, equivalently, with the ``setGC`` method of ``Function``. To implement a GC plugin, it is necessary to subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy``,; which can be accomplished in a few lines of boilerplate code. LLVM's; infrastructure provides access to several important algorithms. For an; uncontroversial collector, all that remains may be to compile LLVM's computed; stack map to assembly code (using the binary representation expected by the; runtime library). This can be accomplished in about 100 lines of code. This is not the appropriate place to implement a garbage collected heap or a; garbage collector itself. That code should exist in the language's runtime; library. The compiler plugin is responsible for generating code which conforms; to the binary interface defined by library, most essentially the :ref:`stack map; <stack-map>`. To subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy`` and register it with the compiler:. .. code-block:: c++. // lib/MyGC/MyGC.cpp - Example LLVM GC plugin. #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCStrategy.h""; #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCMetadata.h""; #include ""llvm/Support/Compiler.h"". using namespace llvm;. namespace {; class LLVM_LIBRARY_VISIBILITY MyGC : public GCStrategy {; public:; MyGC() {}; };.

More specifically:. * ``llvm.gcread`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``load``; instruction. * ``llvm.gcwrite`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``store``; instruction. * No safe points are added to the code. * The stack map is not compiled into the executable.

Best Practices for Configuring a Fast Builder; =============================================. As mentioned above, we generally have a strong preference for; builders which can build every commit as they come in. This section; includes best practices and some recommendations as to how to achieve; that end. The goal; In 2020, the monorepo had just under 35 thousand commits. This works; out to an average of 4 commits per hour. Already, we can see that a; builder must cycle in less than 15 minutes to have a hope of being; useful. However, those commits are not uniformly distributed. They; tend to cluster strongly during US working hours. Looking at a couple; of recent (Nov 2021) working days, we routinely see ~10 commits per; hour during peek times, with occasional spikes as high as ~15 commits; per hour. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we should plan for our builder to; complete ~10-15 builds an hour. Resource Appropriately; At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every; 4 to 6 minutes. For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs,; this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine. In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration. For some rough back of the envelope; numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will need something; on the order of 5-8 workers. If your build config takes ~2 hours, you'll; need something on the order of 20-30 workers. The rest of this section; focuses on how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can.

Optionally, the dictionary generation process also produces a mapping file,; which lists the libraries needed to load C++ classes on request (for details,; see the section on the class loader below). Structurally, you could have a single dictionary for a project as a whole,; but more likely a large project will have a pre-existing functional; decomposition that can be followed, with a dictionary per functional unit.

There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``).

Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not. If we let the compiler insert the appropriate ``smstart``; and ``smstop`` instructions around call boundaries, then the effects on SVE; state can be mitigated. By limiting the state changes to a very brief window; around the call we can control how the operations are scheduled and how live; values remain preserved between state transitions. In order to control PSTATE.SM at this level of granularity, we use function and; callsite attributes rather than intrinsics. Restrictions on attributes; --------------------------. * It is undefined behaviour to pass or return (pointers to) scalable vector; objects to/from functions which may use a different SVE vector length.; This includes functions with a non-streaming interface, but marked with; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` and ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_preserved``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_shared``. These restrictions also apply in the higher level SME ACLE, which means we can; emit diagnostics in Clang to signal users about incorrect behaviour.

Integrability," dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime. There are also uncommon enough to make it; reasonable to require the precise-lifetime annotation if someone; really wants to rely on them. Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the chance to operate on the value, e.g. to retain it, before; ARC releases the original pointer.

Then we call; **`TSocket`**`::Send` to send the message with the histogram. ``` {.cpp}; ...; // create an object to be sent; TH1F *hpx = new TH1F(""hpx"",""px distribution"",100,-4,4);; hpx->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);. // create a TMessage to send the object; TMessage message(kMESS_OBJECT);. // write the histogram into the message buffer; message.WriteObject(hpx);. // send the message; socket->Send(message);; ...; ```. On the receiving end (in our case the server side), we write a while; loop to wait and receive a message with a histogram. Once we have a; message, we call `TMessage::ReadObject`, which returns a pointer to; **`TObject`**. We have to cast it to a **`TH1`** pointer, and now we; have a histogram. At the end of the loop, the message is deleted, and; another one is created at the beginning. ``` {.cpp}; while (1) {; TMessage *message;; socket->Recv(message);; TH1 *h = (TH1*)message->ReadObject(message->GetClass());; delete message;; }; ```. ## Closing the Connection. Once we are done sending objects, we close the connection by closing the; sockets at both ends. ``` {.cpp}; Socket->Close();; ```.

The later use is used by; ``_Pragma`` and will most likely be used to handle unbounded look-ahead for the; C++ parser. .. _MultipleIncludeOpt:. The ``MultipleIncludeOpt`` class; --------------------------------. The ``MultipleIncludeOpt`` class implements a really simple little state; machine that is used to detect the standard ""``#ifndef XX`` / ``#define XX``""; idiom that people typically use to prevent multiple inclusion of headers. If a; buffer uses this idiom and is subsequently ``#include``'d, the preprocessor can; simply check to see whether the guarding condition is defined or not. If so,; the preprocessor can completely ignore the include of the header. .. _Parser:. The Parser Library; ==================. This library contains a recursive-descent parser that polls tokens from the; preprocessor and notifies a client of the parsing progress. Historically, the parser used to talk to an abstract ``Action`` interface that; had virtual methods for parse events, for example ``ActOnBinOp()``. When Clang; grew C++ support, the parser stopped supporting general ``Action`` clients --; it now always talks to the :ref:`Sema library <Sema>`. However, the Parser; still accesses AST objects only through opaque types like ``ExprResult`` and; ``StmtResult``. Only :ref:`Sema <Sema>` looks at the AST node contents of these; wrappers. .. _AST:. The AST Library; ===============. .. _ASTPhilosophy:. Design philosophy; -----------------. Immutability; ^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Integrability," exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These; headers and the things they declare are considered to be platform agnostic.; LLVM source files may include them or obtain their inclusion through; ``lib/Support`` interfaces. High Level Interface; --------------------. The entry points specified in the interface of ``lib/Support`` must be aimed at; completing some reasonably high level task needed by LLVM. We do not want to; simply wrap each operating system call. It would be preferable to wrap several; operating system calls that are always used in conjunction with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and ``wait``. The; correct thing for ``lib/Support`` to provide is a function, say; ``ExecuteProgramAndWait``, that implements the functionality completely. what; we don't want is wrappers for the operating system calls involved. There must **not** be a one-to-one relationship between operating system; calls and the Support library's interface. Any such interface function will be; suspicious. No Unused Functionality; -----------------------. There must be no functionality specified in the interface of ``lib/Support``; that isn't actually used by LLVM. We're not writing a general purpose operating; system wrapper here, just enough to satisfy LLVM's needs. And, LLVM doesn't; need much. This design goal aims to keep the ``lib/Support`` interface small and; understandable which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:4654,wrap,wrappers,4654,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrappers']

Integrability," features to declare a property and; to let compiler synthesize accessor methods. The debugger lets developer inspect Objective C interfaces and their instance; variables and class variables. However, the debugger does not know anything; about the properties defined in Objective C interfaces. The debugger consumes; information generated by compiler in DWARF format. The format does not support; encoding of Objective C properties. This proposal describes DWARF extensions to; encode Objective C properties, which the debugger can use to let developers; inspect Objective C properties. Proposal; ^^^^^^^^. Objective C properties exist separately from class members. A property can be; defined only by ""setter"" and ""getter"" selectors, and be calculated anew on each; access. Or a property can just be a direct access to some declared ivar.; Finally it can have an ivar ""automatically synthesized"" for it by the compiler,; in which case the property can be referred to in user code directly using the; standard C dereference syntax as well as through the property ""dot"" syntax, but; there is no entry in the ``@interface`` declaration corresponding to this ivar. To facilitate debugging, these properties we will add a new DWARF TAG into the; ``DW_TAG_structure_type`` definition for the class to hold the description of a; given property, and a set of DWARF attributes that provide said description.; The property tag will also contain the name and declared type of the property. If there is a related ivar, there will also be a DWARF property attribute placed; in the ``DW_TAG_member`` DIE for that ivar referring back to the property TAG; for that property. And in the case where the compiler synthesizes the ivar; directly, the compiler is expected to generate a ``DW_TAG_member`` for that; ivar (with the ``DW_AT_artificial`` set to 1), whose name will be the name used; to access this ivar directly in code, and with the property attribute pointing; back to the property it is backing.

One library (both; its headers and implementation) should only use things from the libraries; listed in its dependencies. Some of this constraint can be enforced by classic Unix linkers (Mac & Windows; linkers, as well as lld, do not enforce this constraint). A Unix linker; searches left to right through the libraries specified on its command line and; never revisits a library. In this way, no circular dependencies between; libraries can exist. This doesn't fully enforce all inter-library dependencies, and importantly; doesn't enforce header file circular dependencies created by inline functions.; A good way to answer the ""is this layered correctly"" would be to consider; whether a Unix linker would succeed at linking the program if all inline; functions were defined out-of-line. (& for all valid orderings of dependencies; - since linking resolution is linear, it's possible that some implicit; dependencies can sneak through: A depends on B and C, so valid orderings are; ""C B A"" or ""B C A"", in both cases the explicit dependencies come before their; use.

Integrability," following unordered collections are available:. - **`THashTable`**. - **`TMap`**. ## Iterators: Processing a Collection. The concept of processing all the members of a collection is generic,; i.e. independent of any specific representation of a collection. To; process each object in a collection one needs some type of cursor that; is initialized and then steps over each member of the collection in; turn. Collection objects could provide this service but there is a snag:; as there is only one collection object per collection there would only; be one cursor. Instead, to permit the use of as many cursors as; required, they are made separate classes called iterator. For each; collection class there is an associated iterator class that knows how to; sequentially retrieve each member in turn. The relationship between a; collection and its iterator is very close and may require that the; iterator has full access to the collection (i.e. it is a friend class).; In general iterator will be used via the **`TIter`** wrapper class. For; example:. - **`TList`** **`TListIter`**. - **`TMap`** **`TMapIter`**. ## Foundation Classes. All collections are based on the fundamental classes: **`TCollection`**; and **`TIterator`**. They are so generic that it is not possible to; create objects from them; they are only used as base classes for other; classes (i.e. they are abstract base classes).

In this case, the ``basic-aa`` pass will disambiguate the stores to ``C[0]`` and; ``C[1]`` because they are accesses to two distinct locations one byte apart, and; the accesses are each one byte.

The ``alias`` method is the primary interface used to determine whether or not; two memory objects alias each other. It takes two memory objects as input and; returns MustAlias, PartialAlias, MayAlias, or NoAlias as appropriate. Like all ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces, the ``alias`` method requires that either; the two pointer values be defined within the same function, or at least one of; the values is a :ref:`constant <constants>`. .. _Must, May, or No:. Must, May, and No Alias Responses; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``NoAlias`` response may be used when there is never an immediate dependence; between any memory reference *based* on one pointer and any memory reference; *based* the other. The most obvious example is when the two pointers point to; non-overlapping memory ranges. Another is when the two pointers are only ever; used for reading memory. Another is when the memory is freed and reallocated; between accesses through one pointer and accesses through the other --- in this; case, there is a dependence, but it's mediated by th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst:4316,interface,interface,4316,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

Improve the algorithm to compute the lower limit of an axis in log scale when its; real lower limit is 0. The problem was reported in ROOT-7414. Using the `COL` option with histograms having some negative bins; the empty bins; (containing 0) are drawn. In some cases one wants to not draw empty bins; (containing 0) of histograms having a negative minimum. The option `1`, used with; the option `COL`, allows to do that. Implement the Log option for `CANDLE` plots as requested; [here](https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20225&p=87006#p87006). ### TTeXDump. From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues for the proper line wrapping (this is the one implemented in; this change). ### TLatex.

Integrability," for all threads in ``S``. Divergent Cycle Exits; ---------------------. When a divergent branch occurs inside a cycle, it is possible that a; diverged path continues to an exit of the cycle. This is called a; divergent cycle exit. If the cycle is irreducible, the diverged path; may re-enter and eventually reach a join within the cycle. Such a join; should be examined for the :ref:`diverged entry; <convergence-diverged-entry>` criterion. Nodes along the diverged path that lie outside the cycle experience; *temporal divergence*, when two threads executing convergently inside; the cycle produce uniform values, but exit the cycle along the same; divergent path after executing the header a different number of times; (informally, on different iterations of the cycle). For a node ``N``; inside the cycle the outputs may be uniform for the two threads, but; any use ``U`` outside the cycle receives a value from non-converged; dynamic instances of ``N``. An output of ``U`` may be divergent,; depending on the semantics of the instruction. .. _uniformity-analysis:. Static Uniformity Analysis; ==========================. Irreducible control flow results in different cycle hierarchies; depending on the choice of headers during depth-first traversal. As a; result, a static analysis cannot always determine the convergence of; nodes in irreducible cycles, and any uniformity analysis is limited to; those static instances whose convergence is independent of the cycle; hierarchy:. .. _convergence-m-converged:. **m-converged static instances:**. A static instance ``X`` is *m-converged* for a given CFG if and only; if the maximal converged-with relation for its dynamic instances is; the same in every cycle hierarchy that can be constructed for that CFG. .. note::. In other words, two dynamic instances ``X1`` and ``X2`` of an; m-converged static instance ``X`` are converged in some cycle; hierarchy if and only if they are also converged in every other; cycle hierarchy for the same CFG.

When starting the server, the following arguments should be specified:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name"");; ```. After that, the web browser will automatically request to input a name/password for the domain ""domain_name"".

For instance, one could hide complete folder from 'guest' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""hidden=guest"");; ```. Or one could hide from all but 'admin' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""visible=admin"");; ```. Hidden folders or objects can not be accessed via http protocol. By default server runs in readonly mode and do not allow methods execution via 'exe.json' or 'exe.bin' requests. To allow such action, one could either grant generic access for all or one could allow to execute only special method:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow=all"");; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow_method=GetTitle"");; ```.

ROOT is an object-oriented framework aimed at solving the data; analysis challenges of high-energy physics. There are two key words in; this definition, object oriented and framework. First, we explain what; we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented; framework. ### What Is a Framework?. Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city.; Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services; provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the; services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones.; The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching; system, are transparent to you as the user. You do not care; you are; only interested in using the phone to communicate with your; collaborators to solve your domain specific problems. Programming outside of a framework may be compared to living in the; country. In order to have transportation and water, you will have to; build a road and dig a well. To have services like telephone and; electricity you will need to route the wires to your home. In; addition, you cannot build some things yourself. For example, you; cannot build a commercial airport on your patch of land. From a global; perspective, it would make no sense for everyone to build their; own airport. You see you will be very busy building the infrastructure; (or framework) before you can use the phone to communicate with your; collaborators and have a drink of water at the same time.

When enabled, this; pragma allows the expression ``x / y`` to be approximated as ``x *; (1.0 / y)``. This pragma can be used to disable reciprocal; approximation when it is otherwise enabled for the translation unit; with the ``-freciprocal-math`` flag or other fast-math options. The; pragma can take two values: ``on`` and ``off``. .. code-block:: c++. float f(float x, float y); {; // Enable floating point reciprocal approximation; #pragma clang fp reciprocal(on); return x / y;; }. ``#pragma clang fp contract`` specifies whether the compiler should; contract a multiply and an addition (or subtraction) into a fused FMA; operation when supported by the target. The pragma can take three values: ``on``, ``fast`` and ``off``. The ``on``; option is identical to using ``#pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT(ON)`` and it allows; fusion as specified the language standard.

A set of miscellaneous elementary mathematical functions is provided along with a set of basic trigonometrical functions. Some of this functions refer to basic mathematical functions like the square root, the power to a number of the calculus of a logarithm, while others are used for number treatment, like rounding. Although there are some functions that are not in the standard C math library (like `Factorial`), most of the functionality offered here is just a wrapper of the first ones. Nevertheless, some of the them also offer some security checks or a better precision, like the trigonometrical functions `ASin(x)`, `ACos(x)` or `ATan(x)`. ```{.cpp}; // Generate a vector with 10 random numbers; vector<double> v(10);; std::generate(v.begin(), v.end(), rand);. // Find the minimum value of the vector (iterator version); vector<double>::iterator it;; it = TMath::LocMin(v.begin(), v.end());; std::cout << *it << std::endl;. // The same with the old-style version; int i;; i = TMath::LocMin(10, &v[0]);; std::cout << v[i] << std::endl;; ```.

There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------. Any functions defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``); must not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header; file for that function is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------.

Integrability," function `operator()` is; defined for the **`TIter`** class to be equivalent to the `Next()`; method. ## The TList Collection. A **`TList`** is a doubly linked list. Before being inserted into the; list the object pointer is wrapped in a **`TObjLink`** object that; contains, besides the object pointer also a previous and next pointer. Objects are typically added using:. - `Add()`. - `AddFirst(), AddLast()`. - `AddBefore(), AddAfter()`. **Main features of`TList`**: very low cost of adding/removing elements; anywhere in the list. **Overhead per element**: 1 `TObjLink`, i.e. two 4 (or 8) byte pointers; + pointer to `vtable` = 12 (or 24) bytes. Next figure shows the internal data structure of a **`TList`**. ![The internal data structure of a TList](pictures/020001A6.jpg). ### Iterating Over a TList. There are four ways to iterate over a **`TList`**:. - Using the `ForEach` script:. ``` {.cpp}; GetListOfPrimitives()->ForEach(TObject,Draw)();; ```. - Using the **`TList`** iterator **`TListIter`** (via the wrapper; class **`TIter`**):. ``` {.cpp}; TIter next(GetListOfTracks());; while ((TTrack *obj = (TTrack *)next())); obj->Draw();; ```. - Using the **`TObjLink`** list entries (that wrap the; **`TObject`**\*):. ``` {.cpp}; TObjLink *lnk = GetListOfPrimitives()->FirstLink();; while (lnk) {; lnk->GetObject()->Draw();; lnk = lnk->Next();; }; ```. - Using the **`TList`**'s `After()` and `Before()` member functions:. ``` {.cpp}; TFree *idcur = this;; while (idcur) {; ...; idcur = (TFree*)GetListOfFree()->After(idcur);; }; ```. Method 1 uses internally method 2. Method 2 works for all collection classes. **`TIter`** overloads; `operator()`. Methods 3 and 4 are specific for **`TList`**. Methods 2, 3 and 4 can also easily iterate backwards using either a; backward **`TIter`** (using argument `kIterBackward`) or by using; `LastLink()` and `lnk>Prev`() or by using the `Before()` method. ## The TObjArray Collection.

The `ROOT::Math::GradFunctor1D` class is used to wrap one-dimensional gradient functions. It can be constructed in three different ways:; * Any object implementing both `double operator()( double)` for the function evaluation and `double Derivative(double)` for the function derivative.; * Any object implementing any member function like `Foo::XXX(double )` for the function evaluation and any other member function like `Foo::YYY(double )` for the derivative.; * Any two function objects implementing `double operator()( double )` . One object provides the function evaluation, the other the derivative. One or both function object can be a free C function of; type `double ()(double )`. #### Wrapping Multi-dimensional Functions. The class `ROOT::Math::Functor` is used to wrap in a very simple and convenient way multi-dimensional function objects. It can wrap all the following types:; * Any C++ callable object implementing `double operator()( const double * )`.; * A free C function of type `double ()(const double * )`.; * A member func",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:44131,wrap,wrap,44131,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['wrap'],['wrap']

The emit method; applies our transform to each module that it is called on and, if the transform; succeeds, passes the transformed module to the base layer. If the transform; fails, our emit function calls; ``MaterializationResponsibility::failMaterialization`` (this JIT clients who; may be waiting on other threads know that the code they were waiting for has; failed to compile) and logs the error with the execution session before bailing; out. The other half of the IRLayer interface we inherit unmodified from the IRLayer; class:. .. code-block:: c++. Error IRLayer::add(JITDylib &JD, ThreadSafeModule TSM, VModuleKey K) {; return JD.define(std::make_unique<BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit>(; *this, std::move(K), std::move(TSM)));; }. This code, from ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Layer.cpp``, adds a; ThreadSafeModule to a given JITDylib by wrapping it up in a; ``MaterializationUnit`` (in this case a ``BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit``).; Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method. These two operations, ``add`` and ``emit``, together constitute the layer; concept: A layer is a way to wrap a part of a compiler pipeline (in this case; the ""opt"" phase of an LLVM compiler) whose API is opaque to ORC with an; interface that ORC can call as needed. The add method takes an; module in some input program representation (in this case an LLVM IR module); and stores it in the target ``JITDylib``, arranging for it to be passed back; to the layer's emit method when any symbol defined by that module is requested.; Each layer can complete its own work by calling the ``emit`` method of its base; layer.

Note that ``enumerate`` has ``zip_equal`` semantics and provides elements; through a 'reference wrapper' proxy, which makes them modifiable when accessed; through structured bindings or the ``value()`` member function. When two or more; ranges are passed, ``enumerate`` requires them to have equal lengths (checked; with an ``assert``). .. _debugging:. Debugging; =========.

GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possible.; - Don't parse arguments more than once.; - Provide a few simple interfaces for efficiently searching arguments. Simple; ------. Finally, the driver was designed to be ""as simple as possible"", given; the other goals.

The :token:`IfBody` of the then and else arms of the ``if`` establish an; inner scope. Any ``defvar`` variables defined in the bodies go out of scope; when the bodies are finished (see `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details).

Basic Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Concretely, an instance of ``CFG`` is a collection of basic blocks. Each basic; block is an instance of ``CFGBlock``, which simply contains an ordered sequence; of ``Stmt*`` (each referring to statements in the AST). The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface. A ``CFG`` object owns the instances of ``CFGBlock`` within the control-flow; graph it represents. Each ``CFGBlock`` within a CFG is also uniquely numbered; (accessible via ``CFGBlock::getBlockID()``). Currently the number is based on; the ordering the blocks were created, but no assumptions should be made on how; ``CFGBlocks`` are numbered other than their numbers are unique and that they; are numbered from 0..N-1 (where N is the number of basic blocks in the CFG). Entry and Exit Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Each instance of ``CFG`` contains two special blocks: an *entry* block; (accessible via ``CFG::getEntry()``), which has no incoming edges, and an; *exit* block (accessible via ``CFG::getExit()``), which has no outgoing edges.; Neither block contains any statements, and they serve the role of providing a; clear entrance and exit for a body of code such as a function body. The; presence of these empty blocks greatly simplifies t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:112989,interface,interface,112989,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability," had; been signaled before). - `MyCondition.TimedWait(secs,nanosecs)` waits for `MyCondition` until; the *absolute* time in seconds and nanoseconds since beginning of; the epoch (January, 1st, 1970) is reached; to use relative timeouts; ‘‘delta'', it is required to calculate the absolute time at the; beginning of waiting ‘‘now''; for example:. ``` {.cpp}; Ulong_t now,then,delta; // seconds; TDatime myTime; // root daytime class; myTime.Set(); // myTime set to ""now""; now=myTime.Convert(); // to seconds since 1970; ```. - Return value wait of `MyCondition.TimedWait` should be 0, if; `MyCondition.Signal()` was received, and should be nonzero, if; timeout was reached. The conditions example shows how three threaded functions are; synchronized using **`TCondition`**: a ROOT script `condstart.C` starts; the threads, which are defined in a shared library; (`conditions.cxx, conditions.h`). #### Xlib Connections. Usually `Xlib` is not thread safe. This means that calls to the X could; fail, when it receives X-messages from different threads. The actual; result depends strongly on which version of `Xlib` has been installed on; your system. The only thing we can do here within ROOT is calling a; special function `XInitThreads() `(which is part of the `Xlib`), which; should (!) prepare the `Xlib` for the usage with threads. To avoid further problems within ROOT some redefinition of the; ***`gPad`*** pointer was done (that's the main reason for the; recompilation). When a thread creates a **`TCanvas`**, this object is; actually created in the main thread; this should be transparent to the; user. Actions on the canvas are controlled via a function, which returns; a pointer to either thread specific data (TSD) or the main thread; pointer. This mechanism works currently only for ***`gPad`***,; ***`gDirectory`***, ***`gFile`*** and will be implemented soon for other; global Objects as e.g. ***`gVirtualX`***. #### Canceling a TThread.

Integrability," having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt. Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first.

Now it is also possible to specify that p.d.f.s; should be sampled and cached in one or more parameter dimensions; in addition to the automatically determined set of observables.; as well. Also a complete new line of classes with similar functionality has been added inheriting from RooAbsReal.; These are RooAbsCachedReal,RooAbsSelfCachedReal and RooCachedReal. A newly; added class RooHistFunc presents these shapes and is capable of handling negative entries. New PDF error handling structure. New infrastructure has been put into place to propagate and process p.d.f evaluation errors during fitting.; Previously evaluation errors were marked with a zero p.d.f value and propagated as a special condition; in RooAddPdf, RooProdPdf etc to result in a zero top-level p.d.f value that was caught by the RooFit minuit; interface as a special condition. Summary information on the value of the parameters and the observables; was printed for the first 10 occurrences of such conditions. . Now, each p.d.f component that generates an error; in its evaluation logs the error into a separate facility during fitting and the RooFit minuit interface; polls this error logging facility for problems. This allows much more detailed and accurate warning messages; during the minimization phase. The level of verbosity of this new error facility can be controlled with; a new .
