Deployability," to construct my custom BC inheriting from one of the existing ones.

For example, the inlet BC of the SA turbulence model is defined in CTurbSASolver::BC_Inlet(); We can place this definition in a separate file bcinit.cpp and dynamically link this file so you have a libbcinit.so file. SU2 knows about libbcinit.so and BC_Inlet() at compile time. ; In your testcases directory, you can put a copy of bcinit.cpp and redefine the boundary condition BC_Inlet. If you change the boundary condition, you only compile bcinit.cpp in your testcase directory and create a libbcinit.so in your testcase directory. You then make sure that when SU2 is looking for dynamically linked libraries, it searches your testcase directory before it searches the SU2 installation directory. . As you see, this can be used for redefining existing (at compile time) functions and modifying its content. I find it especially useful for creating custom initial conditions. If you want to create a completely new custom boundary condition BC_Custom(), it is probably easiest to predefine this structure and create a custom_bc option in the config file. In a CFD problem, there are only a limited number of possibilities (for types of boundary conditions, and systems of equations), so I'm not sure when a BC_Custom() is useful, or when the tipping point is where self-registering classes will become useful for its implementation. Recompiling the code completely takes maybe 2 minutes for me, so I never saw compiling times as a problem. However, this concept could reduce code duplication and improve readability and maintainability, so I'm curious to see the progress on this...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1058#issuecomment-680758665:1236,install,installation,1236,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1058#issuecomment-680758665,1,['install'],['installation']

We could also parallelize the matrix updates without colouring by setting only the off-diagonal coefficients and then setting the diagonal entries to the column sum.; It turns out that this is worse (by about 10%), maybe if the matrix were symmetric (row sum) but a column sum accesse",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:3830,update,updateBlocks,3830,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,2,['update'],['updateBlocks']

Deployability," viscousTerms(...) const {...}; };; ```; Here note that this class template is derived from CNumericsSIMD but it does not implement `ComputeFlux`, thus it cannot be instantiated by itself. The idea is that convective schemes can use these viscous fluxes as base class (thereby linking them to CNumericsSIMD) to access the `viscousTerms` method (when we don't want viscous terms we just use a dummy viscous class).; Note also the template parameter `nDim`, this is because we want to create specific versions of the numerical schemes for 2D and 3D (we ""want"" this because it allows static allocation and unrolling loops perfectly). Then convective classes also need to be class templates so that we can programatically change their base class:; ```c++; template<class Base>; class MyConvectiveScheme : public Base {; public:; void ComputeFlux(...) const {; // do my own thing; Base::viscousTerms(...);; // update the linear system with the result; }; };; ```; Now to create an instance of this class template we do for example:; ```c++; auto obj = new MyConvectiveScheme< CCompressibleViscousFlux<2> >(...);; ```; which would create an object for 2D problems with viscous terms. And so we need at least 4 instantiations of these class templates, 2D/3D with or without viscous terms, and this is done in the factory method implemented in CNumericsSIMD.cpp, which is the only cpp in this entire implementation. ### Static polymorphism; Another concept used in this implementation for efficiency is static polymorphism.; For example in the non vectorized numerics we have a family of Roe schemes since a lot of code is shared, and the only difference is how the dissipation terms are computed. There this is done with virtual functions, here we want none of that.; Virtual functions allow a parent class to dynamically call methods of its children, we want to do this statically and so we need to let the parent class know who is deriving from it.; ```c++; template<class Derived>; class Parent {; public",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022#issuecomment-699618721:1694,update,update,1694,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022#issuecomment-699618721,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability," with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think.

Deployability,"# Describe the bug. **Issue**; The memory usage of SU2_CFD continuously grows over time and is most noticeable when writing out files at high frequency. This caught my attention when cluster jobs with higher output frequency were consistently exceeding memory limits after a certain amount of time, leading to the job being killed. The same configuration with a lower output frequency can run significantly more iterations without exceeding limits. I may be missing something, but it seems like there is a potential memory leak dependent on the output frequency, which I've documented in this report. **Expected**; Memory usage remains steady over time and does not significantly change with output frequency. **Local tests**; I was able to reproduce the issue locally on a workstation using the [Unsteady NACA0012 Tutorial case](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/compressible_flow/Unsteady_NACA0012), whereby all 2200 time iterations are performed by setting `WINDOW_CAUCHY_CRIT = NO`.

Further editing the config file to run as a steady state simulation with `INNER_ITER= 20000` iterations produces similar results:. ![steady_naca0012_memory_usage_by_output_freq_v711_20210413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82448366/114564622-c4fb3600-9c70-11eb-873d-f9e0696c6484.png). **Serial case**; This issue was not reproducible in serial and exhibits expected behavior:. ![serial_steady_state_naca0012_memory_usage_20210413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82448366/114564602-bf9deb80-9c70-11eb-89dd-88d1e240ce79.png). # To Reproduce.

Deployability,"# Patching CVE-2007-4559. Hi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).

Therefore, the polytropic Peng-Robinson class now allows for inheritance. - New test case (TestCases/nicfd/edge_NPPR) to compare the results of the NPPR with a constant CP model (CP = n0) and the polytropic Peng-Robinson models.

Current situation: The translation velocities and rotation rates of a moving frame (activated with GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME) can only be set in the config file using parameters TRANSLATION_RATE and ROTATION_RATE. During a trim analysis of a free-flying aircraft, these parameters are modified until an equilibrium is achieved. Problem: A change of these parameters requires a new initialization of the solver, which can be time-consuming depending on the mesh size. Proposed solution: A python interface is implemented that allows to change the parameters on-the-fly. The grid velocities are updated before a new iteration. . ## Related Work; This is an extension to pull request #1621. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

This way it is no longer necessary to extract the needed sources for building the executables by hand in the meson.build files of each subdirectory.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. The draft pull request has changes to fix couple of issues in the incompressible solver for rotating frame and convergence rate of unsteady problems (both with and without grid movement).; ; For the rotating frame, there was a confusion between conservative and primitive variables being used for the numerics. For the convergence rate of unsteady problems, the Jacobian contributions in the dual time residual calculations had been altered to include the preconditioner. However, this slows down the convergence from only an order of 100 iterations needed for converged solution per time step to the order of 1000 iterations. Therefore this has been reverted to regain the previous faster convergence rate and further work is necessary to understand the reason for this change. ## Related Work; PR #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. The proposed solver is a treatment of the discrete adjoint sensitivities based on the idea of Sobolev gradient smoothing. . Sobolev smoothing of gradients computes a reinterpretation of the gradient in a different Hilbert space, [see this short overview.](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~renka/papers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. This PR enforces the continuity of velocity explicitly at the fluid structure interface for each time step. The velocity was previously recalculated for the fluid nodes based on displacement history of the nodes. This is still needed for fluid only problems with deforming meshes. However, for FSI problems, the velocity at the interface can be transferred from the structural solution and propagated to the fluid nodes similarly to the displacement which ensures exact agreement at the interface at each time-step. This change has been validated using a typical FSI benchmark of square cylinder with a flexible cantilever beam, which gives good agreement in peak tip displacement and Strouhal number.; . ## Related Work. ## PR Checklist. - [x] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [x] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [x] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [ ] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174:1168,update,updated,1168,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174,1,['update'],['updated']

Commented lines and everything after the `\` are skipped.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. This is a draft PR to discuss and document a much needed overhaul of the shape optimization features in SU2. There have been significant improvements to the main code base (for example, python wrapper integration, the new output structure, new mesh solver etc.) which haven't been leveraged by the shape optimization structure of SU2. . The main idea behind this overhaul is to move as much of the functionality of the current shape optimization framework to python. This creates a more user-friendly and robust interface for defining design variables and constraints. Its easy to make that claim, but let me elucidate it with an example:. > Suppose I am trying to optimize a wing for a given flight condition but I want more design freedom than altering the airfoil shapes along the wing using FFDs. I want to be able to control wing span, taper ratio, dihedral angle, twist, and any number of other geometrical representations of the wing. Currently, I would have to create a new Design Variable (DV) for most of those variables. If anyone has tried this, they know it is a tedious task with having to make alterations in various parts of the code.; >; > But all of these design variables can be represented by aggregations of FFD point movements. The span of the wing can be controlled by constraining the movement of FFD points in the y-direction to be proportional to their y coordinate. The current twist variable does a similar aggregation, at each twist location it rotates the corresponding 4 FFD points by the given angle. ; >; >These design variables could be represented by simple python functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. . Moving functionality to python could also remove the need for some of the other SU2 modules that haven't ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922:222,integrat,integration,222,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Using absolute cauchy convergence is more robust in this case. At the same time, I understand that a more complex input / more parameters might confuse users. An automatic switch, as propsed in this pull request, is a good compromise.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; *Give a brief overview of your contribution here in a few sentences.*; ; This PR greatly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of the flow solvers by implementing a more sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790:521,update,updates,521,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790,2,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; A draft PR for creating self-registering classes with a factory.; The class (CEulerSolver implemented) that wants to register to a factory (CSolverFactory implemented) should:; - Inherit from DBMember template class (new, only handles automatic-registration).; - Provide a ""GetName()"" member method which returns the registered name as a string.; - Provide a ""CreateMethod()"" member with specific signature. This function should handle the full-creation of the object (For CEulerSolver, it makes a pointer and runs Preprocessing on it). The factory class must provide a Register() method that accepts the to-be registered class's name and a pointer to its creation method with the specific signature mentioned above. These design constraints are all enforced in DBMember but no checks where made for now. Instead of meddling with member functions of CSolverFactory, I chose to create the test solver (EULER) directly in CDriver. ### Results so far; 1. Solver gets instantiated successfully, the solver preprocessing phase passes with no problems; 2. When the program gets to integration preprocessing, it fails with out_of_range exception.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. `vcpkg` is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use `preconfigure.py` anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin`. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile `pySU2ad` with `Nothing known about namespace 'medi'` in `Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57` without `-includeall` SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing `using namespace` declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with `using` or prepending namespace name, `clang-tidy` warns against them and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:; * Build modules:; * `SU2_BUILD_CFD`: `ON|OFF`; * `SU2_BUILD_DEF`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_DOT`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_GEO`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_MSH`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_PY_WRAPPER`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_SOL`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * Enable modules:; * `SU2_ENABLE_CGNS`: ; * `SU2_CGNS_CPPFLAGS`: flags to pas",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814:816,install,installation,816,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814,1,['install'],['installation']

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; As proposed in #685, this introduces the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) and ninja build system to eventually replace autotools and make. A [lot of bigger projects](https://mesonbuild.com/Users.html) already use that system (e.g. GNOME, systemd ...) or are transitioning. Compared to autotools and make, building the code should be faster, especially if you build with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Compute Green-Gauss gradients and limiters via a point-loop (like we do for Least Squares), in the limit this allows one thread per point of parallelization. Parallel regions are started inside the functions and again only the master thread calls MPI routines. Move these routines out of CSolver and make them general to reduce code duplication (compressible/incompressible, solution/primitives), and to improve test-ability (if key areas of the code depend less on large objects we can more easily treat them as units). Introduce a way to create different limiters by defining small details like the limiter function (and its associated constants), or any geometry-based modification. I don't seem to have ""hard"" failures in the regressions but I need to run tests, especially for periodic cases as I had to change the ""communication model"" for the min / max computed for limiters.; I will start documenting anyway. ## Related Work; #789 #824 ; Depends on #830. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/834:1367,update,updated,1367,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/834,1,['update'],['updated']

This PR puts two additional strategies in place for the discrete adjoint that help with obtaining a coloring before resorting to reductions, making successful coloring more likely. 1. If the requested edge color group size does not produce an efficient coloring, the maximum edge color group size that still produces an efficient coloring is chosen instead.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. The general idea for this PR can be cited from @pcarruscag in #1226:; ```; The ideia would be to create a CFVMSolverBase (in the style of the one for flow solvers) to cover:. Turbulence solvers;; Heat solver;; Radiation solver;; General passive/active scalar solvers;; Eventual transition solvers;. The starting point would be the current base turbulence solver.; ```; ; Right now the only things I did were (i.e. don't fear the large diff); - create CScalarSolver/Variable files/classes and scalar_convection/diffusion/sources files and fill them with the contents of the CTurb* or turb_* files.; - Make CScalarSolver/Variable the parent class of CTurbSolver/Variable; - Delete pretty much everything from CTurb* or turb_* files except for some constructors. So far it compiled and some local regression testing showed no problems, lets see what the CI pipeline has to say about this. Now with this additional class introduced the actual works begins:; - figure out what is a reasonable interface in CScalar* to unify transported species and turb-models (and the other solvers probably); - code this common interface and push all turb-specific things back into the respective files (that is why I didn't `git mv` ). In order to keep this somewhat limited I would focus on porting the Turbsolvers to the new structure (however that might look, but looking at #1223 is what I'll do first) and maybe a simple transported passive scalar or so. We want the turb solver to be integrated under that Scalar-class which is arguably what most/all people use, that's why I want to have in this work at the beginning. We also have quite a few RANS Testcases so it is directly visible if something in the actual computation is changed.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. This PR implements a passive species transport solver. The passive means, that the mass fraction at each location does not influence any fluid-properties and thereby the mean flow (which reminds me that this is a good sanity check to compare mean flow residuals).

Additionally `species_convection/diffusion/sources` were added just as it is the case for the turbulence solver (both based on the general scalar* framework). Please note that prob ~1000 lines are cfg's, README's, helping scripts. . ## Related Work; Preliminary work was done in #1330 with creating a base class for scalar transport equations. #1223 and #1332 already mostly implement the here shown species solver and big chunks were copied over from there, but they are not based on the new CScalarSolver.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,; there is a little bug in the loading of the primal solution for the DiscAdjFluid Iteration for DualTimeStepping 1st order. ; 1. The solution for timestep n-1 should be loaded instead of n-2 -> I added an if statement there.; 2. solution_old is used as a temporary container for the freshly loaded solution. Then the solution which is currently at solution_time_n is pushed to be the ""main"" solution n+1. Afterwards the solution_old is put in the solution_time_n container -> That last step was wrong such that the loaded solution never gets involved. I used the regression test in disc_adj_rans/cylinder which covers DualTimeStepping 2nd order and reused it for a new Testcase which covers 1st order. ; For now, the .travis.yml has a different su2code/Testcases branch in it such that other are not hindered by this PR when running travis. If this PR is merged with the new Testcase, the TestCases repo has to be updated and the .travis.yml needs to be reverted. ; Let me know if adding a new TestCase is OK. I am aware that not every detail can get its own regression test. . I checked my changes against finite differences for that Testcase. I'll post the result below. Additionally I suppressed the output of .csv files in driver_structure.cpp for unsteady simulations if `WRT_CSV_SOL= NO` is set. .

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi, . A small one: For 1 zone heat equation, the primal restart for the adjoint run was missing the solution reset after the CLEAR_INDICES run. Additionally I added a output_precision to the primal Residual Table for the adjoint. My recommendation is to set OUTPUT_PRECISION= 12 (because that is the fixed field Width of the table) and compare those screen residuals to the history output of the comparing primal simulations. I noticed this problem while looking at non-perfect restarts for CHT cases, which I am currently still debugging. I will make an issue for that soon (Edit #1395 ). Note though that the discrepancies seem subtle and a gradient comparison with FD shows and showed good agreement in the past. ## PR Checklist. - [x] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [x] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [x] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [ ] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1394:1162,update,updated,1162,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1394,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi, I found some problems with the implementation of the SA-NEG and SA-NEG-R models wrt to what is described on TMR. Plus, I found a suggestion on the computation of the SHat variable to avoid clipping for negative values (also reported on TMR).; . ## Related Work; - Implementation of new computation of SHat (Jacobian was computed by hand and is somewhat complex. Probably I could derive a simplified formulation); - Added CRot constant for SA-R model; - Modified computation of var.S for the combination SA-NEG-R; - Slightly change the computation of muT from nu_tilde: now muT = 0 if nu_tilde <0. Before it was muT = max(muT, 0.0), which should not always coincide with nu_tilde > 0.; - Not related to SA: added viscous drag as output in the history file. .

Doesn't matter whether VOLUME_OUTPUT is set with COORDINATES or not at all. I will look into this again but if you have a hint that would be appreciated💐 **Edit:** of course they are written implicitly otherwise on couldn't open a visu file but what do we have the volume output field COORDINATES for then?

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I added new output file formats. First of all support for the VTK XML file format ([see this pdf](https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf)) (file ending *.vtu). This adds support for possible compression, portable binary encoding, random access, big endian and little endian byte order, multiple file representation of piece data. I made this the new default format if `PARAVIEW` has been added to `OUTPUT_FILES`. The old *.vtk format can still be used with `PARAVIEW_LEGACY`. However, the main reason for this new format is that it is required for new Multiblock file (*.vtm) output. This file is a simple XML file which defines a data hierarchy in order to represent individual parts of the domain (which are stored as *.vtu files). With this it is possible to directly select and visualize the solution in individual zones and/or on boundaries. This new format can be enabled with `PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK` as value for `OUTPUT_FILES`. At the moment all boundaries are written, I might add an option to disable/enable some of them (maybe re-using the `MARKER_PLOTTING` option). In order not to cluster the working directory, the individual *.vtu files are placed in subfolders, since they are more or less opaque to the user. . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I discovered that the Aachen regression test was actually on its way to divergence.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I have found it useful to be able to adaptively change deltaT using the Python wrapper -- this PR implements that functionality. Instead of `CDriver::GetUnsteadyTimeStep` returning `CConfig::GetTime_Step`, it was updated to return the actual dimensional timestep used in iterations. A new `CDriver::SetUnsteadyTimeStep` function was implemented that updates both `Delta_UnstTimeND` and `Delta_UnstTime` in `CConfig`. A new setter function for `Delta_UnstTime` had to be implemented to do this as well. A quick grep showed me that the only usage of `CConfig::GetTime_Step` appears to be in SU2_SOL, initialization, and outputting in the NonDimTable. However, I did see one usage of it here, which appears to be called every iteration:. https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/2c9fbb6cfc0f9dfbb4a1f6afb9cf5004c33b1c25/SU2_CFD/src/integration/CFEM_DG_Integration.cpp#L75. I can update that line if necessary to instead call `CConfig::GetDelta_UnstTime`.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I would like to be able to calculate a gust encounter of a free-flying, elastic aircraft. The rigid body reaction (in terms of velocities u, v, w and rotation rates p, q, r) as well as the elastic structural dynamic reaction (displacement of all surface nodes of the CFD mesh) are calculated by our own aeroelastic solver, coupled via the python interface, while SU2 shall provide the aerodynamic side, as a higher fidelity alternative to panel methods such as VLM & DLM. . Update, 13.04.2023: The combination of grid velocities from the moving + deforming grid turned out to be more complicated as expected (at least for me) and the moving grid is not fully implemented for unsteady simulations (according to Pedro, some source terms are missing). The new approach uses a farfield onflow condition at alpha=0.0 and translates and rotates the whole aircraft in the elastic mesh for the rigid body + structural dynamic reaction. This is more laborious on my side (transformation of the surface, the deformation vector and the forces about the Euler angles) but simplifies the work on the SU2 side:. - extend the gust to 3D meshes (current implementation only for 2D meshes); - ~~update the grid movement during the time domain simulation via the python interface; Involved parameters: ; GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME; TRANSLATION_RATE= u v w ; ROTATION_RATE= p q r~~; - update the surface mesh deformation during the time domain simulation via the python interface ; Involved parameters: ; DEFORM_MESH= YES; MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( list of markers ).

Makes the structural objective functions available as screen/history output under the name COMBO. Improves/fixes the incremental load approach when used for multizone problems. ## Related Work; #919 #594. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/933:519,integrat,integration,519,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/933,2,"['integrat', 'update']","['integration', 'updated']"

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a joint collaboration with @rsanfer we discovered that the Prism and Pyramid shape elements used for mesh deformation had some issues, namely:; - The Prism (6 nodes) element had incorrect integration points, and perhaps due to some inconsistency between the ordering of the nodes and the shape function it had ""negative"" stiffness (deform opposite to force). The latter issue was remedied by using negative weights... I tried permuting the integration points but that did not help.; - The Pyramid (5 nodes) had inconsistent integration points and shape functions, it was using pyramid points but degenerate hex functions, this made the element some 20 times more flexible than it should be, pyramid shape functions are used now. My main reason to look into this was to support all element types in the structural solver both for linear and nonlinear analysis, in principle that should be working now, but I still have tests to run. I took the opportunity to refactor the CElement family of classes, now the derived classes only deal with the shape specifics:; - Integration/extrapolation points, shape function and derivatives, are computed and stored at construction.; - Area/Volume computation in undeformed (reference) or deformed (current) coordinates. Generic actions like allocating data and computing gradients are done by the base class. For the latter I included one method for 2D and another for 3D, they only differ in the inversion of the Jacobian but being specialized nDim can be ""hardcoded"" which should allow for more compile time optimization. I expect some regressions to fail, and I will still run more tests to verify the revised elements. I will post those results and add a regression. ## PR Checklist. - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consiste",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681:212,integrat,integration,212,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681,3,['integrat'],['integration']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a nutshell, we still solve a linear system to update the solution, but the approximate Jacobian is replaced by matrix-free products with the ""real"" Jacobian which are obtained by finite differences (each product requires the computation of the residual for a perturbed solution).; This linear system is much more ill-conditioned, and so in addition to the classical linear preconditioners, it is possible to use the traditional linear system as the preconditioner (you gotta love the kind of stuff SU2 lets you get away with sometimes).; This nesting makes each iteration potentially very expensive, it is crucial not to ""over solve"" the linear systems, and to use adaptive CFL to run always at the highest CFL possible. Notwithstanding the preconditioner madness, this also works for explicit solvers, but that may only be good enough for dual time methods with relatively small time steps. This seems to be good at converging problems that would otherwise not get past a limit cycle.; I do not expect it to be faster when that is not a problem.

The initial idea was to couple all solvers (flow, turbulence, etc.) but that makes the problem even more ill-conditioned and so I took a step back (as that also makes the implementation simpler...).; The skeleton of the coupled iteration exists in commit c97221b6f7dfd315dfceb9f59f8928790c78e0ce and it was functional... if anyone wants to take it further, it's there. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183:70,update,update,70,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a previous PR the SST model implementation in the CTurbSSTSolver was corrected to use the vorticity magnitude to calculate the turbulent viscosity (mu_T). But this change was not copied in the relevant numerics class where mu_T is used to calculate production terms. This is probably going to break all the SST related regression tests, so I will ensure convergence of those cases and update regression values. ; ; ## Related Work; A relevant discussion to have here is whether to update the SST turbulence model according to a 2003 paper by Menter (author of the SST model): [Ten years of industrial experience with the SST turbulence model](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.2814&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It involves tiny changes to coefficients, production limits, and uses strain magnitude instead of the vorticity magnitude to calculate mu_T. The last point means reversing the change that this PR is making. But currently the model is just inconsistent and needs to be corrected. .

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In order to structure the construction of the solvers a little bit and to remove the dependency of the driver on the solver, I created a static solver factory class. There are routines to create individual instances as well as the whole container. It should be much easier now to see what position in the containers are actually allocated for the different solvers. The `createSolver` routine is a generic one that simply calls `new`. The others have some additional checks or calls for the construction. The idea here was to remove any `if` statements in the `createSolverContainer` routine to ease readability. . If everybody agrees, we could use a similar structure for other classes as well.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In some cases we use relative frame for rotor zone to perform URANS, e.g., in aeroelasticity analysis, we want the grid movement comes only from blade deformation. The problem is that the sliding plane in SU2 works only for absolute frame. In relative frame, the grid is not rotating, so the interpolation at sliding interface is not changed as time step is marching. The proposed changes rotate the sliding interface in accordance with physical time steps to perform interpolation. This function is activated only for relative frame. The grid itself is not rotating.; Currently, this is only implemented in CNearestneighbor class, other interpolation method should be changed as well in the near future. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Multi-passage or full-annulus simulation is very important for turbomachinery case. For example, say one wants to simulate the circumferential features like rotating-stall or inlet distortion effect. Usually one first conducts single-passage RANS computation, then starts multi-passage or even full-annulus URANS from that converged single-passage solution. To do this in SU2, one meets two problems:; 1) Replicate the single-passage grid to user-defined number of passages (including full-annulus); 2) Replicate the single-passage solution. The proposed changes solve the two above mentioned problems.; This function is one of a series of features that enable SU2 to run URANS for turbomachinery cases, which have been shared to the SU2-Turbo group recently. ; This function has been used for my research for almost one year. If necessary, I could add simple test cases as well. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; On a user-specified upstream half-plane, fix the values of turbulence quantities to their far-field values, instead of integrating the turbulence model equations. In the far-field flow, the production terms of SST for K and omega are zero, while destruction still takes place. Thus the turbulence quantities typically decay on their way from the far-field boundary to the airfoil, until they reach the `lowerlimit`. See for instance this turbulence kinetic energy plot on the NACA0012 mesh:; ![kk_sst_copr_TKE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72806890/111277953-4f805380-8639-11eb-8d34-466e612aac4e.png). This has been presented in [1] together with two solution approaches:; - *Sustaining terms*, which are additional source terms compensating the destruction terms in the far-field flow. This approach has been already implemented with the `KIND_TURB_MODEL= SST_SUST` option.; ![kk_sst_copr_sust_TKE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72806890/111278024-60c96000-8639-11eb-8b1b-f4e95a3f97ab.png); - *Floor values*, which is equivalent to set the `lowerlimit` to the far-field values in the upstream region of the airfoil.; This PR adds floor values, but in the form of *fixed values*: The turbulence quantities are just set to the far-field values in the upstream region. This has been implemented in analogy to the strong boundary conditions. The correction can be activated like this:. TURB_FIXED_VALUES= YES; TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN= -1.0. The second parameter specifies the half-plane on which fixed values are applied. This half-plane consists of those points for which the dot product of their coordinate vector with the normalized far-field velocity vector is less than `TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN`. .

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Similar to the quasi-Newton acceleration provided by `CQuasiNewtonInvLeastSquares`, the proposed toolbox class `CNewtonUpdateOnSubspace` performs a correction on adjoint solution updates by keeping track of past iterates. Here, they are used to identify eigenvectors with large eigenvalues which slow down the overall convergence and to form a (small) subspace basis from them. Each fixed-point solution update is then [projected onto that subspace and the projected part will be additionally corrected via a ""real"" Newton step (a.k.a. ""RPM"")](https://doi.org/10.1137/0730057) using the computational graph for precise derivative information. This preliminary result with one basis vector indicates that the procedure can be effective at very low additional cost (for n basis vectors, it mainly reduces to n scalar products of the current fixed-point iterate with the basis vectors, the Newton step is cheap as n is small). The residuals are obtained from a fully coupled adjoint CHT problem (2d heated cylinder in laminar flow) with a heatflux objective function. ![plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22639394/122736716-9ad18000-d280-11eb-9983-c2d47d434dc5.png).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; So I took a common method that folks use to converge multi physics problems expressed as fixed point iterations (the IQN-ILS) and applied it to the inner iterations of the discrete adjoint drivers (single and multizone), it seems to work well...

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The CRot value was set to 1.0 for the HLPW5 but the standard value is 2.0 as suggested in TMR. Plus, there may be some inconsistencies with the negative branch of SA when used with the R variant. $\hat{S}$ should be used in the computation of the production term when $\hat{\nu}>0$. When $\hat{\nu}<0$, instead, the vorticity $\Omega$ should be used together with the $c_{t3}$ constant. Citing TMR:. ""This model is the same as the ""standard"" version (SA), except that the (SA-R) production term becomes: . $c_{b1}(1-f_{t2})[\hat{S}+C_{rot}min(0,S-\Omega)]\hat{\nu}$. ... However, a negative production term is not acceptable for the negative branch ($\hat{\nu} < 0$) of the (SA-neg) model. If coding (SA-neg-R), a possible C0 continuous production term in the negative (SA-neg-R) branch is the following: . $c_{b1}(1-c_{t3})[\hat{\Omega}+C_{rot}min(0,S-\Omega)]\hat{\nu}$. "". I don't understand if the second production term has to be used everytime SA-neg is considered or only at the points where $\hat{\nu}<0$. If it is already taken into account, then I'll modify the PR. ## Related Work. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The hybrid parallel implementation uses grid coloring (edge and element) to avoid race conditions when building the residual vector and Jacobian matrix.; Depending on grid size, type, and ordering, it may be difficult to find a good coloring, i.e. providing locality and enough parallelism (all threads getting almost the same number of work chunks to work on per color). This PR extends the use of the ""reducer strategy"" to fine grids (introduced and described in #861 for coarse grids, which before #894 I thought would be the only problematic scenarios) as a fallback strategy that is automatically selected when the coloring efficiency (highlighted below) drops below a threshold value. The reducer strategy can be forced by setting EDGE_COLORING_GROUP_SIZE to 0 (for some cases it seems to give better performance, contrary to the initial assessment from #789).; For element loops (CFEASolver and CMeshSolver, modified in #843) an automatic fallback was also introduced, but using ""locks"" (explained below) as a ""reducer strategy"" would use too much memory, and element loops are more compute intensive (and therefore less affected by the overhead of using these locks). ## Related Work; Part of #789, namely:; Improves scaling of the work from #861 #843 (should help with #894); Fixes a bug from #830. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/908:1712,update,updated,1712,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/908,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The objective is to provide a natural (i.e. readable) way to write code that extracts all the performance modern CPU have to offer. As described in the last update of #789 this will require completely different numerics classes, also to address other inefficiencies they have. For now all centered schemes and plain Roe have been ""ported"" (this also adds JST with matrix dissipation).; Most of the auxiliary CNumerics functions were also ported as consequence (inviscid fluxes, Jacobians, and so on) and so implementing new schemes only gets easier. If you want to test this, the new numerics are called for Roe on ideal gas without low Mach corrections (enabled by option USE_VECTORIZATION=YES) and also for centered schemes.; To get good performance on gcc you need the following optimization flags:; `-O2 -funroll-loops -ffast-math -march=?? -mtune=??` Where ?? should be something with AVX (e.g. `haswell`, `skylake`).; There are AVX and AVX512 specific optimizations.; Also the OpenMP simd directive is used, at least on gcc this makes a difference (because it is stubborn at vectorizing) so -Dwith-omp=true when calling meson.py.; You can expect around 30% speedup +- 10% on problems that do not need a lot of linear solver iterations, or more on machines with AVX512. ## Related Work; #789. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022:178,update,update,178,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; There was a bug in the CTurbSolver::ComputeUnderRelaxation() that would return a negative UR if the change in solution was too negative (less than the allowable decrease), which could cause the solution to head in the wrong direction. I'm not really sure why the turbulent solver version of this function was written differently than the flow solver (maybe the intention was to have a different allowable increase and decrease but they ended up being the same in the end?), but I changed it to make it consistent with the flow solver version. Also, as I mentioned in #1036, the UR parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. While on the topic of UR, I was wondering what the community's thoughts are on changing the SST models to use UR instead of solution clipping. The limits seem somewhat arbitrary to me (is there a ref?), and the tests I've done on my mesh adaptation cases have performed well where I've replaced clipping with UR. I realize this is a very limited dataset so if anyone has any strong opinions of why we should be clipping, let me know. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

This issue solves a problem reported by a number of users, when simulating radial turbomachinery cases a second-order accurate solution cannot be achieved in some cases when using mixing plane interfaces.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR adds a regression testing pipeline based on the new Github actions features (https://github.com/su2code/SU2/actions). It uses docker containers for building and running the tests (https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/build-su2 and https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/test-su2, respectively, based on Ubuntu18.04/gcc7.4/OpenMPI2). This has several advantages over the current (Travis based) system:. - Using the containers you can run the building/testing environment locally on your machine. You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible. Compiling and running all tests requires ~1h since a lot of things run in parallel now (e.g. building the base, reverse AD and forward AD binaries). There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes. Hence we cannot give any support in this regard. For production use it is recommended to use singularity containers. But: the docker containers can be used as basis layers for singularity. I will get back with more information on that topic. ~~I had to change regression test values of two cases since apparently they are compiler dependent.~~ I changed it to the same versions as we have on Travis.

I replaced this with the linear solver tolerance.; - The sum of nonlinear residuals was never computed for steady since `TimeIter` was used.; - The under-relaxation parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. @jayantmukho and I wanted to discuss more possible improvements to the scheme. I wanted to open this up before making any actual changes. - Currently there is a check for stalling residuals (the sum over 100 iterations of delta_Res must be > 0.1 Res), but this doesn't protect against increasing residuals. We should implement another check to prevent divergence.; - Instead of computing a single local CFL for flow/turbulence with a reduction factor for turbulence, maybe it would be better to have both solvers make their own call to `AdaptCFLNumber` and compute their own local CFL based on their own ResRMS. I feel like this would make more sense since the solvers are decoupled anyway. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

The P1 model is a popular 1-equation model to solve the infinite-dimensional Radiative Heat Equation (RHE) that works under the assumption that the energy distribution is linearly isotropic (1). The implementation is general and thought to allow further extension of the radiation solvers in SU2, e.g., to discrete ordinates or partial moment approximations.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This feature allows for computationally efficient through-flow computations for turbomachinery applications in the form of body-force modeling. The body-force model (BFM) generates density, momentum and energy source terms which turn the flow according to the local flow conditions and blade geometry. The blade geometry is defined through the camberline and blade thickness parameters, which are interpolated onto the mesh nodes prior to the solution process. ; Two BFM formulations are currently implemented: Hall (2015) and Thollet (2017). The code is up-to-date with ""develop"", version 7.1.1. ; Upcoming milestones will be MPI integration and coupling with adjoint. The latter will allow for computationally efficient design workflows of turbomachinery components. This will be especially useful for distortion-tolerant machines, as the design variable count and computational requirements are significantly higher than for machines experiencing uniform inflow. ; . ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

The full set of available fluids is presented in the **config_template.cfg** file. One must be aware that the reviewed fluid model assumes imposing pure substance in gas phase (no mixtures or multiphase flows).

However, making the matrix-vector product ""periodicity-aware"" through comms, without modifying the matrix, means that any preconditioner derived from the matrix is not consistent with the product, thus it is a worse preconditioner and more linear iterations are needed for the same reduction in residuals. ## Related Work; Should help #1467; Should avoid #763. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1585:1333,update,updated,1333,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1585,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a slight modification to the computation of face normals. Previously, the inputs to SetCoord_CG were swapped depending on whether iPoint < jPoint, but this can result in an inconsistent direction for the normals of each sub-face associated with edge i/j (i.e. for each element connected to edge i/j). This logic is replaced by dotting the sub-face normals with the edge vector from i to j (or j to i if iPoint > jPoint), and flipping the normal if the product is negative. This fix might be needed for the surface elements too, but I was less sure of what's going on in SetBoundControlVolume(). ## PR Checklist. - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1054:1007,update,updated,1007,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1054,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a solver I have been working on for some time.; The proposed solver is a treatment of the discrete adjoint sensitivities based on the idea of Sobolev gradient smoothing. This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2.; Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One Shot optimization context.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the finite elements features in SU2. It also includes the possibility to take the mesh parameterization into account and smooth the sensitivities w.r.t. the design parameters. I will update this draft and the comments, but I wanted to share this first version. I would be happy if anyone wants to comment on it. The draft needs some steps to be done, including:; - clean up the comments and make them consistent with SU2 style; - remove the dependency on Eigen. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This pull request represents progress towards exposing the mesh deformation routines and their adjoint counterparts to Python through pysu2 and pysu2ad, respectively. This refactorization introduced:. 1. `CDriverBase`; a. Parent class for `CDriver`, `CDeformationDriver`, `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver`; b. Common methods regarding geometry, markers, MPI, etc. 2. `CDeformationDriver` and `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver`. In addition, the `CDeformationDriver` was modified to use the new mesh deformation solver `CMeshSolver`. The integration of `CMeshSolver` required introducing the `numerics_container` and `solver_container`, as well as minor changes to `CMeshSolver` (e.g., `DeformMesh` and `SetMesh_Stiffness`). Both the legacy mesh deformation solver `SU2_DEF` and the newer `CMeshSolver` can be used with these new drivers, depending on how the `DEFORM_MESH` option is set in the SU2 config file. . ## Related Work; These efforts are related to Issue #1262. The purpose of this work is to enable the coupling of SU2 with external solvers like Nastran, particularly for aerostructural MDAO. The goal is to apply this for coupled discrete adjoint sensitivities. . In the future, these driver classes will be extended to include more methods accessible via Python (i.e., for setting or extracting variables, config parameters, etc.). Currently `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver` is not integrated with `CMeshSolver`, but this will be addressed in the future. . ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [ ] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300:545,integrat,integration,545,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300,3,"['integrat', 'update']","['integrated', 'integration', 'updated']"

A call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(Iter)` will check the stopping criteria, including the maximum number of iterations. When you have set this to 1 using `SU2Driver.Preprocess(1)`, a call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(0)` will still stop the calculations because we are checking if (iter+1)>=nIter. The second change is that we now check if (iter >= nIter). I also change this behavior for time dependent problems to make this behavior consistent. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; `CSlidingInterface::GetDonor_Variable` needs to access the `Primitive` of flow variables and the `Solution` of turbulent variables. Which one is the case, is currently decided by checking `donor_solution->GetnPrimVar() == 2` (true->turbulent, false->flow). If the SA turbulence model is used, the non-overidden ""virtual placeholder"" `CVariable::GetPrimitive(unsigned long,unsigned long) const` returning zero is incorrectly called. We propose to fix this by additionally checking for `donor_solution->GetnPrimVar() == 1`. ## Related Work; @maxaehle, @mcmorelli, @BeckettZhou, @EduardoMolina. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Note: For some reason this fixes a problem for the species transport, where the discrete adjoint solver would stop in computelimiters.hpp with the message ""unknown limiter type"". This only happens when a computation is run over more than one node (more than one core is OK though). This is because in CSolver::SetSolution_Limiter, GetKind_SlopeLimit() does not return a valid value for an existing slope limiter. Kind_SlopeLimit is set in CConfig::SetKind_ConvNumScheme, called in CConfig::SetGlobalParam, but this looks OK to me. .

Deployability,"## Proposed changes. Dear all,. I am very new to collaboration on a open source project, but I have been working on an update for the FSI computation in python that I think may be useful also for other researcher. Would you mind giving me a feedback about the modifications?. In few words, I have updated the python interface for fluid structure interaction to the new version of SU2, including the new driver, the new mesh deformation methods and few other modifications in the python scripts. It works with python3. As far as the C++ code is concerned, I only added the possibility to separate the symmetry boundary conditions for the fluid solver from the ones of the mesh solver. There is an explanation of this modification in the ReadMe file in SU2_PY/FSI_tools, together with an example of application. . The interface is still general and new structural solvers can be coupled by adding it to the fsi_computation.py file. With the present pull request I only include one structural solver, which provides a coupling with the commercial code Nastran. I added ReadMe files to explain in detail all the modifications and also the keywords to be used in the config files. Finally, there is also a complete test case where the flutter of a flat plate is studied. I am looking forward for your comments.

Here's a figure from reference [2]:. ![travinresults](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/42509822-bc677aea-8412-11e8-8285-6e51895258b4.png); ; And here's the results of my rough test:. ![roe_dissipation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/42510382-54f3b516-8414-11e8-9be4-07aafdd2468a.png). As you can see, the central/upwind blending function is doing what it's supposed to do. It's going to 0 in regions with both high vorticity and a fine grid, but goes to 1 in the near-wall RANS regions and in the outer region of the flow. There are a few artifacts around the cylinder, where the grid is fine but the eddy viscosity is still low. I'm talking about the few spots you see around the cylinder. There is a relatively high vorticity there, and the grid is fine, so the values make sense. It's hard to tell if this is due to imperfections in the grid, imperfections in the code implementation, or imperfections in the NTS model itself. ### References. 1. A. Travin, M. Shur, M.

Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory! So first I find the hardcoded paths of the makefile by running (on a bash terminal):; ```; grep -rn python2\.7 SU2_PY/ ; ```; On my system, this prints out four lines. I don't care about the `Makefile.in` files, because those are generated automatically and will be overwritten every time I run ""configure"" or ""preconfigure.py."" The `NUMPY_INCLUDE` line is also commented out, so I ignore that too. That leaves me with one line, line 51 of `SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am`:. ```; SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am:51:MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. I now modify line 51 of Makefile.am to read:. ```; MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. Then run configure or preconfigure.py again, and then run make again. You should be good to go!. #### tl;dr.

Deployability,"(I seem to have a knack to find cans of worms).; What I did in a55ca26 is not accurate, the integral of the fluid stress needs to be done in current coordinates and the normal available trough CVertex is in reference (undeformed) coordinates. I've implemented this in the structural solver as a preprocessing step. For each surface element of all FSI markers an average stress is computed based on its nodal values, it is then integrated in current (deformed) coordinates. A second pass over the elements scatters the force on the element to the nodes, this is to account for nodes that participate in multiple markers.; The mechanism by which the structural solver takes the flow tractions and updates the Residual vector was not changed, so this changes are fairly local.; The only downside I see is that knowledge of whether the interpolation is consistent or conservative is now required in two locations...

Deployability,"(I was not expecting this many comments so quickly, thanks guys!). First let me clarify the intent.; I do not propose replacing the routines that deal with CSysMatrix, or change its format, all that (Krylov solvers, sparse approximate factorizations, etc.) is relatively independent from what I have in mind.; Nevertheless being able to use PETSc or HYPRE would be interesting as it would give us access to AMG, and @talbring 's branch feature_template_linear_solver would make such an integration compatible with AD.; What I would like is to have a ""CMatrixDense"" class, to give concrete examples:; - For RBF interpolation the guy who worked on it before me implemented his own Cholesky and LU factorizations, matrix-matrix, matrix-vector routines, etc.; - @jayantmukho recently needed some eigenvector decomposition's for the uncertainty quantification feature.; - I imagine in some other places of the code similar routines were needed, for example small matrix inversion when computing gradients by weighted least squares (indeed what I need now is a QR decomposition). And, as an added bonus, I think some other areas of the code could be simplified / optimized by adopting a dense matrix format, for example:; - This snipped from the viscous numerics refactoring`for (iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++) {; TauElem[iDim] = 0.0;; for (jDim = 0; jDim < nDim; jDim++); TauElem[iDim] += tau[iDim][jDim]*UnitNormal[jDim];; }` would simply become `TauElem=tau*UnitNormal`; - Cumbersome allocations like `tau_jacobian_i = new su2double* [nDim];; for (iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++) {; tau_jacobian_i[iDim] = new su2double [nVar];; }` become `Matrix tau_jacobian_i(nDim,nVar);` and the cleanup is dealt with by the destructor of the object automatically.

Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push.

Deployability,"**Context**; I am working in a parallel MDO framework where one or several instances of SU2 (corresponding to different operating cases) can coupled with other solvers and tools, to perform coupled aero-structural shape optimisation. . The framework initialises MPI and assigns processors to the different solvers and tools as required. The SU2 instances are initialised and controlled through Python, and given a communicator for the relevant subset of the MPI processes. . **Issue**; Shape optimisation with SU2 (using discrete adjoints) require four operations at each major optimisation iteration:. 1. `SU2_DEF`: Deform the mesh according to the new design variables (or _design deformations_, in contrast to e.g. the _structural deformations_ in an aeroelastic analysis), and output the deformed mesh to file,; 2. `SU2_CFD`: Update the primal solution, which may include a mesh deformation due to structural deformations in an aeroelastic analysis, and output the converged state to file,; 3. `SU2_CFD_AD`: Update the discrete adjoint solution corresponding to the converged primal solution, once for each objective function of interest, and output the converged adjoints to file,; 4. `SU2_DOT_AD`: Calculate the surface sensititivities from the discrete adjoint solution (from what I can gather, this step is required in the discrete-adjoint sensitivity analysis to account for the in-direct influence surface deformations have on the objective through the volume deformation; essentially a differentiation of `SU2_DEF`), and output these to file. Currently, the SU2 Python wrapper exposes _driver_ classes which allow control of the execution of steps 2 and 3 described above, namely `CSinglezoneDriver` and `CDiscAdjSinglezonedriver` (among other variants). For steps 1 and 4 however, there is no such option: these steps must be executed by a ""command-line call"" in a newly spawned sub-process, as is done in the SU2 Python tools, in `SU2.run.DEF` and `SU2.run.DOT` respectively.

Deployability,"**Describe the bug**. Here is a description of the bug, and possible fix... Using the FAN_FACE_MACH boundary condition, which is implemented in the `CEulerSolver.cpp`, the `Inflow_Mach_old` returned is 0.0, causing the computation of the updated pressure to be incorrect. In practice, this drives the pressure lower and lower until it becomes negative. To find this, I added debug statements to `SU2_CFD/src/solvers/CEulerSolver.cpp` where the FAN_FACE_MACH BC logic is to iterate on the outflow pressure. . // cout << endl << ""PRINTING DEBUG INFO FOR FAN_FACE_MACH"" << endl;; // cout << ""Rank = "" << rank << endl;; // cout << ""Kind_Engine_Inflow = "" << Kind_Engine_Inflow << endl;; // cout << ""Target_Inflow_Mach = "" << Target_Inflow_Mach << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure_old = "" << Inflow_Pressure_old << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Mach_old = "" << Inflow_Mach_old << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure_inc = "" << Inflow_Pressure_inc << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure = "" << Inflow_Pressure << endl;. which resulted in the output:. PRINTING DEBUG INFO FOR FAN_FACE_MACH; Rank = 1; Kind_Engine_Inflow = 1; Target_Inflow_Mach = 0.64; Inflow_Pressure_old = 2.36396; Inflow_Mach_old = 0; ... So it seems the main issue is that in the `config` the `Inflow_Mach` quantity is never getting updated. I _believe_ this should happen in `src/solvers/CEulerSolver.cpp` starting at line 2855 `if (Engine) { ... ` . Here, a call to `config->SetInflow_Mach(iMarker_Inlet, Inlet_Mach_Total[iMarker_Inlet]);` is completely missing. I'm not familiar with the code base, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to be updated elsewhere. However, inserting that line appears to fix the problem and the above logic around FAN_FACE_MACH begins working as expected. **Reproduce**; Perhaps the only thing about my problem worth mentioning is it is ran as axisymmetric. I'm running RANS, with the SST model. . **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: [e.g., Linux (Centos 7)]; - C++ compiler and versi",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1607:238,update,updated,238,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1607,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"**Describe the bug**. You will have to bear with me, I might get some of this wrong, I am not entirely sure what is going on here so I will try and include as much information as possible. Using the tape tagging method developed by @oleburghardt in #2343 and presented at the most recent SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

Hi all,. The STL-file writer does not write quad surface elements (So far so good :) ). So in case of a Hexa-Grid (i.e. quad surface elements) the .stl is pretty much empty, which is not really what we want.; I will attach an image later (firewall's at it again) down below which shows a mixed surface mesh (tris and quads). On the left will be the current version of SU2 where quads are simply not written and on the right a fixed version where each quad is separated into 2 tris. ![stl_quads_tris](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/58827759-17667700-8644-11e9-9e6f-4643d2e7fdb7.JPG). That was found (and fixed) by Fabian Woerenkaemper @ElGarno . As the output is currently overhauled, I shortly chatted with its adoptive father @talbring and I will adapt the fixed STL-writer to the new structure and it will (hopefully) go into develop with that in a somewhat near future.

The problem disappears if I use smaller number of cores, e.g. 64, and everything will look normal (solution converges and SU2 exit normally). The actual number of MPI cores that triggers the bug seems to be problem dependent. I also ran a couple of finer grids but started to see the bug with 64 cores. For these finer mesh, reducing to a smaller number like 48 cores makes the problem disappear again.

Deployability,"**Describe the bug**; Certain meshes seem to get stuck at Geometry Preprocessing: Checking the numerical grid orientation. It will remain stuck indefinitely (I've only left it for up to 20 hours, however). This has only happened to prism meshes that I've generated with Pointwise's T-Rex function. However, it only seems to affect some of them. I should mention that the geometry has a very sharp and flat wingtip - sometimes the final few cells on the wingtip become 2D flat plates rather than 3D cells. Will SU2 handle these? I notice that not all meshes with 2D tips get stuck, but all the meshes that are stuck are meshes with 2D tips. (i.e. some meshes seem to run fine.). I'm not sure if this is a bug or user error but I've also attached some images to demonstrate what I mean.

Deployability,"**Describe the bug**; While doing shape optimization for drag minimization with the Euler solver, I received a negative drag for the optimized geometry. This seemed strange to me, so I investigated it and realized, that the CD in SU2 seems to be computed incorrectly in some cases. . During the investigation, I computed the drag force in Paraview based on the SU2 flow result and compared it to the drag force computed by SU2 both for the initial and the final optimization geometry. The results did not match, which is not what I would have expected. . In SU2, I compute the drag force by multiplying CD with the non-dimensional factor written to the forces_breakdown file. For Paraview, I wrote a script which does the following to compute the drag force:; - Load surface flow solution for the wing surface; - Compute surface normals; - Compute Drag = -Pressure*(Normals_X * cos(AoA/180 * 3.1415) + Normals_Z * sin(AoA/180 * 3.1415)); - Integrate this over the whole wing surface to get the total drag force. You can also find this Paraview script attached.; I validated the Paraview script for multiple simple testcases, for which SU2 and Paraview gave me exactly the same drag force. When I applied it to the initial optimization geometry, I however realized, that SU2 computes a drag force of 60.95 N while Paraview gets 143.6 N. Furthermore, for the final optimization geometry, Paraview computes 53.3 N while SU2 gets a drag force of -55.95 N. . To my understanding, the drag computed from pressure integration over the surface should be independent of the solver, the flow conditions and (ideally) even the programme. Furthermore, the Paraview result seems more trustworthy than the SU2 result as SU2 calculates a negative drag, which should physically not be possible, not even with the Euler equations. This leads me to the conclusion that there might be something wrong with the drag computation in SU2 for some geometries. Has anybody encountered a similar issue?

It is possible to notice that this difference does not emerge if the ROE scheme is used. For the 3D case, the boundary conditions at the side faces of the domain are `MARKER_SYM`, so that we think that this issue could be connected to the #1125 . **To Reproduce**; In order to reproduce the issue, a zip file is attached.

Deployability,*Update: the conflicts were due to mutually editing methods for the discrete adjoint; I had added some objectives prior to the recent discrete adjoint pull request. ; @talbring if you have a minute to take a look at how I've handled these objectives in iteration_structure.cpp that would be much appreciated.; I think I have resolved the conflicts; the source of most of the problems was with registering outflow-based objective functions which depend on values that were only calculated at an output step. This meant adding an if statement to calculate these values at the most recent point where the output container was available.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/204#issuecomment-151660107:1,Update,Update,1,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/204#issuecomment-151660107,1,['Update'],['Update']

The command used was:. ```; python3 $SU2_RUN/mesh_adaptation_amg.py -f adapt_Mesh.cfg -n 4; ```; The script initiates the mesh adaptation process as expected, with the following output:. ```; SU2-AMG Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation.

The critical part of this error seems to be the Error in TokenizeString() message, suggesting an issue with parsing the configuration file. This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch? Any insights, suggestions, or guidance on how to troubleshoot this error would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has a working adapt_mesh.cfg file for a similar setup or for the feature_adap branch, I would be very interested in seeing it. Understanding the configuration details of a working example could be highly beneficial in resolving my issue.

I've read paper and there are two kind of computing-dissipation-parameter method, SU2 seems mixed them. Whether it's legal?.

I am also attaching my python plotting results in case someone wants to reproduce the graphs and/or look at the equations in detail. [plotting_script.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/4217388/plotting_script.txt). Please note that the inlet file was created with random fluctuating values to ensure correct inlet interpolation is happening. Some values and patterns may look unrealistic. Additionally, note that Akima can extrapolate values as well but will display a warning if it is doing so. Linear will only do interpolation and will exit if the inlet file does not have the specific radius data. However, it will show on the console which radius data is missing so the user can add it. Also, currently, the flow should be in z-direction only. I don't know how to find the flow direction through any built-in method in SU2 during run. If you can tell me that I can update the code to support any flow direction. During interpolation, it will display that flow direction must be in z-direction to avoid any mistake by the user.

The lower surface is represented on the left, whereas the upper surface is on the right. At the moment the wind tunnel walls have not been taken into account. This can explain the spanwise shift of the transition with respect to the experimental results. More results are incoming. . Please, any suggestions on how to clean up the code or on how to make it more efficient are very well accepted. More comments to the code will be added in the following days. Especially to the declaration of some functions. I know that it is not the most good-looking code right now but I preferred uploading it now such that others can use it even if it is not really clean. . ## Related Work; Work is related to the PR #1751.

Deployability,"://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/test-su2, respectively, based on Ubuntu18.04/gcc7.4/OpenMPI2). This has several advantages over the current (Travis based) system:. - Using the containers you can run the building/testing environment locally on your machine. You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible. Compiling and running all tests requires ~1h since a lot of things run in parallel now (e.g. building the base, reverse AD and forward AD binaries). There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes. Hence we cannot give any support in this regard. For production use it is recommended to use singularity containers. But: the docker containers can be used as basis layers for singularity. I will get back with more information on that topic. ~~I had to change regression test values of two cases since apparently they are compiler dependent.~~ I changed it to the same versions as we have on Travis. There will be some documentation on how to use the containers locally soon. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

The purpose of this list is two fold:; - Direct the efforts of the SU2 Foundation towards addressing these issues, by efforts I mean funds (as they become available).; - Try to enlist help from the community to start addressing these issues, as much as possible we will try to break these down into ""bite sized"" chunks. **To be clear, all contributions are welcome, even if they do not fit in one of the categories below.**; **The main objective here is consolidation, making SU2 do more things well** (v&v'd, unit-tested, documented, etc.). ## Documentation; - Tutorials, trying to cover all areas of SU2 ([key priority according to the community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wgQDMiJ_mMqxiJ6FV8zZDu-CbxBjGXGeqrTAuJaTQkQ/edit#gid=1654711040)).; - Developer documentation (common ""how to's"", ~~update/simplify the info in [these pages](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Code-Review/)~~([done](https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io/pull/70)), etc.). ## Turbulence models; - Precise documentation of fluid and turbulence models **as implemented** in SU2, i.e. link to an authoritative reference and highlighting any deviation from it. #1364 #1551; - Code refactoring to simplify adding turbulence model variants. #1413; - V&V; - Scale resolving methods #1120; - Transition (documentation, tutorial, implementation of additional models) #1496; - Wall functions (documentation, tutorial testcase) #1204. ## Validation and Verification; - V&V of features that lack coverage (i.e. a particular fluid model, design variable, etc.), followed by regression test and ideally tutorial #581; - Put the V&V cases under regression to ensure they are up to date (similar to what is done with tutorials). ## Testing and test cases; - More unit tests #698; - Cleanup of TestCases to make them ""Minimum workin",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1487:1133,update,update,1133,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1487,1,['update'],['update']

I've decided to go with a single version of the code where the CPU and GPU implementations co-exist in the same linear solver and can be disabled or switched using a combination of Meson and Config File options. This is why I have defined three classes - one over-arching class that is named CExecutionPath that has two child classes - CCpuExecution and CGpuExecution. These child classes contain the correct member function for each path - CPU or GPU functioning. . All of this could also be easily achieved with an if statement that switches between the two - but that particular implementation will access and run the statement for each call. In our case once a Matrix Vector Product object is created, it will immediately know whether to use CPU or GPU mode of execution. . Recommendations are most welcome to improve or make this implementation better. ## PR Checklist. Warning Levels do come (only at level 3) but they are all of the following type. ```; style of line directive is a GCC extension; ```. The documentation for compiling with CUDA needs to be added by forking the SU2 site repo and adding the relevant changes to it? Or do I need to contact someone to change things on the site itself?.

Deployability,"=1/3 gives a third-order approximation to the derivative at the node (the value used in the Piperno limiter to achieve 4th order dissipation). The reasons for these additions are; - The Piperno limiter is implemented in Inria's Wolf solver and seems to be used in a lot of their mesh adaptation work (see these references for [Euler](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02378738v2/document) and [RANS](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01962318/file/these_archivage_3570223.pdf)); - Some preliminary tests with the Piperno limiter have converged solutions on triangulated BL meshes that @jayantmukho and I couldn't get to converge with other limiters in SU2 (e.g. triangulated DSMA661 meshes from TMR); - The MUSCL parameter exists in other solvers (FUN3D, CFL3D, Wolf) and is used by the NASA codes for many of the TMR cases (e.g. CFL3D uses 1/3 and FUN3D uses 1/2 for the DSMA661 case). Further testing still needs to be done on the effect of the MUSCL parameter with other limiters, but leaving the value as default won't affect any of the test cases. ## Relevant config parameters; Piperno limiter:; ```; SLOPE_LIMITER_FLOW= PIPERNO; ```; MUSCL parameter:; ```; % Parameter to control upwinding in MUSCL extrapolation; % Kappa = 1/3 for Piperno limiter, Default = 0 otherwise; MUSCL_KAPPA= 0.0; ```. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"> * From the history output it seems that the maximum CFL value is not being reached, even for small CFL values the update seems to stop one step before max. There was a small factor applied to keep it above and below the CFL min and max (1.001, 0.999), respectively. But I have removed that, since it is not necessary. Btw, I have added the ability to print the min/max time step, and min/max/avg CFL to the screen by adding MIN_DELTA_TIME, MAX_DELTA_TIME, MIN_CFL, MAX_CFL, AVG_CFL to the SCREEN_OUTPUT. > * I still see some residual oscillations with high CFL values (100-1000), I think the issue is that despite the oscillations the linear solver still converges fine, and so the reduction never kicks in. There are reduction checks for both the linear and nonlinear residuals, but they likely still need some tuning (the factors were just empirical from my tests). I am also finding in my tests that if I am having trouble with a particular RANS case, sometimes it is most effective to turn off the adaption and go for a fixed CFL of 250, 500, or even 1000, if stable (don't forget you may need NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES for that to be stable).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-541376224:116,update,update,116,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-541376224,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"> ; > ; > Dear Daumantas,; > ; > I appreciate your effort in adding support for cmake in SU2. We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs.; > ; > I am all ears to hear other opinions. However, let's not start a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages of the build systems. Some benefits can be found in the Issue/PR linked above. Ok, I tried meson with MinGW but couldn't figure out how to link with MSMPI since it's not a part of MinGW. However, using CMake and with a few source code fixes, I managed to compile nearly every configuration with MSVC. Surprisingly, there were very few errors in SU2. The externals only had a few preprocessor issues. At the moment only MeDiPack fails to compile with MSVC but not with MinGW even though the MPI headers are the same so I suspect it's an issue with MSVC itself, I'm using the latest preview version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450:1187,configurat,configuration,1187,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"> @kursatyurt Hello, thank you so much for the lead.; > ; > Our initial scope mostly involved writing our own kernels and I did explore some libraries at the start - I was planning on using CUSP as well but my main concern was its lack of being updated to the newly compatible versions of the toolkit. cuSolver and cuBLAS do exist, but I chose to go ahead with a ""simple"" kernel implementation to have more control. I also felt that if I could keep the block size of the grid in optimal territory then they could be just as fast as those options (please do correct me if my reading of the literature or the situation was incorrect). To learn the basics, it's a good idea, but for large-scale projects, I prefer using existing libraries if possible.; Those libraries generally exploit state-of-the-art solution like mixed-precision computing. A gaming GPU is not way faster than a good CPU in double precision, but way faster in single precision, most of them have 64:1 ratio, however server class GPU have 2:1 ratio. Also when available they use vendor libraries like cuBLAS or hipBLAS. It is always nice to have you only care about connection and somebody else handle the solver as performant as possible. In future probably they will provide more and more solvers and it will be automagically works.

So if the the option `ITER_DCL_DALPHA = 0` then it will do exactly what you suggest. It calculates the derivative based on the last update. The only problem with that is, there is no guarantee that the simulation at the previous update was converged, so the derivative might be incorrect. .

I will go through it again to remove any unnecessary includes that might have crept in. . > Apart from the two comments below, I would add that it would be nice to put virtual (`override` or `final`) and `const` specifiers where appropriate, at some point, not necessarily now.

Or shall we do that separately?. The implementation for the turbulence models is correct as is. No flux is considered for the convective and viscous fluxes by inserting the symmetry conditions directly in the FV derivation. Convective fluxes vanish as velocity*normal=0, viscous fluxes vanish by grad(transported scalar)*n=0 on the symmetry faces of the boundary. Above I denoted that as ""direct flux"" approach. ; (I will attach an updated pdf here later).

Deployability,"> SU2 is a fantastic library, but the build process is really painful to get static linking within another C++ program. CMake is a standard for building C++ projects and would be extremely helpful. Ideally Python wouldn't be necessary to build SU2 or link it with another project. I'm not sure I understand this... the fact that the build system uses python means that it is really painful to configure the build system to emit a static library? (This should absolutely not be the case! Meson has a core option `-Ddefault_library={static|shared|both}` to select what kind of library you want to build, for any library whose build description claims it can support either one. It's a bit like cmake's `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` except much more powerful.). However, as far as I can tell, su2 doesn't mark any of its libraries as public at all (i.e., installable) so maybe that's a moot point. As far as making python be necessary to build the project, I think this mainly boils down to ""I myself use cmake, I have cmake installed, I don't want to install another program when I could use the program I already have"".

Deployability,"> Thank you for updating the solution file @snow54 , there's quite a big difference in the adjoint residuals, do the final derivatives still make sense?

In terms of flow field, the capture below is from the current develop branch. The boundary between structured grid and unstructured gird is a nearfield boundary.

I think the residuals for direct solver will be different like the adjoint if you run it for some hundreds more iterations (currently, the test case has only 20 iterations).

Deployability,"> There are 2 cases in the testcases repository, both are using the Euler solver. Maybe also check if your case is running correctly with the settings from those testcases. Earlier, I was defining the mesh movement for the static zone as:. ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. since it was stationary. However, after checking the test cases, I found that the stator zones should also be defined as moving as. ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0 ; ```. even though the mesh stays stationary. In that case, the unphysical flow results I presented earlier vanished. Earlier, I tried the cylinder test case with the inner zone having . ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0; ```. and the outer zone having; ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. where the simulation gave physically viable results. I guess the zone interface may not accurately work if the `GRID_MOVEMENT` options of the neighbouring zones do not match while one of the zones has a non-zero movement. However, I have not simulated any other test cases. Also, the sliding_interface/rotating_cylinders test case diverges with the given .cfg files. At around the 775th time step, I received the following error message:. `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected). `.

One could even keep `SST` while adding a warning that `SST` will be deprecated in the future and that `SST-1994` is the equivalent successor. The upside of doing it like that is that it wouldn't interfere that much with peoples cases (only little cfg change necessary to produce the same results) and it would be much less work for you to change all the regression tests. And although the 2003-version is supposed to be an update to the 1994 version, I would bet there are people who prefer the 1994 version by choice. After all, when the Ancients first implemented SU2 they chose 1994 despite the 2003 version being around for 10 years already. I would be ok with switching to 2003m completely but I dont see really see the benefit as it means more work for everybody (right?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1557#issuecomment-1060630539:698,update,update,698,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1557#issuecomment-1060630539,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"> the off-PR comments can be integrated in this PR to clear that up a bit. If not that is OK as well. It's more than OK, the CHT implementation suffers a bit from being a single person's project.. you're very welcome to have a look over it! :-). > Can you add that option to the config_template.cfg together with that description, the valid inputs and the default. Actually I'm hesitating a bit adding it to the config template right now. I'd prefer to have `DIRECT_TEMPERATURE_ROBIN_HEATFLUX` as the default and ""hide"" the rest as developer's options for the moment.; The reason simply is that those different methods need to checked and validated against each other before we make them public.; E.g.

Deployability,"@EduardoMolina : Nice results! Thanks for the comments. You are seeing more warnings bc I did in fact change the tolerance that controls the warning. But, note that this tolerance only controls when to print the warnings, so the matches should have still be the same (nearest neighbor after transformation). . The reason is that the new implementation assumes a 1-to-1 matching of the nodes and surface elements on either side of the periodic face. To be consistent, the points/faces on either side should match exactly so that they can be summed into a complete dual control volume (this assumption is made in the implementation and the partial residuals are summed as such). Nice catch on the fem_solver check. I will add that to the conditional. Thanks for the review @rsanfer.

It uses goal-oriented (adjoint-based) adaptation instead of feature-based (just based on Mach or pressure) that Vic's fork used. Some things to note:; 1. It's currently only tested on Euler (it uses a Hessian of the Euler fluxes so it might work for NS/RANS, but probably not) (@WallyMaier and I also extended it to TNE2 in [feature_amgtne2](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_amgtne2) but the source terms are giving us trouble on adapted meshes); 2.

After going through the code a bit, it looks like doing this would be a good starting point for implementing ability to adjust deltaT mid-runs, as in general the code presumes `TimeIter*deltaT` as being the current time. This would be problematic for unsteady restarts that have a varying timestep. Plus, this would allow one to, without using the Python wrapper, use a different timestep in the config file for an unsteady restart. It also may clear up some confusion to have an explicit option for this, as in #2071. It can maybe look something like:. % Start time for restarting unsteady simulations; % = -1 for default calculation (START_TIME=RESTART_ITER*TIME_STEP); START_TIME=-1.

Deployability,"@clarkpede @EduardoMolina : yep, the issue is that the periodic and MPI communications are tangled up together in the current implementation. The main issue occurs when there are periodic points that are also ghost nodes. . Ideally the periodic and MPI would be separated, and the periodic communications would happen first so that all periodic BCs are synchronized before trying to send across partitions. Right now, the comms are mixed, so sometimes, we send old data at periodic points to their matching pair, which then gets updated in a later MPI comm. Therefore, the second call you have added to the MPI resends the periodic update to with the correct data that was updated with MPI in the first call. I hope this is clear.. Anyway, please go with this change as you have it. All of the MPI and periodic comms will be replaced with a cleaner/separated version right after v6.2.0 (you can see what I am working on in feature_mpi_periodic).

Deployability,"@clarkpede: thanks for organizing - it would be great to have your help on this topic. I'll let the others comment on the status of those branches, but in general, we have 2 major issues:. 1. Numerous bugs in the creation of the initial periodic BCs and new mesh file generated by SU2_MSH (ordering, inability to treat adjacent periodic markers, e.g., triply-periodic cube, and others). The branches above contain some fixes, and we should also merge in your #500 too. 2. Runtime issues in SU2_CFD, especially in parallel.

Deployability,"@economon I was envisioning something similar to the TestCases folder. With v&v cases grouped according to what they are testing. Something along the lines of: . 1) Inviscid Simulations: ; a) 2D Inviscid bump; b) 2D oblique shocks interaction; c) ...; 2) RANS simulations: ; a) Flatplate; b) NACA0012; c) ...; 3) Unsteady simulations:; a) Square Cylinder; b) ...; 4) Turbomachinary: ; a) ... And so on. Each of the directories would have sub-directories for different mesh sizes, with configuration files for each mesh level that have optimized parameters for best results. So for example if we are talking about the NACA0012 case, we would have something along the lines of: . a) NACA0012; i) 113 x 33; ii) 225 x 65 ; iii) 449 x 129; iv) ... This way we have a family of meshes and configuration files that are specifically built for the purpose of validating the code and comparing with other solvers. I might be useful to compress meshes that are larger than a certain size (say 10MB). We should also put a limit on the size of a single mesh that the repository can handle (say 50MB?). . Within the home directory, the README file should list all the cases in the repository, who the custodian of the test case is (person with meshes in case the meshes are too large), and which version it was last run on. . I thought about splitting it up into Verification cases and Validation cases, but I thought it would be more informative and intuitive to split up according to the physics of the simulations. My thinking might be limited because that's how I have seen the TestCases folder organized, so any other suggestions are welcome. I think it is imperative that this is accompanied with a section on the SU2 website that showcases just the results of the validation test cases (grid convergence studies, residual reductions etc) and links to the v&v repo appropriately. This way, if people are just inquisitive about SU2's performance, they can get a quick snapshot of the results, without the need ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/581#issuecomment-426026053:485,configurat,configuration,485,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/581#issuecomment-426026053,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

But sometimes the test values for the regression tests are changed during development and then we lose the guarantee. . From the viewpoint of being rigorous, I agree with the suggestion to run the v&v cases before a major release like 7.0 and also with @erangit on keeping track of the last version that they were run for. I am unsure about holding the people who add the test cases responsible for re-running them. Circumstances change, and access to resources change. That may make it hard for people to run the v&v cases. . I also think it is a good idea to have the effort be collaborative so people can add cases.

I already talked to some people about that and the conclusion was often that we should get rid of the current python framework and rely solely on the in-memory python wrapper functionalities. From what I can tell this is also what you would suggest. I have some additional things to add here:. - We should keep in mind other things than ""just"" shape optimization problems.; - The surface parameterization should be more or less independent of all the other things, so that we can easily integrate other tools/methods. In a first step it might be a good idea to just put all the FFD stuff into a separate (c++) library with a python interface.; - As you already mentioned, I am currently working on a more general way of defining output fields and in particular also objective functions in #913. I will add more information to this PR soon. The new python implementation should, in theory, not need to know about the specific objective function, but rather just asks for the value and the (surface) gradient. ; - We have to expose more c++ classes/functions to python.

As for post-processing, the objective function calculation can be quite complex in the use-cases Beckett and I have encountered. That's why it's run as a post-processing step, rather than updated continuously during runtime.

Our initial scope mostly involved writing our own kernels and I did explore some libraries at the start - I was planning on using CUSP as well but my main concern was its lack of being updated to the newly compatible versions of the toolkit. cuSolver and cuBLAS do exist, but I chose to go ahead with a ""simple"" kernel implementation to have more control. I also felt that if I could keep the block size of the grid in optimal territory then they could be just as fast as those options (please do correct me if my reading of the literature or the situation was incorrect).

Deployability,"@mheimgartner it would be helpful to compare the full residual history of the two regression Testcases before and after this last commit. (you prob already have the ""old"" histories and just have to do 2 new ones, you know best how the case beahaves etc). The commit I added will fail the regression test but I strongly believe the Pseudo-time update, convective and viscous Jacobians were wrong. . A reason this went unnoticed might be because the densities were O(1), so disregarding them in the solution update after the Linear Solver acts some kind of Relaxation Factor (which can be larger 1 depending whether density < or > 1). And I guess that could be fixed via CFL or this CFLReductionFactor anyway.; The Jacobians were taking with respect to Y alone, which is not correct. They have to be taken with respect with rho*Y, the transported variable imo. The conv Jacobian is arguably the most important one (and tested alone showed the biggest lift in residual improvement). ; I briefly checked the BC's and DualTimeRes for this Jacobian problem. For the BC's I found no hand-derived Jacobians and DualTimeRes seems ok (but is not used afaik).; Note that if one got a case to convergence(=> Res ~=0) the Jacobians and pseudo time derivative do not matter of course at that point. So comparing fully converged solution should show only marginal/no differences.

Deployability,"@talbring Thanks for the quick and helpful answer! I'm looking at creating an ebuild/package for gentoo, compilation is a lot simpler than OpenFoam :P which is a big plus :). Anyway, I was looking at the old docs (the main docs still point to 6.0, I missed the red text that mentioned that somehow :P), not sure why, but you're right it's indeed mentioned in the 7.0 docs here https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/#configuration-and-compilation. The ""Automatically installed dependencies"" section left me a bit confused because it sounded like the things listed there, which includes meson and ninja, would always get installed.; Maybe merging that section into the configuration and compilation section might help to make it more clear?. If you don't mind I have some additional questions:; - I didn't initialize the git submodule at all and configuration, compilation and running worked fine. Does this mean the CoDiPack and MeDiPack dependencies are optional? Or does this mean I could have a crash at runtime somewhere?; - Would it be possible to add a source package to the GitHub releases (in addition to the binary ones) that includes the (CoDiPack and MeDiPack) submodules? Unfortunately the GitHub provided source downloads don't include submodules.; - Are MKL and OpenBLAS build-time and exclusive options or can they both be compiled in and chosen at runtime?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/911#issuecomment-598751341:434,configurat,configuration-and-compilation,434,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/911#issuecomment-598751341,6,"['configurat', 'install', 'release']","['configuration', 'configuration-and-compilation', 'installed', 'releases']"
Deployability,"@talbring Thanks. That second link is very informative. I think that SU2 could really use a more advanced build process, and meson seems like a good candidate. As an example of why I think SU2 needs a better build process: Right now for AD builds, the build process listed in the tutorial asks you to use the `preconfigure.py` script to download and update the codi and medi git submodules. But there's a couple problems with the preconfigure script. It doesn't support out-of-source builds, and it expects all configure arguments to come in ""option=value"" pairs. A good build process (using CMake or meson) should allow adding submodules or external packages easily, without problems like these.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507:350,update,update,350,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"@talbring That was a good point about placement. I was able to move this implementation to a function called `FixedCL_Convergence()` in the euler solver class. It also allowed me to make it a little more robust. Since it still requires information about the convergence that is calculated in the integration container, the method has to be called `CFluidIteration::Iterate()`. I included the details of the implementation in the Constant CL tutorial on the website. That is in a pull request for the website. Consequently, that [pull request ](https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io/pull/16) needs to be approved first so that the regression test for this one can pass.

Deployability,"@talbring: thanks for adding the regressions. One iteration is perfect just to check they're running, if they have the originals still being tested in the TestCases. I think the idea of having the written tutorials/documentation for the test cases in the main repository is a very good one, for several reasons. In particular, it will make it easier for people to add documentation, and we could eventually even test for its existence in Travis or make it a strict requirement for PRs in the future. My only concern at the moment is making sure that they look ""nice"" when viewed and that the links are easy to update/follow. We should probably add a title at the top of each tutorial markdown file now (above the first image), since the titles from the wiki page are missing. The image files should be moved from the website repo (su2code.github.io/github_wiki/) to these Tutorials folders.

Deployability,"@timjim333 it could be an issue with shared libraries, which ultimately is a path issue, as you suspected.; To verify it try opening a python shell, checking the version displayed (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Fo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130:324,install,installed,324,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130,4,['install'],"['install', 'installed', 'installing']"

Deployability,"@vdweide, our (Tecplot’s) development compiler has been GCC 5, which gives no warnings with those flags. With GCC 9, ignoring warnings from Boost and OpenMPI (on Fedora 30), I see three types of warnings: (1) clause does not guard… (misleading indentation), (2) Implicitly-declared operator= is deprecated, and (3) writing to an object of type…use copy-assignment or copy-initialization instead. (1) Is a side-effect of code obfuscation (the reason management lets us release this code), and is probably unavoidable.; (2) and (3) are probably addressable. I’ll put these on my to-do list.

I already replaced almost all error messages in the code. - More MPI functions are included in the MPI Wrapper. - The rank/size is now stored in most of the bigger classes and initialized in the constructor. That means there are no calls to MPI_Comm_rank / MPI_Comm_size anymore in every routine ...

Deployability,After some testing I can report the following:. - With Jacobian contributions disabled convergence is greatly increased and on-par with the isothermal/heat flux configurations; - After around 12800 timesteps the solution diverges and SU2 crashes.; - For some reason the global flowfield is drastically different between convective and isothermal/adiabatic cases. As the convective case is somewhere between adiabatic and isothermal conditions this should not be the case. Here you can see a comparison of pressure between convective case (top) and isothermal case (bottom).

Deployability,"All,. For whatever it is worth, here are some thoughts. It is clear that we need to strike the right level and hierarchy of abstraction: at the highest level one really ought to be describing the physical problem, not the number of zones or the specific time-stepping algorithm that would be used. But preventing future multi-zone calculations from reaching the (time) order of accuracy desired is also an important issue that SU2 must support (and that I think would be very important for those doing unsteady turbomachinery calculations). Just as important: even for multi-physics problems (say fluid-structure interaction, when the fluid and structural solvers are not closely integrated into the same source) we need to ensure that the time accuracy of the full multi-physics calculation is as high as those of the component physics solvers. This is a very valid and useful discussion and some proposals are on the table. Given that we are planning a developer’s meeting sometime before the end of the year, this may actually be one of the items in the agenda for discussion, so some decisions can be reached that both make sense and minimize the pain of changes for any part of the existing code. I would suggest that the conversation continue and that other proposals are put forward so the discussion can be finalized at the developer’s meeting. Best,. Juan.

I agree with you that the outer loop should be the loop over the number of physical disciplines involved in the problem and not the zones. Whether the individual disciplines contain one or multiple zones is irrelevant at this level, in my opinion. The loop over the multiple zones of a single discipline should take place at a much lower level, namely where the spatial residual is computed.

Deployability,"All,. Thanks for getting this going. My two cents:. 1. Indeed, while these V&V cases and the TestCases directory / repo are not identical, there is some overlap…some of the TestCases are definitely validation cases too. We can continue to add test cases to the TestCases repo, knowing that only a subset of those cases belong in the V&V list. 2. An important aspect of the V&V is the convergence of the solution as the mesh is refined. As Jayant knows well, this can help us catch bugs. This means that a well-constructed V&V suite needs to include a series of meshes (of increasing density), the corresponding configuration files, and the actual experimental data (or other numerical data from runs on different solvers). I strongly agree with the suggestions made that (a) the entire V&V suite needs to be run before every major release (with configuration files updated), (b) that this should be linked form the main SU2 page, (c) that the 2014 AIAA paper (and Tom’s AVIATION 2018 paper) should serve as a starting point, (d) that the NASA TMR website can give us ideas of additional access, and (e) that the SU2 V&V page should be managed within GitHub.com<http://GitHub.com> so the entire community can edit / add to this / these page/s to continue to grow the number of cases and their relevance.

Deployability,"An update... I've run a few other cases and noticed something else. It turns out that option NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON has a significant impact on the channel flow with periodic boundaries. ![xz_roe_comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6933834/98713194-245cbf00-233c-11eb-9f9e-94f4b301a626.png). 1) In this picture, the streamwise and​ spanwise boundaries are periodic.; - The top two images in this picture are from a run without NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON. As you can see, there is a lot of garbage in the corners, and the simulation does not converge well.; - The bottom two images are from a run with NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON set to LEAST_SQUARES.; - Note that in both cases, NUM_METHOD_GRAD is set to GREEN_GAUSS. ![x_roe_comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6933834/98713350-5cfc9880-233c-11eb-83f2-89c3d9889739.png). 2) In this picture, only the streamwise boundaries are periodic, while the spanwise boundaries are symmetry.; - Again, the top to images in this picture are from a run without NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON. This time, there is no real issue in the corners, but there is some weirdness on the top and bottom boundaries (although, the perturbations are small).; - The bottom two images are from a run with NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON set to LEAST_SQUARES. It looks like an entry for NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON was *just* added to the config_template.cfg (there was not one there, previously), but I'm wondering if the behavior in the periodic boundary corners is expected if the gradient reconstruction option is not used, or does that indicate something wrong there? I'm not sure I understand why the periodic boundaries would pose an issue for the scheme without the gradient reconstruction. .

Deployability,"Attaching some results for the RAE2822 of the pressure field zoomed in right near the shock on the upper surface. The results do change (lift and drag by a couple percent) mostly due to a change in shock position it seems. The pressure field also shows the same behavior referenced above when the term is included. Unfortunately, we do not have much data to compare with here, since this case is not on the TMR. The integrated quantities above for the bump problem do not appear to be too sensitive to it either way, but the pressure field does indeed show the same discrepancies. In general, I have not been able to find any strong arguments for or against including the term in literature/codes. Although it is prescribed by the theory, some folks mention it is sometimes dropped (TMR also says it is sometimes ignored unless supersonic), or it gets dropped without mention at all. It is certainly affecting the pressure distribution, so we should take that into consideration. It is possible that there is some other bug that gets exposed by its inclusion, but I did not come across anything yet. As we know the SA model does not exhibit this behavior, I lean toward removing it.

Which would reduce the number of comms going in/out of each node (which is what the hybrid solver hopes to achieve). I remember seeing output messages from CFX indicative of similar strategies.

Deployability,"Dear @cvencro,; Great upgrade of the interface treatment! ; I was wondering what happens in case the structural solver is not the internal one, but rather an external solver coupled via Python. I think, in that case, the BC_velocity cannot be applied as there is information missing (we usually only transfer the displacement via python).; The solution to this, with minimum modifications, would be to slightly change the result of GetFSI_simulation. Indeed, at the moment, it checks if there is a marker_fluid_load or if there are both the structural solver and the fluid solver.; I was thinking that we may leave only the second check (i.e. if there are both the structural solver and the fluid solver), so that we avoid any problem.

Deployability,"Dear @rsanfer,. I agree with you that the outer loop should be the loop over the number of physical disciplines involved in the problem and not the zones. Whether the individual disciplines contain one or multiple zones is irrelevant at this level, in my opinion. The loop over the multiple zones of a single discipline should take place at a much lower level, namely where the spatial residual is computed. At least, this should be the case for the fluid dynamics part. I don't know whether this is also the case for other disciplines, like structures. What about the following high level structure?. - Loop over the number of iterations, or time steps for unsteady problems.; - Loop over the number of pseudo-time steps for implicit time integration schemes; (DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND). For other cases this loop is 1.; - Loop over the number of disciplines involved; Call iterate for each of the disciplines.; In iterate: ; - Loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages; - Loop over the zones of a single discipline; Compute spatial residual.; Update the state vector.; - End loop over the zones of a single discipline.; Exchange halo data. This includes the halo data between zones of a single discipline.; - End loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages ; - End loop over the disciplines; - End loop over the pseudo time steps.; - End loop over the number of iterations, or time steps for unsteady problems. The weakness of this approach is that it still does not work when one would like to employ multi-stage time integration schemes for an unsteady, multi-disciplinary problem (does not work for the current implementation either), but maybe this is something we simply have to accept. The alternative is that all the details of the different time integration schemes have to be moved to the driver classes, which is highly undesirable, I think. The structure above implies that the iteration_container and the integration_container should be defined per discipline and not per zone anymore.

Deployability,"Dear @vdweide,. I clearly see your point. However, this can be quite a big structural change of the code and I think we should plan very well how to address this issue. The reason of having a driver class was to facilitate the extension of SU2 to multi-physics applications both for analysis (direct solver) and design (adjoint). Thanks to the high level of abstraction of the CInterpolator, CTransfer and the CIteration classes, it was kind of natural to treat fluid-fluid problems similarly to multi-physics problem (i.e. fluid-structure and fluid-heat). As a matter of fact, the multi-stage turbomachinery approach , its adjoint counterpart, the sliding interface they all rely on this driver structure in which we loop among all the zones. If i understood correctly, you suggest to move only the fluid-fluid multi-zone loop at lower level in order to integrate in time only after having coupled all the fluid zones. Right? If so, we need to design the code in such a way that the fluid zones loop is separated from the multi-physics one.; To solve this issue, I think, we just need to find a smart way to differentiate fluid-zones from the rest. Perhaps we can do that by instantiating one Iteration per physical problem instead than per zone. So that inside the iteration we can couple all the fluid zones, and in the driver we can couple the different physics (Iteration). Indeed, this is just a preliminary idea. In general I think we should aim to a structure that can flexibly accommodate multi-physics problems with multi-zones for different physics. A good example is solving fluid-structure in multi-stage turbomachinery, in which we have multiple fluid-zones and multiple structure-zones. ; ; I would like to hear on this matter also from @fpalacios @talbring , @economon , @rsanfer @oleburghardt ,@LaSerpe and @arubino.

Deployability,"Dear Developers, . I have been trying to run the ""Constrained shape design of a transonic inviscid wing at a cte. CL"" tutorial but am having issues in installing SU2 properly. I realize that the SU2 tools necessary for this tutorial are not included with the binary executables and I have been working on properly configuring and building SU2 to have the necessary tools and to run in parallel by following the compilation guide. Unfortunately, I have yet to install a working parallel version to run this tutorial.

Deployability,"Dear all,. as many of you know, we have been working for quite a while in the development of the FSI solver within SU2. So far, we have been using a separate branch; however, this branch has grown quite big (almost 200 commits!) and it's probably time to merge it with the develop branch. This way, other folks can start using the new code infrastructure for multi-physics problems, while reducing the hassle for everyone in future pull requests from our side. . This pull request includes, among others:; 1. Multi-physics support and improvements: ; - CTransfer structure with MPI support for parallel multi-zone simulations.; - CTransfer subclasses for physical definition of multi-physics interaction variables.; - CInterpolator structure with support for interpolation algorithms.; 2. A FEM structural solver aiming to deal with geometrical and material nonlinearities.; 3. A BGS driver structure for FSI problems.; 4. General bug fixes and improvements for unsteady problems with dynamic meshes.; 5. New configuration options required for the different kinds of problems tackled. If all the tests pass, I will add some regression tests, once the mesh files and solution files have been added to the TestCases repository. Please note that this version of the code is still under development, and we are currently working on further improvements in the efficiency and the capabilities of the solver. We intend to include these further developments by the time of the next release of the code. . Cheers,.

Deployability,"Dear all,; Thank you very much for your comments!; I agree with you, transferring the velocity is definitely the best solution in the long run. However, as Pedro mentioned, there is also the case when a certain imposed deformation is set, without solving any structural system. This is the case of a forced motion. In the python script configuration files it is required to set the marker_fluid_load as this is the only way to make SU2 compute the tractions at that marker. Maybe, a solution to both needs, can be to make SU2 compute the tractions anyway for the wall boundary. . In this way, if you have the velocity at the interface, you can define this interface as also marker_fluid_load, the FSI bool will be true and the new BC_velocity will be used. If you do not have the velocity at the interface, you will avoid marker_fluid_load and SU2 will not fail trying to use bc_velocity. This will also give me more time to develop, from the python side, the required modifications to use the new interface.

Stock up your supplies, cancel meetings for today and dive into the diff to review this piece. Ok for real, I don't know if that is all that has to be done? I did some early testing with mixed results, I noticed that I had to turn down CFL for the solid zone (1e4 in non-periodic case-> 1) to get a solution that seems to respect the periodicity. If the CFL is too large then I get some spurious temperature and weird residual pattern. Any comments are appreciated.

Deployability,"Dear reader, . Let me give a little bit background first:. When a massflow is prescribed for periodic flow (`KIND_STREAMWISE_PERIODIC= MASSFLOW`), then a pressure drop is iterated(/adapted in each iteration) to fulfill that massflow requirement. In the Volume Source term only this pressure drop is used. The initial value at solver start is the value given in `STREAMWISE_PERIODIC_PRESSURE_DROP= ??` and for restarted/adjoint simulations the `STREAMWISE_PERIODIC_PRESSURE_DROP` from `flow.meta` is taken. Now this PR:. Until now, the update of the pressure drop, based on the difference between current and prescribed massflow, was done in the Flow solver Preprocessing. That causes some trouble as that routine is called multiple times during normal starts, restarts and even twice(!) for every normal iteration. So do not put any iterated quantities in those like I did. I now did put the update right in front of where it is used -> in the Source_Residual. Like so there shoulnd't be that much trouble of correct taping in that one iteration for the adjoint and it makes the logic of `Inner_iter/outer_iter==0` etc unnecessary. I am not sure the changes up until now are necessary but I am not sure whether they are enough tbh. I will update this description accordingly:. Update: So to give you an idea of the current state of gradient validation. My setup is the good'ol 2D periodic Pin case (fluid-only) with the Design variables being FFD-parameters only around the middle pin (so no Periodic Interface shenanigans up to now) and I have 4 OF: Avg_Temp and Drag on the middle-Pin Surface as well as the Pressure-drop between In/outlet plus massflow through in- OR outlet (which is the same in value but maybe not for the gradient :thinking: ):; 1. For prescribed pressure drop I get a very good agreement for Avg_Temp and Drag (below 0.1% relative diff across the board).; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/152566341-c2d7dc06-c968-41d4-b655-6ba94c211684.png); For Mass",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1536:535,update,update,535,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1536,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Doh, of course. Took a while to get some orientation in the code, but before implementing something I'd just like to clarify a few things:. As far as I can see the window size changes each time a new sample is added and the new average is immediatly recomputed and cached in `val`.; https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/72b2fa977b64b9683a388920f05298a40d39e5c5/SU2_CFD/src/output/COutput.cpp#L1916-L1928; I didn't find any other references to `WindowedUpdate` or `addValue`. Consequently it doesn't really make sense to cache the sum over n-1 samples, right?. Assuming that the windowing-function cannot change at runtime I'd propose the following changes:. - Add a new constructor to CWindowedAverage which takes the windowID as input parameter and stores it in a const field.; - Initialize the map that stores the CWindowedAverages in the COutput constructor with CWindowedAverage objects constructed with the WindowId specifed.; - Merge the code that updates the average (`WindowedUpdate`) into `addValue`, since both are currently called successively anyway. Delete `WindowedUpdate` function.; - Modify `addValue` to only store history for non-trivial windows. Another option might be to make CWindowedAverage (or `CWindowingTools`) an abstract class with `GetWndWeight` as pure virtual function that needs to be implemented for concrete windows. This would get rid of the duplicate code and switch-statements in CWindowedAverage. The constructor of COutput would then have to initialize the map with the right concrete class.

Deployability,"Dr. Economon,; It turns out that the latest version of the SU2 prints the outputs that I needed (Cfx Cfy and Cfz). So, I created the surface streamlines, along with pressure coefficient distributions for comparison, and you can find it in the attached document . There are also some results from other studies in the literature in the attached document. ; It seems to me that, the NREL case may not be the best case for validating our model. Comparing the results in the literature, none of the surface streamlines agree well with eachother. In the absence of experimental data, it is difficult to tell which one is more reasonable. I would be happy if you would also comment on these results.; Also, I wonder what the next step is. Is there anything else that you require us to do before merging the model into the master code? I think if the transition model was released officially, the community may apply the transition model to different test cases that we may not heard of or the proprietary ones. .

Deployability,"Eduardo,. Thanks for the papers. I think we need to spend a little time verifying that everything is still ok in the old preconditioning implementation. You're correct that we are computing the dual time source, i.e., the time derivative term discretized using BDF2 for instance, within CEulerSolver::SetResidual_DualTime(). However, it looks to me that in Eqn. 18 of Weiss and Smith, these terms are not affected by the preconditioning (the right-hand side of Eqn. 18 is what we have implemented currently, and I think it is ok). But, you're right about needing to precondition the pseudo-time term, which eventually goes to zero. One major difference for us from that paper is the scheme we use to relax the pseudo-time problem. They are using an explicit multi-stage scheme, while we are solving with a fully implicit scheme. While they will compute the update of ∆Q in Eqn. 18 by inverting that small matrix locally at each node, we will smooth our global linear system that resulted from our implicit discretization to get solution updates at all nodes. Therefore, when they add the Gamma term on the left-hand side locally, I think we should be adding that to the diagonal of our larger system matrix. In fact, we are doing something like this already, but I think we should double-check that everything is ok. Can you please look at CEulerSolver::ImplicitEuler_Iteration() to make sure the implementation for the preconditioning there is correct?.

Deployability,"Edwin,. I think it is a good idea to be able to have some level of control over the application of the wall functions on a marker-by-marker basis: as you say, it would be fairly common to have a wing marker where integration to the wall makes sense and a fuselage marker where wall functions (or even an inviscid BC) is the right thing to do. So let’s indeed do something like what Tom suggests (in the spirit of MARKER_MONITORING) so that one can control which markers get wall functions applied. If a list of markers is not specified in the config file, the default behavior should be that all no-slip walls get wall function BCs. If a list of markers is specified, then those and only those markers listed get wall function Bfs (with the others getting integration to the wall treatment).

Deployability,"Feature: Blade element momentum (BEM) method for variable load actuator disk modelling of propellers. ## Proposed Changes. The present work is on modifications to the actuator disk model. Variable load actuator disk (VLAD) [Saetta, 2020] uses the given blade loading (which is fixed for the entire duration of the simulation) to impose axial and tangential jumps at the interface. Propeller loading depends on many different parameters and is affected by the surrounding structures and angle of attack (AoA). A method that updates the blade loading at run time is required to take care of the interactions and installation effects. . In the present approach, the Blade Element Method (BEM) is used to calculate the pressure jump and swirl distributions across the propeller disc and is coupled to the SU2 solver. The blade loading and changes to the flow-field are calculated recursively. Propeller geometry details, airfoil characteristics, propeller speed and set blade angle are required as inputs. Using the thrust and power along the blade from BEM, and following the procedure of VLAD, axial and tangential velocities are imposed at the interface. BEM method is verified against the experimental results [Veldhuis, 2005] and found to be performing well. ## Related Work. This work was presented at; SU2 Conference 2022, 5--7 Sept 2022,; Propeller blade load calculation for actuator disk using blade element method.; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otM_Lz2MV4U. and published in; International Journal of Aeronautical and Space Sciences; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42405-023-00593-5.

Deployability,"First of all, thanks @bmunguia for picking this up.. I ran out of time when we were wrapping up v7, so the approach to check for stalling residuals within the CFL adaption routine was half-baked at best. It can definitely be improved (I'm not happy that I left some magic numbers hard-coded in there!). The implementation that is there to check for stall was very loosely based on the type of check we use for computing the Cauchy criteria (accumulated residual changes over time), but we should consider different approaches altogether. Btw, the original CFL adaption routine used something close to Switched Evolution Relaxation, while the new strategy is Exponential Progression with Under-relaxation (see ""A Robust Adaptive Solution Strategy for High-Order Implicit CFD Solvers,"" AIAA 2011-3696 for a short description of both). As you also guessed, I had wanted to experiment with separate CFL numbers for flow and turbulence but also did not get to it. In the end, as @pcarruscag says, this is a very empirical task. It will be difficult to nail down a perfect configuration for all problems, but we might be able to come up with some best practices for choosing tunable parameters if folks have the time to run a lot of numerical experiments for a range of cases to see what works best.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720:1067,configurat,configuration,1067,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"For SU2_DOT_AD the mesh deformation is differentiated manually, this is easy to do because it is a linear operation and the stiffness matrix does not depend on the design variables.

For clarity the FD mode of SU2_DOT is for use with the continuous adjoint only, for which the sensitivities at the surface already include the projection. 3. Not entirely sure if I understood. I think the interpretation of the boundary displacement sensitivities depends on how you initialize the adjoints. Formally what you should get is the product of the Jacobian transpose with the vector of adjoints you initialize. Those surface sensitivities are different from the ones in the file because they include the volume projection, whereas the ones in the file do not (they are the sensitivity wrt the surface nodes, but not considering that moving surface nodes also moves interior nodes).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1017#issuecomment-639520678:526,continuous,continuous,526,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1017#issuecomment-639520678,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"Harichand, Giulio, Edwin, and all,. I would definitely prefer to use either (a) an open source library that is actively maintained, or (b) our own tree-based search. I do think that this is important for the various reasons that have been outlined/discussed already. The method Harichand describes is pretty much what we did in the ASC program. Edwin can provide more details (and we had an AIAA paper around 2005 on this topic). My suggestion: if Edwin has a tree search in C++ already and someone is willing to spend the time to integrated it, that would be the best option. We get the performance that is needed with a lightweight tree search, without external dependencies (to libraries that may provide a lot of other functionality we do not need), and we can expand to parallel trees as needed. If there is no code already available, then PCL seems like a good alternative (since it seems one can compile only portions of the library). Any takers?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 8, 2016, at 4:35 AM, Harichand M V <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. All,. Thanks for your comments. I think ANNlibrary is no longer maintained. It would be better if we can use a well maintained library in-order to prevent issues in future. Additionally ANNlibrary does not support distributed trees. As far as I know, pointcloud library also does not support distributed trees. I guess we will have to write a wrapper routine using MPI. This will create a local tree for its own portion of the surface mesh. Now distance computation can be done by querying all the trees and using the minimum. One catch here is that we will have to compute distance queries in a group in order to prevent the communication latency eating up the advantage.

Deployability,"Hello @aditya12398 ,. The fifth line of the file you attached shows a call to `c++`, rather than `mpicxx`, which could cause those undefined references.

Having both OpenMPI and MPICH installed on your system is complicating things, I think.

Deployability,"Hello SU2 developers,. I am reopening this topic because I am studying a case of jet impingement on a wall with a time-varying flow at the inlet. I have used compressible RANS and TOTAL_CONDITIONS as inlet BC. Specifically, I have set a time-varying stagnation pressure at inlet. To do this, I used the Python script mentioned in the previous messages, modifying some commands to suit my problem. I should mention that I do not use Python frequently, so there are likely some errors. Indeed, I checked the documentation and noticed that the command I used to vary the pressure at the inlet (SetMarkerCustomPtotal) is not listed. However, when I run the simulation, it seems to work quite well. Unfortunately, when examining the pressure field, it appears that the time-varying boundary conditions are applied on the walls with no-slip conditions (represented by the MARKER_ISOTHERMAL command) and not at the inlet as I want. Could you please tell me what changes I need to make in the Python script to correctly set up the problem?

Deployability,"Hello SU2 users and developers,. Begin this year I noticed that the dv_value of an incompressible optimization case is not adjusted by the SLSQP optimizer, but is just halving for each function call. I executed th; e following test cases, to narrow the possibilities and to possibly detect the problem. . First I took a compressible test case to see the deformation behavior of a compressible case; the behavior was as suspected. ; The next step is the change of regime type: compressible to incompressible, which results into a wrong behavior of the dv_value (halving for each function call). ; Subsequently I changed the regime from incompressible to compressible and I changed only the velocity (not the Reynolds number) from Mach 0.7-> 0.07; dv_value worked as suspected. ; As last I ran the compressible case with Mach 0.07 and I changed Reynolds from 6.5e6 -> 1.6e6, which results in a wrong behavior (halving for each function call). It seems to be a bug, because it is an unsuspected behavior and I do not see any relation between the regime type and the adjoint equations. I tried to find it in the code for weeks, however I could not find it. Can someone please tell me why the optimization process behaves in this way for incompressible flows. . I saw many updates of SU2 to the adjoint scripts and to shape_optimization.py. Now I am wondering whether this behavior has been taken into account during the update. So whether the incompressible optimizer will work properly after I have updated the SU2 package. I really look forward to a solution or reply!. Kind regards,.

Deployability,"Hello everyone,. I am starting to work on adding inlet file interpolation capabilities in SU2. I currently have a spanwise PT and TT distribution (r vs PT or TT) for an inlet boundary for a Stator (periodic, turbomachinery case). I want to carry out a spanwise interpolation at the inlet vertices. I can write a program to read an inlet file for a new format (r vs PT or TT). Then I want to 1D interpolate this data against the radii of all the vertices on the inlet face. The best way is to generate a **piecewise 1D interpolation function** that can return the value of the interpolated data at that radius. I have done this before in python using 'interp1D'. I have found the following library for C++ that does have this capability:. http://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/cpp_src/pwl_interp_1d/pwl_interp_1d.html. which will require _'The PWL_INTERP_1D test code needs the R8LIB and TEST_INTERP libraries._'. I hope these libraries will be integrated with SU2 without any issue. However, it would be better if I can use some of the built-in interpolation capabilities in SU2 like what I found in 'interpolation_structure.cpp'. I also look forward to extending this capability for 2D interpolation(that is, in r and theta). It would be very helpful if someone who has worked with interpolation before can point to a function that is capable of generating a piecewise interpolation function that could work for my case or can pitch in any idea related to this.

Goder and Mark D. Maughmer ([10.2514/1.J052905](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J052905)). This model incorporates a new transport equation to describe the growth of the maximum Tollmien-Schlichting instability amplitude in the presence of a boundary layer.; ; ## Related Work; This work will be set-up in the same way as the LM model is in https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1751 (which was also generally speaking how I had set up my own LM transition implementation) to make sure merging in a later stage will be easier. ## Roadmap; I am hoping to achieve a working implementation of the eN transition method. This work will be done as finishing part of my master thesis. We will have to see if I have time to completely finish the V&V phase due to time restrictions. I have already done quite some work on implementing and verifying the LM method on a private branch and results show mixed results, especially at higher Re numbers (mentioned also by Menter et all.).

Deployability,"Hello,. I have been using SU2 NEMO to run cases for steady, inviscid, hypersonic flow around blunt objects. Previously I have been able to successfully run cases using SU2 version 7.1.1. However, I have been running into residual stalling with the newer versions (7.4.1 and 7.5.1).

The existing Poisson solver used a FEM based discretization but we needed a FVM based discretization to maintain numerical consistency when the momentum equations and Poisson equation for pressure are coupled.

I used a pseudo-time approach and Euler explicit and implicit schemes fortime integration. The source term and the boundary conditions (Dirichlet and Neumann) are all hard coded for now.

But now with this 100* modification, the users must enter 0.03, is that correct? . If it is correct, then transition test case/tutorial config files should be updated as well. Because the transition onset correlations (Menter or Abu-Ghannam) uses the percent value. .

Deployability,"Here's my best guess at what is happening: we are not correctly identifying the complete set of neighbors along intersections of two or more periodic boundaries (maybe duplicates, or maybe missing some neighbors). Without the correct stencil, GG will be incorrect due to integrating over the wrong control volume (repeated faces or missing faces). It also needs the correct volume for division in the GG evaluation. LSQ gets away with it most likely because the stencil can be defined independently of the actual set of neighbors (doesn't need to be a closed control volume) - if you miss a neighbor or duplicate a neighbor, you should end up with a similar answer. WLSQ may also get away with it, but with the weighting by inverse distance of the neighbor, you could still see some artifacts in the solution with missing/duplicate neighbors. If you have some time, can you take a look at the periodic matching routines and periodic communication preprocessing? The routines are sort of nasty, since the identification is not so straightforward in a vertex-based code with the DoFs on the boundary, but I expect we are missing something there still with intersecting periodic boundaries.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1090#issuecomment-727639514:271,integrat,integrating,271,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1090#issuecomment-727639514,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Deployability,"Hey everyone, . Following the discussions at the SU2 Developers meeting this week, I wanted to start a conversation about compiling a comprehensive set of V&V cases for SU2 that can showcase it's performance in comparison to other solvers. . I think the the [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/index.html) is a good model to base it on. The idea would be to present the V&V case, provide working configuration and mesh files, and provide results comparing performance to other solvers and to higher fidelity data (when available). This allows people to see the performance of SU2 and replicate it, if need be. . The first step would be compiling a list of cases that should be covered. The [SU2 2014 SciTech paper](https://su2code.github.io/documents/SU2_AIAA_SciTech2014.pdf) would be a good starting point as it already had a couple of validation cases. This list can be bolstered with some of the NASA TMR cases, and with grid convergence studies. I would like to propose an initial list that the community can talk through and make changes as we see fit. I am mostly only familiar with canonical CFD flows that are used in these cases. But it would be great to have other cases, such as Turbo-machinary or FSI cases, that show the full breadth of SU2's abilities. This is by no means an exhaustive list:. 1. Zero Gradient Flat Plate; 2. 2D and 3D Bump in Channel; 3. Asymmetric Diffuser; 4. Backward facing step; 5. Unsteady Square cylinder; 6. NACA0012; 7. NACA4412 Trailing Edge Seperation; 8. Joukowski Airfoil; 9. 30P30N High Lift airfoil; 10. ONERAM6 Wing; 11. NASA CRM; 12. Subsonic and Supersonic Jets. It would be ideal for these test cases to have either high-fidelity data (wind tunnel tests, or LES/DNS data), and/or published results of other solvers so that comparisons can be made. . I also want to point out the difference between this and the TestCases repository. The TestCases repo is used in regression tests to ensure that parts of the code don't break when cha",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/581:412,configurat,configuration,412,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/581,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

This is an ***automated PR*** to migrate recent [DEP](https://github.com/apps/dep) App users to a new [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) called [Dependent Issues]( https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependent-issues). . If you received this PR it means you have DEP installed on the organization level (not necessarily enabled on this repository). If you think this is a mistake, I'm sorry. Please close this PR. ### :newspaper: TLDR. * The current DEP app has _been deprecated in favor of the new [Dependent Issues](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependent-issues)_ Github Action and it will be removed soon.; * The new Action works the same way the bot did but with additional features/changes:; - Works with both _PRs and issues_ (disabled by default).; - Works with _cross-repository_ dependencies e.g. `microsoft/vscode#999`.; - It _notifies users by writing a comment_ with the list of dependencies and keep their states updated. This is especially useful when having the action enabled for non-PR issues.; - Keywords and the label _can now be customized._; - It sets the state of the head commit on a PR _to `pending` instead of `failure`_ (shows as :orange_circle: instead of a :x: ) when some dependencies are not yet ready (i.e. closed).

Deployability,"Hi -. I'm at the AIAA meeting this week and downloaded SU2 after listening to few talks. I noticed you guys optionally link to tecio, the templet binary API, when it is available. . I'm the project manager of the libMesh finite element library, a general purpose C++ finite element library (http://libmesh.sourceforge.net). I also work at NASA/JSC in the Aerosciences & CFD group, hence the potential interest in SU2. In libMesh, we build a number of optional software dependencies from source - Metis, ParMetis, tecio, etc… We find this much preferable to requiring (simple) dependencies to be preinstalled by the user. This pull request adds the source files for tecio, along with automake integration, so that the Tecplot dependencies can be satisfied internally to SU2. The Tecplot tecio source is distributed openly at http://www.tecplot.com/downloads/tecio-library, so there are no issues with redistribution. Some notes on the implementation:; 1. It includes all the tecio sources,; 2. It includes the configure.ac & Makefile.am changes required. Specifically, I did _not_ update the Makefile.in or configure scripts you have checked in to your master, as my autotools are quite newer and doing so would result in unnecessary diffs. So I ask - do you guys have a requirement on the version of autotools you are using, since you are checking in derived files?. See relevant discussion here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4873065/autotools-and-version-control.

Deployability,"Hi ; > WeightNF.dat: I don't understand what this is for. It is read in CAdjEulerSolver::SetIntBoundary_Jump to calculate derivative, so it is used for adjoint calculation? My understanding is that at least discrete adjoint does not need to calculate derivative. Is it for continuous adjoint?. As far as I see it that function should not be called with the discrete adjoint solver. `CAdjEulerSolver::SetIntBoundary_Jump ` is only called by `CAdjFluidIteration::Preprocess` which should happen during a discrete adjoint run (but as far as i understand you that is not happening currently). All `CAdj<sth>` things are related to the continuous adjoint and `CDiscAdj<sth>` to the discrete adjoint.; Boundary conditions (this one being internal) need to be explicitly derived and set in the continuous adjoint but not in the discrete adjoint so your understanding was going in the right direction.

Deployability,"Hi @economon @rsanfer and @talbring ,. There are no additional warnings generated. In addition to a check of the build history in travis (@rsanfer gave me the hint and checked that too) (not including any AD-build), I compared the stderr-output of this branch 2fd2eb0 with the latest develop ed149f7. I used all the additional compiler flags and enabled mpi, autodiff and direct-diff and ran the build on a single core (i.e. make install 2> error.out 1> output.out). Otherwise (i.e. multiple cores) the order gets mixed up and it is impossible to compare the warning/error output. ; A diff on the ""error.out"" of the two builds showed the files are identical (...like completely identical), although the files have ~18.000 lines. The stdout deviates only in the specified build dirs. For now I checked the box above for this PR.

Deployability,"Hi @pcarruscag and @vdweide thank you very much for your troubleshooting tips and explanation! I think I was confusing 3 different settings - the base compilers (CC and CXX), the wrapped mpi compilers (MPICC and MPICXX), and the MKL pkgconfigpath. I did not realise that after updating my base compilers in my environment that the openmpi `mpicc` and `mpicxx` would automatically pick up the new `gcc` (I thought I'd have to compile new mpi wrappers). . I was able to get SU2 on our HPC compiled and running by doing (after installing the newer `gcc` and `g++` compilers):; ```; module load openmpi/3.0.0_intel2018.2.046 ; CC=$(which mpicc) CXX=$(which mpicxx) ./meson.py build -Denable-autodiff=true -Denable-directdiff=true -Denable-pywrapper=true --prefix=/home/user/programs/su2/SU2-7.0.8 -Dwith-mpi=enabled -Denable-mkl=true -Dcustom-mpi=true; ```. What is strange is that previously, the HPC MKL appeared to be automatically picked up from the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. I wanted to use my own newer local copy but updating this path didn't seem to work, bet setting the `-Dmkl_root` flag fixed that.; i.e.; ```; module load openmpi/3.0.0_intel2018.2.046 ; CC=$(which mpicc) CXX=$(which mpicxx) ./meson.py build -Denable-autodiff=true -Denable-directdiff=true -Denable-pywrapper=true --prefix=/home/user/programs/su2/SU2-7.0.8 -Dwith-mpi=enabled -Denable-mkl=true -Dcustom-mpi=true -Dmkl_root=/home/user/programs/intel/2020_update4/compilers_and_libraries_2020.4.304/linux/mkl; ```; Thanks again for both your help!

Being a voluntary institution, this can not be enforced (and we do not want to enforce). How about trying to be less demanding:; In each validation case there will be a statement about the last version that it was checked with and the responsible contributor.

Deployability,"Hi Antonio, thanks for the review! . Precisely, the point of this PR is to ease generalization of multi-zone, multi-instance problems. For this reason, I am currently working on a branch putting together a CMultizoneDriver, which should be generic enough to accommodate problems involving complex multiphysics. The situation is now that there are a lot of hard-coded constraints, in order for specific features to work. FSI is an example itself; it requires a very strict way of setting up the problem. The same happens with other features such as Multizone HB. While this is ok for showcasing the features, I don't think it's a sustainable approach. For example, if we were to do Turbomachinery FSI, with the current structure it wouldn't be feasible. It would require a ""CTurbomachineryFSIDriver"" class, and more hard coded assumptions. My goal is to get rid of these bottlenecks, by leveraging on the class structure of SU2. Of course, this will require work, but I think it will pay off in the long run. This PR is just a starting point: SU2_DEF, SU2_DOT, etc, will need to be updated accordingly in next stages, together with other changes that are also necessary in the optimization framework and the core code to get rid of a lot of hacks here and there.

Deployability,"Hi David,; Yes, I was able to figure out that and I went ahead in trying to make fsi_computation.py work with this branch. Another error (which may be a bug actually ) occurs when the wrapped function **SetInitialMesh()** is run. This directly involves the core of SU2 as I found out the error is given during the run of the function **CILUPreconditioner** (inside **matrix_structure.cpp**) which, as much I understood, builds the preconditioning matrix for the solution of the linear system at the base of the mesh deforming procedure. . SU2 uses by default **ILU** precoditioner whose relative function (see above) has remarkable differences from the Raven release (I didn't go too much into details). Same error I get if using **Jacobi** preconditioner. ; At contrary, everything seems fine if using **LU_SGS** preconditioner and the fsi_computation.py finally works. Maybe it's the case to point it out to the developers inveloved in this part of the code. About your last point, I'm developing at the moment some FSI features and I very much relied on fsi_computation.py in defining the interface with the SU2 core. I'm trying to keep it updated with the current version of SU2 for reliability reasons; I hope there won't be drastic changes in the python wrapping of the code! :). Thanks for the reply!.

Deployability,"Hi Economon,. I encountered an issue very similar to what Auzbaig reported: the error message ""OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION: invalid option value EntropyGeneration"" during optimization with SU2. (I am using SU2 version 8.0.1 ""Harrier.""). After thoroughly examining the existing Python optimization framework, I found that one of the steps in the optimization chain is generating different config.cfg files, with a focus on DV_VALUE and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION. DV_VALUE controls the geometry deformation;; OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION determines the type of objective/constraints.; Then the framework calls SU2_CFD and SU2_DOT to obtain performance metrics or gradient information.; As you mentioned, ""You might need to run updateHistoryMap.py to register new outputs with Python."" Initially, I thought it meant simply providing a new input for OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION in the Python optimization framework. However, it seems that this may not work at the C++ level. To verify this, I ran $ SU2_CFD your_config.cfg -d and observed all available history outputs. However, I suspect that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION cannot use every history output, meaning that the adjoint solver might not recognize some objective functions. Does this imply that additional modifications in the C++ code are required?. Additionally, I would appreciate more information regarding CUSTOM_OBJFUNC. From TestCases/user_defined_functions/lam_flatplate.cfg, I understand that CUSTOM_OBJFUNC allows combinations of existing OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONs and can also utilize CUSTOM_OUTPUTS. The flexibility of CUSTOM_OUTPUTS seems to enable the construction of various desired variables. However, I am unsure whether using OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION= CUSTOM_OBJFUNC along with CUSTOM_OUTPUTS can entirely replace the need for additional modifications in the C++ code. Since I’m not very proficient in C++, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

Deployability,"Hi Eduardo,. both, 'symmetry plane' and 'symmetry as the slip wall' should work in the code (upon fixing this) and it should be made clear (e.g. in the config_template.cfg) what the BC is suitable for, independent of how it is named in the end. ; The simplest solution is probably the patch I provided together with a short note in the config_template (maybe even a reference to this issue), as both 'options' will work as expected (using the very same code). It will basically 'restore' the behaviour of MARKER_SYM of before the fix in #657. The downside is some more computational cost (in case of a plane) which has to be done for each vertex on the marker. I cant say to which extend this takes more time but I would guess it is not too costly. Depends on the case as well. I can do a little check with your case here. . That's it for the diplomatic part :) (Please take the following with a grain). For me a symmetry has to be a line or plane. To cite Jiri Blazek's book 'Computational Fluid Dynamics'(...) 3rd edition using a screenshot:. ![blazekbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/61662377-9ab05a80-acce-11e9-85bf-5998db204d92.png). The chapter is called 'symmetry plane' which already is kinda biased. But there is no 'slip wall for viscous flow' mentioned to my knowledge. In another book (from Ferziger&Peric, which I only have in german) symmetry is only used in the context of symmetry planes as well. ; To me, symmetry BC's are also linked to visualization using mirroring. And mirroring (as the word is commonly meant) is only possible along planes and its little brother, the straight line. I can be wrong or it might be a question of research background. So how to proceed? Trial by combat might have some unpleasant aftermath for the winner so we might go the democratic way and do a poll :) .

Deployability,"Hi Floris,. Can you clarify whether you are using the continuous or discrete adjoint?. One thing that I am noticing in your results above is the large difference in magnitude between the compressible and incompressible sensitivities on the surface, which could require very different scaling later when that info is sent to the optimizer... . I would recommend running the discrete adjoint to get sensitivities for lift/drag w.r.t. the same set of design variables for both the compressible and incompressible solvers and comparing the result (with a nearly incompressible flow so the conditions are basically the same). This way, you can remove the scaling for optimization that is part of the shape_optimization.py script and focus only on the gradient results first. You could use the discrete_adjoint.py script for this.

Deployability,"Hi Lorena,. Sorry for the delay getting back to you. You are right, and the TestCases repository is starting to be huge, mainly because of the stuff that GitHub generates to track the files. Easy to maintain/access alternatives are very welcome. Some releases ago, the grids were in another place (or lab server) and in Github we only had the config files, unfortunately we checked that for some users it was frustrating to download the config files and then go to another place to download the grids. From our practical point of view, the current setting is ideal to run the regression tests. But we are open to any change that benefits the SU2 users/developers community. . Now, it is very easy to download and modify the TestCases (keep in mind that the options in the config files change frequently) but, the price to pay is a large GitHub repository that it is difficult to download if you don’t have a good internet connection.

Deployability,"Hi Pedro, thanks for looking into this more. I had run into inconsistencies for FSI problems with relaxation which was the reason for the domain specific calls coming into the multizone driver Update function. With the changes I introduced, the velocity at the interface was being transferred correctly with and without relaxation, so I left it there but it is a bit messy. I'll test with the modified calls for the Relaxation as you suggest. I completely agree that if we can simplify the velocity transfer by just using the velocity directly, then we should.

Deployability,"Hi Pedro,. I tried the other solution you suggested. I declared a new private variable inside the solver class, which I assigned as config->cb1_usrdef. I registered this as the AD input. I then set a method inside the solver class which returns this value when called.; In the Numerics class, instead of reading cb1 from Config as I used to, I read it from the Solver class, using the method mentioned above.; Now I couldn't create a Solver object inside numerics_structure.inl, since according to the compilation order the solver class is dependant on the numerics class (Solver_structure.hpp includes numerics_structure.hpp). So the compiler doesn't know about the solver class while inside the numerics.; To work around the compiler error, instead I included the solver header file inside the numerics src files (cpp). I then created the solver objects in the relevant numerics functions and called the method which returns the AD-registered cb1 variable.; This all compiles now, but the AD gradient is still returned as 0. Adding print statements to the functions inside the numerics src files revealed that they are getting a cb1 value of 0, which I assume it's because solver_adjoint_discrete.cpp is called after the numerics src files have read the value of cb1, which at that point would be 0.; Would you agree that it's probably best to update the numerics classes inside the adjoint iteration class for CDiscAdjSolver, similar to what's done inside CDiscAdjFEAIteration? Is this what you meant when you referred to the elasticity solver?.

Deployability,"Hi Pedro,; thanks for cleaning up Joel's code and creating the pull request. The disc_adj_fsi testcase is failing, I believe because of the relaxation. Probably you need to update the value of the test_case config and set the relaxation to 1.0 to recover the previous test. ; About the symmetric matrix class: Joel's implementation was indeed intended to populate the matrix needed for the RBF; the CSysMatrix would not be able to accommodate some terms due to the sparsity. It's well explained in the comments. Also, his implementation was only single-core. I agree that it would be very interesting to have some methods such as the cholesky decomposition available, but I think they would require some reworking (at least for parallelization).; I think this is a very valuable contribution, so it would be good to get more people on board to push it forward.; Cheers,; Ruben",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/555#issuecomment-406847760:173,update,update,173,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/555#issuecomment-406847760,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Hi Ruben, no worries. Integrating on the fluid side is what makes sense for matching meshes, less hassle given the availability of dual grid information, no need for MPI boiler plate, etc. The adjoint implications are being accounted for, this integration step is being recorded and overall the dependencies have not changed, the fluid nodes are still the ones defining the direction of the stress.; As you can see from the files I attached, the sensitivities are very similar for conservative/consistent interpolation cases. . It is not possible to generalise this for conservative interpolation (i.e. using the transpose of the displacement interpolation matrix to interpolate tractions) because that approach implicitly takes care of the (possible) different areas associated with fluid and solid nodes. If you transfer stresses with conservative interpolation and then integrate you get the wrong force. The conservative approach requires forces to be transferred, otherwise we start taking liberties with the meaning of the word :).

I would propose that all of you go through your feature branches and collect the following information about them:. - Branch name; - A two line description on the goal of the branch; - Status of the branch:; - Under active development (we are adding a new feature here); - Complete feature, (not necessarily up-to-date with develop); - In such case, latest compatible release; - Mature feature (not necessarily complete); - Test feature, still under consideration; - Test feature, discontinued; - Old feature / unknown status; - Can the branch be deleted?. This information would be very valuable, as maybe some people would be interested in continuing old developments, some repetitive work would also be avoided, and collaboration between complementary branches would be enhanced. I'm happy to help in collecting this information and later cleaning up the repository. Please let me know of your thoughts, but I think we should get this started asap.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/582:745,release,release,745,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/582,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi all,. I experimented a little bit with a different build system to replace automake/autotools. Although it works most of the time fine, it is cumbersome to work with. Especially when modifying the .am files and the configure.ac due to the complicated syntax. Furthermore it is relatively slow. One alternative would be cmake, however, the syntax is also not very comfortable and it has too many features which we actually don't need. . So I came across meson and ninja. It is lightweight and very easy to use (setting it up for SU2 took half a day, without any prior knowledge). Compilation time is faster because it builds all object files in parallel. Another advantage is that it is platform independent. Creating packages and binaries and also crafting releases is much simpler with this system (which we can exploit to automate the release process). It is also possible to embed our regression test framework into that process. . In case you want to try it out, checkout the branch **meson_build**. Everything needed is added as submodule (meson and ninja), so make sure to do a `git submodule update` to clone them. To configure and build use the following commands:. `externals/meson/meson.py build`; `./ninja -C build`. Please test it and give feedback. I have not tried it on windows or mac, so if you are using any of these OS, give it a try!. Note: automake and meson can co-exist together without any interference.

Deployability,"Hi all,. I'm new to CFD and SU2. I'm trying to modify the c++ code to add a time-dependent mach in the compressible Euler equations (SU2 Solver: EULER) for a rocket head cone design. At about line 786 of the CEulerSolver.cpp, I want to have a slight numerical change in its mach, for example, a sine function. After I saw the example of the Adding Custom Source Terms to Euler Equations I modified the code like this:. ```; const auto dt = config->GetDelta_UnstTimeND();; su2double time = config->GetTime_Step() * dt;; su2double Alpha = config->GetAoA()*PI_NUMBER/180.0;; su2double Beta = config->GetAoS()*PI_NUMBER/180.0;; const su2double MachValue = config->GetMach();; su2double Mach = 2 * MachValue + 0.01 * sin(2 * PI_NUMBER * time);; ```.

Deployability,"Hi all,. This is definitely good discussion... everything goes toward multi-physics nowadays, so we should always be improving the class design accordingly. I suppose this will just get more important with adding more physics, zones, and more complex time integration schemes. I would like to highlight that when the code was first released, we did not have ""zones"" at all (not until some early sliding mesh work after a couple of versions), and the CDriver and CIteration classes didn't even exist until we dreamed them up a couple of years ago. My point is that, with some proper planning, we have the creativity and the right team to develop the solution we need, and we shouldn't be afraid to make big changes when necessary. Moving quickly while leveraging the team's broad skillset is one of our biggest advantages in this project. As you all know, over the years, we continue to move toward a *_structure.cpp and *_physics.cpp mindset for how we do our abstractions/data encapsulations, with ""structure"" components reused and ""physics"" components being specialized to a certain set of governing equations. This has happened in many places, including recently with the CTransfer class, for instance, and it is likely to happen with the COutput class(es) before long. However, one area where there hasn't been much evolution is within the CIntegration classes. Apart from a couple of additions for structural problems and now the DG integration, it is largely the same as it was in the first release. Perhaps this is our opportunity to rethink and update these classes for future expansion, just as we've done for others over the years. We could rework them, move them up or down in the hierarchy, change where they're instantiated, change the inheritance, and so on. Even if they get a little more complicated (like usual), as long as they're properly abstracted, it isn't likely to bother the developers working in other areas of the code too much. In short, I think some effort spent on the CI",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-329078585:256,integrat,integration,256,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-329078585,2,"['integrat', 'release']","['integration', 'released']"

Deployability,"Hi all,; really interesting topic going on here. As @pcarruscag just very well explained, and after quite some time working on the code, I can totally see the need for dense algebra. . I agree with @juanjosealonso and @erangit that maintaining the code portable and very easy to install should be a must. It has been a signature of SU2 since the beginning and we should continue on that line. I've had some problems before with codes that rely heavily on PETSc, so I wouldn't particularly be keen to go down that road. . **Eigen** would be really easy to integrate in SU2: they have a mirror on GitHub here: [Eigen Github repo](https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror) which could be easily added as a submodule in the same way as CoDiPack or MeDiPack. Given that they are only header files, there would be no need to compile any external library. And there is another very important point made by @vdweide and @pcarruscag: we need to ensure compatibility with the discrete adjoint functionality. One huge advantage of Eigen is that is fully templated: we recently differentiated a code that was heavy reliant on Eigen in an afternoon, and it worked great. While LAPACK is indeed a very mature library, I believe that it would require using external functions for every functionality, which would be a really big burden. @talbring @MaxSagebaum could add some more hints in this discussion.

The dummy wing has a double planform defined as:; - semi span = [5; 10]; - taper = [0.55; 0.35]; - dihedral angle = [5°; 2.5°]; - twist angle = [1°; 0°; -1°] (given for root, kink and tip airfoil sections); - sweep angle at LE = 25°; - Aspect ratio = 11.8; - semi area = 38. I defined the reference length as:; - reference (semi) area = 45; - reference chord = 3; - reference (semi) span = 15. The flight conditions remained unchanged:; - Mach number: 0.78; - Temperature = ~217 K; - Reynolds number: ~19 millions; - AoA = 0°. I created the exact same grid as before (same number of cells, same progression), ensuring my first cell was at y+<1. Things is, this time, SU2 did not have any trouble converging and computed the right z-projected area... I checked the results with another software and the pressure distribution (taken along the chord near the kink) match, see attached Figure. I am attaching the dummy configuration file (dum.txt) as well as the mesh (dum_mesh.txt) if it can be of interest to you. The mesh is a .geo gmsh file. To get the mesh, simply open with gmsh and click mesh 3D (or, from the console: gmsh dum_mesh.txt -3). At this point, I think that my problem might be related to the actual wing airfoil geometry, which is somehow not well pre-processed by SU2... I will continue investigating and keep you posted if I find a solution.

Deployability,"Hi there,. maybe I should mention that as a part of my commits to integrate a CHT functionality to SU2 (see the pull request I opened up a month ago, if you like), I also had to implement a heat solver that can be coupled to a flow equation system. We even chose similar namings (mine is called CHeatSolverFVM). It might be interesting for you that it also can be run ""stand-alone"" for pure heat conduction problems (for solids..) in which case it is nothing else but a Poisson solver.; It's just that my naming is unnecessarily specific, I should rather rename the CHeatSolverFVM to CAdvectionDiffusionSolver and generalize the coefficients (""diffusivity"" instead of ""thermal_difffusivity"", for example). Sounds to be a good idea... :D. Anyway, feel informed :-).

Deployability,"Hi!. I tried the [Quick Start] tutorial. [Quick Start]: <https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Quick-Start/>. I built SU2 from source (from commit 3f68501a7ccb107f05a44c2aa5747797541fb683 , branch 'develop').; I took files 'mesh_NACA0012_inv.su2' and 'inv_NACA0012.cfg' from the same commit. I managed to obtain a correct solution for the DIRECT problem (pressure field visualized with ParaView from 'flow.vtu' looks reasonably similar to the image shown in the tutorial).; Afterward, I changed the parameter MATH_PROBLEM from DIRECT to CONTINUOUS_ADJOINT in the configuration file and:. $ ln -s restart_flow.dat solution_flow.dat; $ SU2_CFD inv_adj_NACA0012.cfg. I obtained a correct adjoint solution (density adjoint field visualized with ParaView from 'adjoint.vtu' looks reasonably similar to the image shown in the tutorial). Finally, I wanted to also try the algorithmic differentiation, so I changed the parameter MATH_PROBLEM to DISCRETE_ADJOINT in the configuration file and:. $ SU2_CFD_AD inv_dadj_NACA0012.cfg. I failed to obtain a correct adjoint solution (I expected to see something really similar to what I got with the CONTINUOUS_ADJOINT method): the density adjoint field seems to have a completely different scale (instead of having values in the approximate range -200 ÷ +200, it has values in the range -0.264 ÷ +0.217 and the values not too close to zero are concentrated in an area near the farfield boundary, far from the airfoil).

Deployability,"Hi, @cjz667. When I tried lid driven cavity case with default setting and switching ROE to AUSMPLUSUP, I got the following error - Error in “void CSyssolve::ModGramSchmidt(int.........; SU2 has diverged (It ran for 2 iterations). Reduced the CFL to 0.5 (originally 2.0), it runs fine.; But it is going to take more number of iterations.; This issue was noted earlier as well and reason behind that is inconsistent Jacobian (Roe here) with AUSM family of schemes. This restricts the allowable CFL number to a lower values for these scehemes. For low speed flows u may have to use smaller value of CFL with these two schemes. . Dr. Padro (pcarruscage) has done some work in this direction and implemented hybrid Jacobian for some of these schemes (available in develop branch) , which improves this situation and u can try higher CFL. I have also worked out analytical Jacobian and will be pushing in future release. I hope you can go with reasonable CFL for majority of the other cases, where Mach number is not too small.; I have added one Testcase for high speed flow past blunt body in testcase folder /euler/bluntbody, which uses AUSMPLUSUP.

Deployability,"Hi, I've seen this with some (one) cgns file but not others (larger ones), for example I never had any issue with the finest HL-CRM reference grids on nodes with 128 cores.; I suspect this has something to do with how the files are generated, but I did not investigate further. I think the HL-CRM are made by Pointwise but I do not know the export settings used, do let us know if you find a solution.; Regarding the ASCII format, we have recently improved the mesh reader (in the develop branch), if you are generating the file yourself, and if you list the ""points"" before the ""elements"" in the file, it may be up to 4 times faster to read it.; Finally, the file systems used in the clusters of some very fine institutions are absolute trash (not saying this is your case, just making you aware of the fact), and they respond very badly to having many cores reading the same file. Especially for ASCII because here all cores read the entire file, and not just some sections.; If you run the hybrid parallel version of SU2 this will be less of a problem because fewer cores will be participating in file-IO (but all of them will still be used for computation).; https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/#basic-configuration; https://su2foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gomes.pdf; Cheers,; Pedro",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1378#issuecomment-924779452:1226,configurat,configuration,1226,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1378#issuecomment-924779452,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"Hi, thanks for this interesting discussion. Just a reminder... there is a third place where the default values are stored! the config_template.cfg file. I have had similar problems to what @erangit is describing with the multiple definition of the default values in different places, in fact, sometimes is not clear what is the minimum number of parameters that you can use in a config file. I think that the ideal scenario would be to use the config_template.cfg file as the default value keeper and create subroutines in C++ and python that update the defaults with the existing information in that file. Remember that config_template.cfg is always required otherwise the user doesn't know that are the existing options. By the way... this discussion reminds me that we should update SetRunTime_Options(void). This is an incredible useful small subroutine to modify the software parameters during runtime.

My suggestion is to create the following parameter:; % Residual convergence criteria equation (RHO, RHO_VEL, RHO_ENERGY); RESIDUAL_FUNC_FLOW= RHO. In other words, why don't you create an equivalent to CAUCHY_FUNC_FLOW? (but for the residual convergence criteria).

Deployability,"Hi,. The structure of fsi_computation.py is completely different from the one of parallel_computation(_fsi).py, this one is just a script that, if I am right, will set for you the commands in order to launch SU2_CFD in parallel and SU2_SOL right after. It is based on system calls ( it is like calling mpirun -np xx SU2_CFD SU2conf.cfg and mpirun -np xx SU2_SOL SU2conf.cfg). The fsi_computation.py has to be considered as an executable, and thus has to be launched with the mpirun command for parallel run:. $ mpirun -np XX fsi_computation.py -f FSIConfig.cfg --parallel. You have to specify the FSI configuration file (see examples in TestCase) with -f, and the --parallel option is mandatory (only if SU2 has been built in parallel). XX is the number of procs.

Deployability,"Hi,. Unfortunately the logic is quite confuse but I think that part of the code is correct, SU2 just want to use an updated version of the limiter for the turbulence variables. ` if (config->GetSpatialOrder() == SECOND_ORDER_LIMITER) SetSolution_Limiter(geometry, config);; `; and for the flow variables. ` if (limiter_flow) solver_container[FLOW_SOL]->SetPrimitive_Limiter(geometry, config);; `. Another story is if that is really worth it and we should use the values from the previous iteration. Remember that we compute the turbulence variables after updating the flow variables... so... from the theoretical point of view it makes sense to have an updated value for the limiter. However this is not 100% accurate because we are using old gradients to compute the new limiter. Anyway, the spirit is to have a limiter computed using the latest flow variables value and we should probably check that the gradients have been also updated before computing limiters again for the turbulence equation. What I don't really like is Upwind_Residual. ` bool limiter = (config->GetSpatialOrder() == SECOND_ORDER_LIMITER);; `. in this case we are using only the info about limiters or not in the turbulence model... so if, for example, we are using JST for the mean flow equations then the limiter for the flow equations have never been computed and. ```; if (limiter) {; FlowPrimVar_i[iVar] = V_i[iVar] + Limiter_i[iVar]*Project_Grad_i;; FlowPrimVar_j[iVar] = V_j[iVar] + Limiter_j[iVar]*Project_Grad_j;; }. ``` . Is incorrect because Limiter_i has never been computed (if we are lucky maybe we are using a zero value by default... but we need to check). In other words, I think this require a deeper look. @jschuele, could you please think on this and submit a new pull request (I'll close this one). If you don't have time, please let me know and we really appreciate if you could add this situation as an Issue. We'll try to fix this problem as soon as possible.

The solutions rapidly diverge when I use FAN_FACE_MACH, but they converge if I use FAN_FACE_PRESSURE and set the pressure to a reasonable value. Looking at the source code, I believe this cause by not reevaluating the marker's Mach Number. . Looking at the source code, I would suggest adding the following line of code to CEulerSolver.cpp after line 2932 which is where it seems to update other marker parameters. config->SetInflow_Mach(iMarker_Inlet, Inlet_Mach_Total[iMarker_Inlet]);",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2274:550,update,update,550,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2274,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Hi,. this is just a small chore which cleans LoadRestart routines and strengthens the similarities between the function. Declare vars where needed (instead of the top of the func), make things const and some anticipation of clang-format stuff (without explicitly running it over that file); This was originally done in #1388 but i dont want to pollute that PR with unrelated stuff. I also added a `nVarTurb` Variable which can be accessed via the Config. Might be handy in some places, instead of always going through the full enum class TURB_MODEL. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

Deployability,"Hi. While attempting to run compressible N-S simulation using Peng-Robinsion EoS, I ran into a problem with non-physical solutions. Running SU2_CFD gives the following error multiple times and exits:. ------------------------------ Begin Solver -----------------------------; not physical solution found, h and s input -1.24974 -3.8387; ...; !!! Error: SU2 has diverged. Now exiting... !!! . The simulation which resulted in the error was run at around 313 K and 400 bar, which is in the critical region of the fluid I used (CO2). Repeating the simulation at lower pressures (less than about 100 bar) seems to work fine. In the critical region the EoS has only one real solution, so perhaps the problem is related to finding a root for the EoS in fluid_model_ppr.cpp. Has anyone else encountered the problem?.

For blas I used `-Dblas-name=blas` as an extra argument passed to meson. Mind you, I didn't use the `meson.py` script or `./ninja` but instead used the preinstalled versions on my system. I had also cloned the `fix_python_3.8` branch instead of master so there are quite some changes I had to do to successfully build it. I also noticed that openblas uses ~17 MBs extra install space, which I think is because of additional optimizations over the standard preinstalled blas package (just a speculation).

The effect of COMBINE_OBJECTIVE is a flag to switch between treating the objectives separately (each objective and its gradient is evaluated separately and the python scripts loop sequentially over the objectives, or if this option is 'YES' then a 'COMBO' value is output to the history file and the gradient is computed all-at-once (I can explain that more offline if necessary)). At the moment this only works for linear combinations of existing objectives, so the sample objective Francisco listed would be beyond that. .

Deployability,"I came across this when I was working on a mesh generation program that generates an extruded boundary layer. I had checks in the program to make sure I was generating elements of positive volume and that they weren't self intersecting. While some of the elements were very badly skewed, I knew I didn't want the elements to be reoriented. However, SU2 reorients several of the prisms and tries to reorient some of the pyramids as well (which isn't a defined operation in SU2). . This is why in my particular case it was easier for me to just turn off the feature. . In general though, I think that the reorientation check could be a bit better. Currently for the prism element for example, it does a volume like calculation using the top and bottom triangles separately, and reorients if either one is negative. Obviously if only one of these calculations is negative, by reorienting, the other calculation would become negative. Similar things are done for pyramids and hexas. . A simple solution would be to change the ""or"" conditions in these calculations to ""and"", so that it is only reoriented if it fails all the checks. I think a better solution would be to decide on a volume calculation method for each element type, and then use that as a criteria. . If you'd prefer to just improve the reorientation checks instead of adding this configuration option, I could submit work on a pull request for that if you'd like.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/162#issuecomment-103679295:1342,configurat,configuration,1342,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/162#issuecomment-103679295,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"I did a couple of changes to the discrete adjoint implementation. Despite the necessary changes in the iteration structure, the following things have been changed/added:; - It is now possible to compute Pressure, Mach and AoA sensitivities (similar to the continuous adjoint), along with this I modified the screen output.; - The computation of the geometry sensitivities is now split from the adjoint iteration itself (this saves a lot of memory and is much faster). However, this also means that geometry sensitivities are only updated just before the solution files are written.; - In some places in the code you may find the macro AD_BEGIN_PASSIVE and AD_END_PASSIVE. Everything in between is not recorded (called passive section). This is currently used for sections that are related to the construction of the flow Jacobian, since we assume that this Matrix does not depend on the flow solution, i.e. is constant. This is of course not true and leads to a very small error (~0.05% for a flow residual of 10^-4) in the sensitivities, but also increases performance a lot. Then there is a small change in solver_direct_mean.cpp:; - I moved the computation of the primitive variables in the Preprocessing routine into a separate routine (SetPrimitive_Variables). This way it is easier and there is less overhead when computing the coupling of the flow and turbulent variables needed in the discrete adjoint solver.

Deployability,"I do not know if it exists already and /or if it is planned at all. In the case it does not exist it would be good to have output information on global energy balances at hand. This specifically applies to CHT multizone computations, but not only. **Describe the solution you'd like**; The energy balance should take care about delta enthalpy between inlet(s) and outlet(s). That can be compared to the heat transferred across the wall(s). So in a steady simulation with one inlet, one outlet and a wall the balance global balance should be zero. When working e.g. on a heat exchanger designs could also be compared with respect to their performance (e.g. NTU numbers or similar). This could be specifically interesting for multizone examples. Further that should work for steady, unsteady, open/closed domains and also consider technical work (as in the case of turbomachinery). ; Essentially it is an output request that should reflect the first law of thermodynamics (including open, transient systems and technical work).; It would help in engineering assessment, convergence control and be a check when new features are implemented. **Example**.

Deployability,"I haven't explicitly checked if they match but for the rigid motion cases the grid velocity is calculated from the transformation matrices and then imposed to update the grid. Therefore if the grid velocities are back calculated from the grid using FD then I would expect them to be close but not exact. For a pitching airfoil case with FFD design variables, the average difference in gradients for an objective function of L/D was within 1% between discrete adjoint and finite differences. This is very similar for both imposed grid velocities in the adjoint preprocessing and with the FD calculation for the grid velocities. So I think the results are pretty reliable for the rigid motion cases using the updated grid velocities calculation. . The deforming grid on the other hand is a different story.

It doesn't create elements of the best quality but I made sure that they had a positive volume. SU2 would then reorient some elements on me, which caused even more issues for the meshes I created . .

This approach is very similar to Boost's setup. Google Test does not offer a header-only version. Additionally, the developer plans to drop C++11 support, and move to C++14. A simpler branch will still support C++03. It's not clear which features are supported in the C++03 variant, and which ones aren't.

The problem stems from the version of cstdlib (or stdlib.h) and the c++ (or c) standard that is specified. alligned_alloc was not introduced in c++11, it was introduced in c11, and didn't make it into the c++ standard until c++17. My understanding is that basically, if stdlib.h is used, and the c (not c++) standard is set to 2011 or greater, aligned_alloc should appear in the global namespace. If cstdlib is used and the c++ standard is set to 2017 or greater, then aligned_alloc will appear in the std namespace. Also, I believe if the c++ standard is set to 2017 or greater, and stdlib.h is used, aligned_alloc will also appear in the global namespace. However, there were several gcc compiler releases (including up to 7.3) that did not have aligned_alloc as part of the std:: namespace. Apparently, this bug was fixed in gcc 7.4 and up. I was also able to work around this problem by using the allocation_toolbox_PATCH.txt that @pcarruscag provided, above, as well. -Paul",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/955#issuecomment-760580247:261,install,install,261,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/955#issuecomment-760580247,2,"['install', 'release']","['install', 'releases']"

Deployability,"I suggest that we add a test to the regressions that will check the file output format - we already have a routine to diff two files in the python scripts, so this should be fairly straightforward. ; My thought here is that this would include very small cases, with just one iteration and/or just running SU2_SOL, to check that the header format hasn't changed in all the output formats. This is something we don't usually check for, especially in paraview output since most of us don't use that. It'll add some overhead for developers when the output content or format is changed (we'll need to update the reference file in the test cases repo), but since this is something likely to cause inconvenience to users (all of a sudden everyone needs to update their tecplot layout, etc), that's not such a bad thing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/283#issuecomment-225968460:596,update,update,596,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/283#issuecomment-225968460,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"I think the way the prefix is set up is fine. My suggestion is more about where things go under $prefix. For python scripts meant to be used as executables... I'd put these directly under `$prefix/bin`, e.g. on my system, `/usr/bin/foo.py` and be sure that foo.py has execute permission. Python modules meant to be imported ... I'd put these in <somewhere>/python3.x/site-packages or let pip decide where to put them. So `foo.py` could end up in two different places, I guess. Concrete example: I just installed and ended up with:; ```; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/pysu2_nastran.py; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/__init__.py; ```; Instead, a better setup might be:. `/usr/bin/pysu2_nastran.py` (with mode 755). and. ```; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/pysu2_nastran.py; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/__init__.py; ```. Whereby /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages is right for my system, but other systems will have their own place to install modules. That's where I suspect pip might be helpful. Perhaps it could be figured out from sys.path, though not sure how portable that is. This is an easy fix for someone who understands the build/install process well (and that's not me).

Current lines 6100-6104 of geometry_structure.cpp. ```; #ifndef HAVE_MPI; point_line >> Coord_2D[0]; point_line >> Coord_2D[1];; #else; if (size > SINGLE_NODE) { point_line >> Coord_2D[0]; point_line >> Coord_2D[1]; point_line >> LocalIndex; point_line >> GlobalIndex; }; else { point_line >> Coord_2D[0]; point_line >> Coord_2D[1]; LocalIndex = iPoint; GlobalIndex = node_count; }; ```. In serial, the index is completely ignored. In parallel, both are used. Unlike what the documentation says, the node index is completely meaningless in parallel, and there is no documentation of a needed global index in parallel. . I don't know what the correct behavior should be. That is a team decision. I think that the behavior should be roughly the same in serial and parallel. Either the local indices matter, or they don't. If they don't matter, they should be removed. Actually implementing this behavior (in either direction), however, could break a lot of people's code, as in either direction mesh files that were previously working could be different.

Deployability,"I was looking a bit more into this because of the issue with having to treat the structural solver differently in the Update function.; (I gotta say I feel lucky I never had to look into time domain stuff, because 3 nested iterations... not easy). Anyway, I think there is a problem here, the ""predicted displacement"" that is transferred to the fluid during outer iterations (the coupling iterations within each time iteration) is the one set in CFEASolver::SetAitken_Relaxation, which is part of the Corrector step at the end of the structural inner iterations (the ones within each outer iteration). The ""predicted velocity"" is not set in SetAitken_Relaxation thus the grid velocities are lagged by one time step, since they are only set to the current velocity of the structure at the end of the time step (in the Update methods). I have little trust in the predictor step, looking at it I thing only zero order has a chance of working and anything else will cause the fluid and structural sides to separate / overlap, I'll test the theory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-774712415:118,Update,Update,118,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-774712415,2,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"I'll have the summary at the bottom, you guys read papers you know to look for the conclusions.; ## Global speedup (Conclusions); I took the expected speedups for each prototyped area of the code and applied them to the profile I measured for the benchmark case from #716 / #753 (which is not very linear solver intensive).; It is hard to estimate the effect of fusing the convective and viscous edge loops, I assumed the cheaper of the two becomes ""free"" and the other gets a speedup of 1.5 (speedup should be 1.85 accounting for the matrix update optimizations).; I assumed that gradients and limiters are not fused and that minor areas of the code get no speedup, which is not necessarily true as this work would require contiguous storage of geometric properties (geometry->node and geometry->edge) and so some speedup is expected due to that, but in the absence of evidence I prefer to be conservative.; Here are the numbers:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/66394872-15376f00-e9ce-11e9-80ed-193aea2aae6f.png); The take home number is **1.7**. Cumulative with the 1.4 from contiguous storage, so 2.4 total. Despite most of my posts being focused on SIMD my main motivation is the hybrid parallelization which will allow important algorithmic improvements when running on hundreds of cores, namely the multigrid and additive linear preconditioners will retain their effectiveness at much larger core counts.; I will not hazard an estimate for this. ## Proposed changes (Summary); **Hybrid parallel**; - Gradients (GG) and limiters converted to point loops (embarrassing parallel, no edge colouring needed).; - Residual loops parallelized with edge colouring, if anyone has suggestions regarding algorithms send them my way, so far I only tested greedy colouring on edge groups to preserve spatial locality (this aspect is absolutely fundamental).; - Matrix multiplication, BCSR format is also embarrassing parallel.; - Linear preconditioners, additive decomposition wit",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312:542,update,update,542,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"ION_ORIGIN that the pull-up. To simulate a free-flying aircraft (in a flight mechanical sense) which moves and rotates in all six degrees of freedom about the center of gravity, a combination of both translation and rotation is beneficial. In the proposed change, the ROTATING_FRAME now considers both parameters ROTATION_RATE and TRANSLATION_RATE given in the config file. Because the default translation rates are zero, there should be no effect for users who want pure rotation. The option STEADY_TRANSLATION now appears obsolete to me because the functionality is included in the ROTATING_FRAME, but I didn't want to remove the code because someone else might use that parameter? . ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*.

Deployability,"It seems like your situation may have been resolved, but for archival purposes, I'll list my workaround here. This problem occurs when you've installed python packages in two different locations. This could be due to installing some python packages in a system directory (e.g. `/usr/lib/`) and some in a user directory (e.g. `~/.local/`). SU2's build process is set to automatically detect the default package location, but it's not equipped to handle multiple package locations. There are some hardcoded includes, but these only work for python 2.7. I don't consider this a bug *per se* because multiple python package directories is not a standard use case. #### The symptoms. When building SU2 with the python wrapper you'll see the following error during the swig build:; ```; <install directory>/../SU2_PY/pySU2/pySU2.i:64: Error: Unable to find 'mpi4py/mpi4py.i'; ```; But mpi4py is indeed installed on your system and it's on your python path, as confirmed by opening a python terminal and running `import mpi4py`. #### The easiest workaround. Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`.

Deployability,"Juan,. I think that having the flexibility to apply wall functions on only a subset of the viscous wall boundaries would be useful. E.g., if you are interested in a wing, you can apply integration to the wall there, but apply wall functions on the fuselage. My preference would be to have a dedicated BC type for that, i.e. Tom's second suggestion. Apart from this, we can have the different wall model types as a single input parameter, i.e. you apply the same wall model type for all viscous boundaries. Or would you like to have the flexibility to specify this as well per individual marker?.

Deployability,"Juan,. Indeed, it is desirable that at the highest level the details of the time integration scheme and number of zones per discipline should not be visible. The question is whether that is achievable for all combinations you can think of. This is especially the case for the time integration schemes. E.g. suppose you would like to use a multi-stage time integration scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture w",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-328441926:81,integrat,integration,81,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-328441926,5,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"Let me recall the other sub-issues reported by @suargi:. **Third issue**; > After solving the previous issues, with mpirun and depending on the number of cores to be used SU2 will still produce a segmentation fault when using Full MG. This problem is not present when using mpiexec. I traced it back and found that in CFVMFlowSolverBase<V, FlowRegime>::Friction_Forces the method GetNormal_Neighbor() from CVertex returns a non existing point. I was able to partially reproduce this with @suargi's help, by modifying `SU2/TestCases/rans/rae2822/turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`, setting MGLEVEL=6 (instead of 3) and MGCYCLE=FULLMG_CYCLE (instead of W_CYCLE). This could become the new regression test by the way. Both with `mpirun -n 3` and `mpiexec -n 3` we observed non-existing point IDs of the normal neighbor. In #1430 I describe what I think is the problem. For `mpirun -n 2` and `mpiexec -n 2` I get another kind of error, I'll further investigate this. We did not see a difference in behaviour of `mpirun` and `mpiexec` on my system however. **Edit**: My version are `mpirun (Open MPI) 4.1.0` and `mpiexec (OpenRTE) 4.1.0`. **Fourth issue**; > Further, this parameter, Convergence_FullMG, is set to false in CIntegration::CIntegration() and never updated i.e., there is no evaluation whether the FullMG has converged or not.

Deployability,"My fault - I realised that I only specified the CC variable, and not the CXX variable too. For anyone who faces this issue in the future (or myself, if I forget), you'll need to also install both gcc and g++. i.e.:; ```; conda install gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64; ```; Then you can run meson with the following:; ```; CC=/home/user/anaconda3/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-gcc CXX=/home/user/anaconda3/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-g++ ./meson.py build -Denable-pywrapper=true --prefix=/home/user/programs/su2/SU2-7.0.8; ```; That solves the first issue above and the compilation which stalled before now completes.

On the subject of de-swizzling data remember I said the writes into CSysMatrix would be a bit weird, that is because each Jacobian contribution will be a ""matrix of short arrays"" that needs to be transformed into a short array of matrices, the result of that is code like the above that explicitly manipulates the lanes of our SIMD type, such code can be completely hidden inside CSysMatrix which is good because a 4x4 vectorized transpose and matrix update looks like this; ```c++; // block j, subs from jj and goes to ij; T0 = blk_j[ k ].unpackLo(blk_j[k+1]); T1 = blk_j[ k ].unpackHi(blk_j[k+1]);; T2 = blk_j[k+2].unpackLo(blk_j[k+3]); T3 = blk_j[k+2].unpackHi(blk_j[k+3]);.

Deployability,"New code created by Blanca Fuentes Monjas, pushed by Evert Bunschoten for permission reasons. ## Proposed Changes; - Added non-polytropic Peng-Robinson (NPPR_GAS) equation of state (CP temperature dependant model): the specific heat ratio is not constant but a polynomial model (CP = n0 + n1*T + n2*T^2 +n3*T^3 + n4*T^4) can be specified for the specific heat via the input file option (CP_POLYCOEFFS) ; - The NPPR fluid model uses the polytropic Peng-Robinson fluid model as a base class. Therefore, the polytropic Peng-Robinson class now allows for inheritance. ; - New test case (TestCases/nicfd/edge_NPPR) to compare the results of the NPPR with a constant CP model (CP = n0) and the polytropic Peng-Robinson models. The results of both simulations for this test case are equivalent.; . ## Related Work; - The polytropic Peng-Robinson remains functionally unchanged. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"Nice analysis @clarkpede. It is true that we simplify the Jacobians at the periodic boundaries, mostly to avoid issues with adding entries to the Jacobian from the neighbors that potentially do not live on our rank and to keep communication costs low (those neighbors are treated explicitly). This could be changed to communicate the full Jacobian.. but I am not sure it is worth the effort/cost. The approximation that is made should still be consistent though, because we only allow one of the repeated periodic nodes to participate in the linear solve with each nonlinear iteration, and then we communicate its update to its periodic pair. In short, the value of the solution should always be the same on periodic points with each iteration update, and if the problem converges to a steady-state (even in time stepping mode), the Jacobian should only affect convergence (the RHS should be the same). You could try the time stepping option with one of the RK methods to see if going fully explicit helps further isolate the issue. It could also be something related to the time step that is communicated. In the SetTime_Step() routine in the flow solver class, we do some special checks for time stepping mode to make sure that the minimum global time step is used in all cells.

Deployability,"Ok, SIMD update, with #753, #959, and #966 we now have a unified storage type for the data we need in CNumerics. This means that we (I) only need to implement ""SIMD accessor methods"" (i.e. that return a SIMD type instead of a su2double) for one class (C2DContainer and co.). I think to do SIMD right we need a new way of going about CNumerics, these are my design requirements for ""CNewNumerics"":; - Thread-safe (consequently const-correct), a single object must be safe to use by multiple threads.; - Minimal indirection, the polymorphic overhead will be reduced to a single call (ComputeResidual), all auxiliary functions (like the ones that live in CNumerics) will be forcefully inlined, no useless copies of data (no more numerics->SetBlaBla).; - Compile time nDim/nVar, which will: a) avoid heap allocations; b) allow effective loop-unrolling (also during the writes to CSysMatrix).; - Allow low-overhead composition, e.g. have one CRoe for Euler and one CRoeVisc for NS to fuse convective and viscous residuals (without copy pasting code).; - A lot more readable, those cryptic V_i[iDim+1] need to go (somehow...). To achieve all this, the ""CNewNumerics"" will work as a template (obvs) decorator/visitor.; A visitor in the sense that the solver calls the numerics and gives it (read-only) access to all its data, the object pulls whatever it needs directly and there is no need for numerics->SetBlaBla.; A template decorator in the sense that the class can be augmented simply by inheriting from another, along the lines of `class CRoeVisc : public CRoe, public CVisc` (to allow fusing residual and Jacobian contributions).; All this needs to be done with templates for the ""minimal indirection"" requirement. Which means for each numerical method we will have 4 explicit template instantiations (Euler2D, Euler3D, (RA)NS2D, (RA)NS3D) but in the end these are still polymorphic objects that will be instantiated by some factory function (i.e. it will look clean, especially because I will not por",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-622941617:9,update,update,9,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-622941617,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"On both questions the answer is yes. Option 1 can be implemented right now but will require the creation of temporary objects. Option 2 can directly forward the data to the blas routines. The tool I am developing is no tool for a specific linear algebra package. The idea is, that the tool parses the header files of the library. The user has then to define which objects are active lvalues and the derivatives for each operation in the library. For small an clear interfaces this is no problem and works already quite good. For large libraries like Eigen I adopted a whitelisting approach. That is, every function needs to be manually whitelisted to trigger the expression generation of the tool. In a prototype way I have also implemented an approach where only the active lvalues need to be defined and the tool looks then for all required functions and other objects that depend on these active objects. Long story short, the tool is designed to handle ""any"" library. It is even possible to mix several libraries together. My current status on this project is, that I am now through with the parsing of the header files and the generation of the expressions. This works quite well for Eigen which is a hardcore testcase, since every possible programming tweak in C++ is used here. The next step is to add the AD part to the expression generation process.

Deployability,"Probably not, it was a silly idea anyway. Maybe you could perturb the target value of CL instead and measure the variation of alpha for an imposed variation of CL but that is starting to sound quite strange. I don't known how the process to find the alpha that gives you a given CL works, but could the derivative not be obtained from this process? i.e. you could avoid the FD step entirely.

Deployability,"Restructuring of the test cases to separate the config files (now in SU2 repo) from the mesh/solution data (remain in the TestCases repo). The idea is that developers will update their config files along with their code changes in the SU2 repo so that pull requests can be automatically checked with Travis CI. The meshes and solution data, which change much less frequently and are larger files, remain in the TestCases repo. The two repositories contain the same directory structure for the test cases, with complementary (not overlapping) file sets. The responsibility is on the developer to add files to both repositories (in matching directory locations) when adding new test cases. This makes it very easy for one to recombine the full set of files or for Travis CI to do this automatically. To run the test cases locally, one might do the following (assuming paths are set correctly so SU2_CFD is available):. ```; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/SU2.git; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/TestCases.git; $ cd SU2/; $ ./configure; $ make install; $ cp -R ../TestCases/* ./TestCases/; $ cd ./TestCases/; $ python serial_regression.py; ```.

Deployability,"Several bugs have been fixed in the grid deformation and the config file have been updated. . In particular, the inverse volume method uses now an element volume computed in ComputeDeforming_Element_Volume (not the incomplete determinant computed in FEM). fabs have been added to the determinant in the final evaluation of the FEM stiffness matrix (depending on the element orientation, the determinant was negative). The formulation Mu = E / (2.0_(1.0 + Nu)), Lambda = Nu_E/((1.0+Nu)_(1.0-2.0_Nu)) is used instead of the basic simplification Mu = E, Lambda = -E. We can recover that formulation using a large number for Nu (DEFORM_COEFF). The code has been simplified and that IO is now more clear. I have performed some tests and large deformations are now possible. . However, systematic regression tests for grid deformation is required using all the different kinds of elements. I remember that T.

Deployability,"Should we use the branching methodology that we use for the SU2 repository? In the sense that we create a develop branch, create branches for any cases we want to add, submit pull requests that can be reviewed by the rest of the community etc. . I like the idea from @bigfooted, of having some regression testing that can run the simulation for a couple of iterations and check residuals (identical to what we do for the TestCases). This might be redundant to the actual regression tests that are done in SU2, but would be an easy first check on weather a particular validation case needs to be run again. Ideally, this would be run before any major version releases, as we discussed earlier. . I can also start working on creating a section on the website for the results of the validation cases.

Deployability,"Some additional ideas on this topic:. #### Using Github projects; - For compilation of branches, I have created a github project: https://github.com/su2code/SU2/projects/7; - In there, you can list your active/old branches by adding a note to the relevant column. Please be so kind to mark the name of the branch in bold using Markdown's format (`** my branch name **`).; - I have added some examples from my own branches. #### Where do I find my branches?; - We have all worked on branches that we no longer remember, but Github has a really nice feature for this.; - Log-in to your Github user account and go to: https://github.com/su2code/SU2/branches/yours; - All the branches in which you have added at least one commit will be listed there. #### Old branches; - We have found a lot of branches that are older than the latest release and have no commits ahead of master (you can see this in your branch list).; - This would mean that normally all of their commits have already gone into a released version of SU2 and they are no longer required.; - I am planning to do some cleaning of very old branches to have a more compact structure, however it would be helpful if all the developers could indicate explicitly which branches can be safely removed to avoid any future issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/582#issuecomment-423178409:831,release,release,831,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/582#issuecomment-423178409,2,['release'],"['release', 'released']"

Deployability,"Some update here: I had to get rid of the CParse library ... It was too slow since it is based solely on RTTI. I replaced it with [exprtk](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk). This is a fast and widely used expression library. The only drawback is that it is a header-only file with ~40k(!) lines of code. Compilation takes quite long, so I am using pimpl approach to interface it with SU2 in order not to recompile it for every compilation target. Furthermore I added the exprtk code as an archive (similar to what we do with the tecplot IO library).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/913#issuecomment-634295529:5,update,update,5,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/913#issuecomment-634295529,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"Some updates:. - Python wrapper functionalities have been moved into a dedicated python_wrapper_structure.cpp file for code clarity.; - The data structures for the customized values at boundaries have been removed from the CPoint class. Data structures are stored in the geometry class, they are initialized only when customization is set ON and only for involved vertices. There was no restriction to put the data structures in the solver class, except that when multi-grids needs to be updated (required for non uniform field), the geometry class needed an access to the solver class, which is not the case since everything that is in the Common structure seems to be independent of what it is in SU2_CFD, and I wanted to keep that. Those data structures should not be seen as true PDE-related variables, they should be seen as a generic support for boundary customization.; - CHT related labels have been removed and replaced by ""Python customizable"" in order to not introduce any confusion with the native CHT development. The basic purpose of this work is to enable existing boudary conditions to be customized from Python and not to develop a CHT interface. CHT is just an example of application (since only the HEAT_FLUX and ISOTHERMAL walls are customizable for now).; - Based on the previous point, no new specific boundary condition was introduced. For now, I keep the idea to just modify (one single line) the existing boundary conditions to take into account the customization. New dedicated boundary conditions (for example BC_HEAT_FLUX_CUSTOM or BC_ISOTHERMAL_CUSTOM) would be a 99% copy of the originals... Dedicated boundary conditions for native CHT development can still be defined independently (no condlfict). Cheers,.

Deployability,"Sorry for my late reply and thanks Heather for opening this important discussion.; I fully agree with you and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION and OPT_OBJECTIVE cause confusion. As far I see the problem, if we focus on a typical users point of view, I think that OPT_OBJECTIVE and OPT_CONSTRAINT must be in the config file and as close as possible. They are the key to define an optimization problem (one of the key features of SU2). On the other hand, as you suggested we need to add some flexibility. It would be interesting to to able to define a multi-objective like; OPT_OBJECTIVE= DRAG \* DRAG_WEIGHT; LIFT^2 \* LIFT^2_WEIGHT;. As Tim pointed out OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is important because is what we use to play and develop the adjoint capability but, from the users point of view it is not as interesting as the OPT_OBJECTIVE. If everything works ok, OPT_OBJECTIVE should be enough for most of the SU2 users. How many typical users are interested in solving and adjoint problem for the sake of solving of an adjoint problem?. However OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is not a good name, from the point of view of the continuous adjoint, I would feel comfortable if we change it to ADJ_BND_CONDITION. That probably doesn't work for the discrete adjoint, isn't it? Tim, What key word would work for the Discrete Adjoint? We need something that reflect the effect, in mathematical terms, of the objective function in the AD adjoint problem. Finally, before adding any capability we should ask ourself how general is going to be and if it going to be useful for the most part of the SU2 users community (in my opinion, external aerodynamics). If the new objective function is only useful for us, or a research project, then I think we need to create some kind of custom objective function, (e.g. CUSTOM_OBJFUNC at the same level than DRAG, LIFT, etc) that we can describe with other set of parameters.

Deployability,"Sure @bigfooted , This is a recent work by Dr. Nishikawa. Actually there are very few unstructured grid limiters in practice, Barth-Jespersen, Venkatakrishnan and its modifications, Michalek-Gooch (most of them are already implemented in SU2). I just saw the details and thought of implementing it. Also to note, it is tailored for vertex centered schemes not cell centered scheme, hence is apt for SU2. In original paper he showed tests with few inviscid cases. Recently He has revealed that it has been implemented in NASA CFD codes. ; Few things - 1- It is certainly less dissipative in comparison to VK 2- Convergence are similar. Rp limiters may take moderate number of more iterations (being less dissipative). 3- Convergence attributes also depends on many other settings - starting CFL, CFL ramping, convective schemes used etc. Sometimes all will stall.; Overall it's encouraging to try and make use of it in more and more cases.

Deployability,"Sure we do (e.g. `CDiscAdjSolver::RegisterSolution` will behave incorrectly). So actually both ways are based on saving indices somewhere. However the routines that I added (with the `_intIndexBased` extension) do save them internally together with ""their"" corresponding variable (in the same variable class) which is important for the multizone stuff. > So now when we register the coordinates we do it index-based because the multizone_problem boolean is set. We don't want the `_intIndexBased` routines for the FSI cases. They work by re-recording new tapes for each set of variables (fluid solution/coordinates/displacement solution) with added specific routines within the solvers/iterators for cross dependencies (which goes along with saving indices externally, but in a preassigned order). > What are the implications for when we extract the adjoints? Do we need an index-based GetDerivative?. Yes there are counterparts in `RegisterSolution`, `SetAdjoint_Output` and `ExtractAdjoint_Solution`. But nothing more.

Deployability,"Thank you @TobiKattmann for your feedback. The idea behind this new regression test config file is as follows:; We should have a test case that triggers the negative part of the SA model. Depending on the flow conditions, geometry and CFD parameters it might be triggered or not. With the previous config file, it was not. ; I think there is already a regression test in SU2 that triggers the negative SA, the `turb_oneram6_nk`. However, I decided to stick to rae2822 airfoil as it is a simpler (faster) case. In order to force the negative part of the SA for the rae2822 in a reasonable amount of iterations for a regression test, I increased the angle of attack. I have removed the multigrid as it might not be stable, but I have not tested though. Anyway, with the current configuration, e.g., convective scheme, CFL number, etc, the solution is not stable and diverges after some iterations, around 15. In that sense, I reduced the number of iterations from 20 to 10. In my opinion, a diverging regression test is not a problem at all as it might not be used as a tutorial, only to verify the integrity of the commit.

I agree with the fact that there would be a certain difference in the values between the two solvers. But as not as large as what I am getting, as you said. After my initial post on CFD online, I meshed with finer settings and ran different meshes only to find the drop in y+ near that sharp region of the blade root-spinner junction.

In Fluent, the thrust and torque values are in dimensional form and it reports the forces on propeller and spinner in the x-direction as my flow is in that direction. I am not sure why -CFz and -CMz for SU2? I know that the factor to get the dimensional force is calculated using surface normals in the z-direction, and the reference area is based on that.

Deployability,"Thanks @MicK7 I will have a look, my initial thought was to have a simple strategy where within each MPI rank parallelism is extracted via colouring or scatter-to-gather transformations and only one thread per rank participates in the message passing, I have no experience here though so this might be a bad strategy, idk. **Back to business:**; I went silent for a bit because in prototyping a typical residual computation and matrix update loop I made some realisations that made me go back to the drawing board regarding data structures, and eventually back to square 0. . ## Parallel strategy for flux computation; Because significant computation is required to obtain each edge's flux, it does not make sense to attempt a ""point-loop"" strategy (which would double the effort).; However, one can either use colouring to avoid the race conditions that would result from updating the residual of cells i and j, or store the edge fluxes and then, on a second point-loop perform the summation of fluxes for each cell, with the direction being accounted by the same adjacency information used in the point-loop GG gradient computation.; If we consider only the update of residuals the two strategies are fairly equivalent performance wise, the tie breaker is the matrix updates. ## Matrix Updates; By this I mean the `addBlock`, `subBlock` we do (two times each) to update diagonal and off-diagonal blocks for each edge.; Here is a dummy numerics loop that does nothing else but setting blocks in the matrix (with colouring).; ```c++; void testLoop1(const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,size_t> >& connectivity,; double** blk_i, double** blk_j,; SparseMatrix& matrix); {; matrix.setZero();. for(size_t color=0; color<colorStart.size()-1; ++color); #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,CHUNK_SIZE); for(size_t k=colorStart[color]; k<colorStart[color+1]; ++k); {; size_t iEdge = edgeIdx[k];; size_t iPoint = connectivity[iEdge].first;; size_t j",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:435,update,update,435,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,1,['update'],['update']

Regarding the framework I am actually a little bit hesitant to use boost.

However, if we start introducing it into the actual development process people may want to use more and more features of boost and we will have a hard time maintaining versions, compatbilities and so on. And in my opinion we should keep it as simple and lightweight as possible (one of our biggest strengths is the simple compilation/installation, which actually attracts a lot of users).

So far the conclusions are:; - Get 0% to 10% performance loss if you are using MKL (one could always bypass Eigen and call mkl directly).; - Write clean code compatible with AD and that will perform better than most easy implementations.; - Eventually get better performance of the discrete adjoint via the more efficient differentiation of operations with matrix-like objects.; - Have an extra dependency that does not need to be compiled.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-463591821:72,update,update,72,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-463591821,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Thanks for all the questions on the shape optimization. It helps us make improvements to the code to make it easier to use. . You are correct in that the adjoint gradients determine the direction that the optimizer moves the design variables. But this direction can (and usually does) change during the optimization process as it explores different parts of the design space. So the design variables won't always move in the same direction. Sometimes the optimizer won't take the best step in the direction of descent. In this case, the objective function can increase. The optimizer will then try again in the same direction but with a different (usually smaller) step size. If it does achieve a reduction in the objective function, it will usually run the adjoints again to get an updated gradient direction. The objective + adjoint iterations are called major iterations and are what is output by the SLSQP algorithm. This process is more complicated when there are constraints involved. . So in summary, no it is not necessary (or likely) that the objective function will always decrease through an optimization process",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/984#issuecomment-628714360:783,update,updated,783,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/984#issuecomment-628714360,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"Thanks for finding a way to speed things up.; With regards to the tolerance, it would be preferable to update the test values rather than the tolerance, since especially for changes in the integrated values rather than the residual values, small changes over the small number of iterations could indicate a problem that will grow over time. A very small number of iterations is used in the tests in order to save time for the tests. . Are the changes you quote for the original precision, or for the quad-precision? If the latter, and maybe either way, I would recommend running the case for a larger number of iterations to make sure that there aren't larger differences growing over time that would effect the output, maybe due to some other change in the code that hasn't been identified yet.

Deployability,"Thanks for the clarification clarkpede. One of the things I had tried when I first ran into that warning after looking at the code was to create a coarse grid with fewer than 1000 elements (just in case the sensor value was extremely large for a single element for some reason, then it should’ve at least marked that one for adaptation). However, it still output the same results and warning message. I’m not exactly sure how the adaptation index is calculated for the SUPERSONIC_SHOCK or GRAD_FLOW, but is it possible that these values could be negative, causing the sensor value to always be below the threshold value?.

Deployability,"Thanks for the question; The RESTART_SOLUTION option determines only whether the CFD solution will restart from a provided solution file, not whether the optimizer will restart. ; To restart the optimizer process, this must be specified to the python script:; shape_optimization.py -r project.pkl -f config.cfg -n N; The options of all the python scripts can be viewed with a command like:; shape_optimization.py -h. So, to run an optimization process restarted from a previous optimization, and to have each individual simulation restart from previously converged CFD results you will need to BOTH specify RESTART_SOLUTION and the -r python option. To restart the optimizer but have each CFD simulation start from scratch, use the -r option and specify RESTART_SOLUTION=NO. . Restarting from a specified design (rather than the most recent design) is not currently provided as an option, but if you are willing to dig into things manually it may be possible via editing the project.pkl and results.pkl files. .

Deployability,"Thanks for the quick review @pcarruscag. I have cleaned up a little bit. Also added a nicer table of the output. l prefer that we always compute the min/max values, at least for the FVM CFD solvers, for a few reasons. The most important reason is that we should start to build up some intuition about the correlation between mesh quality metrics and accuracy + convergence in the solvers. This can be especially important during optimization when the mesh is deforming. I think the metrics are valuable to print every time for this reason, which might help users diagnose problems eventually. Additionally, the cost is relatively small (on par with the other pre-processing routines, it is only executed once and it is parallelized, and the memory is released if we don't write).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/778#issuecomment-526456264:751,release,released,751,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/778#issuecomment-526456264,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"Thanks for your input, I think you make a good point. . The way I was thinking about it is that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION would now serve the same purpose and have the same behavior across multiple methods - right now (in the current develop and master branch), OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is used either when running SU2_CFD with the continuous or discrete adjoint method, and when running continuous_adjoint.py, while OPT_OBJECTIVE is used with shape_optimization.py.; Where this gets confusing is that shape_optimization.py automatically flips signs of certain objectives without ever informing the user that this is the case - right now the only way to find out that the sign is flipped is either to carefully read through the source code or run a case and figure it out from the results. ; This will get more confusing when adding in multiple objectives - I would like to at least move the sign change into the config file rather than hidden behind the scenes; however that does get dangerous as it will quietly change the optimization behavior for people who aren't aware of that modification.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-185479306:319,continuous,continuous,319,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-185479306,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"Thanks, Tim. Adding flexibility to the FFD is a great contribution. I was just going through the changes and I have a couple of questions:; 1. I noticed that you have added AD as an option for computing the geometric sensitivity component (change in the surface location due to a delta change in the design variable) that multiplies the adjoint sensitivity. Is there a way to make this usable for the continuous adjoint too rather than using finite differencing? This assumes that the user has built the AD version, even though they use the continuous adjoint.; 2.

If you want a more accurate simulation you move the mesh and update the interfaces, there are several advantages to not dealing with the MRF source terms. There are also practical aspects of not updating the interface when doing transient MRF, for example it lets you handle interfaces that are not cylindrical, people use this to model car wheels.; MRF is also less restrictive for time step size than moving mesh, but if you move the interface you bring some of the moving mesh restrictions to MRF.

Deployability,"The discrete adjoint may still run with the chosen objective, since that is entirely defined within the C++, but some additional steps may be needed to run your objective with the Python framework. First, I recommend that you verify in your primal solve that you can compute one of your chosen objectives such as ENTROPY_GENERATION, and that it appears in the history file, since this is a prerequisite for running shape optimization with the Python framework. You should be able to follow details of the old ENTROPY_GENERATION objective if you look in the COutputLegacy::SpecialOutput_Turbo() routine in the legacy output. Note that you may need to do some work to connect this for your particular problem, since as mentioned, the turbomachinery related features are currently being brought into line with the most recent version of the software, and the routine may not be called by default. Once you have your desired objectives being computed and printed to the history file, give the updateHistoryMap.py script a look so that you can update the fields that the python framework can handle. As for custom objectives, there is a variable within the fluid solvers named Total_Custom_ObjFunc that will be differentiated for you if you use it compute a custom expression within the solver class (you can do this in multiple places within the solver class, but make sure it is called). Same suggestions apply for making sure that you can compute the custom objective, it appears in the history file, and that the python script is updated to read that particular field during optimization.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/889#issuecomment-609959747:989,update,updateHistoryMap,989,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/889#issuecomment-609959747,3,['update'],"['update', 'updateHistoryMap', 'updated']"

Deployability,"The solver with the closest functionality to what you are trying to do is the elasticity solver, it may be worth having a look there.

Deployability,"There is an issue for time accurate simulations with multi-stage time integration schemes in combination with multiple (fluid) zones. The reason is that the loop over the multiple (usually Runge-Kutta) stages takes place in the function CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Cycle, while the loop over the zones is carried out in the drivers. Hence the loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages takes place inside the loop over the multiple zones. This is fundamentally wrong and will lead to at most 1st order accuracy in time. Hence, the sequence of these loops should be reversed. In principle there are two ways to do this, namely moving the loop over the Runge-Kutta stages up in the hierarchy, or moving the loop over the zones down. I think the former option is undesirable, because this means that all the details of the different time integration schemes must be moved to the driver, which does not improve readability (to say the least). Furthermore, it leads to serious problems when more advanced time integration schemes (with time accurate local time stepping) are employed. So therefore, in my opinion, the only practical solution is to move the loop over the zones downwards in the hierarchy. This leads to significant changes in the implementation, but does this lead to a fundamental problem for any of the applications of SU2?. Thanks,.

Deployability,"There seems to potentially be a bug with doing an unsteady dual-timestepping simulation without a provided initial condition (restart file):. When no restart file is provided, the first inner iterations have Time_Iter=0 and Cur_Time=0 (the state **before** these inner iterations). After completion of this time iteration, a file `flow_00000.vtu` and all others are outputted. These files are _not_ the initial condition as specified by the configuration file -- they seem to actually be the solution after the first time step. This can be reproduced easily in the config file I have attached to this issue (an updated version of TestCases/plunging_naca0012 for SU2 v8). The `flow_00000.vtu` file has non-uniform flowfields, which doesn't make sense. For simulations where a restart file like `restart_00000.dat` is provided, the Time_Iter=1 and Cur_Time=dt (the state **after** these inner iterations), and the subsequently outputted files have the correct time iteration appended to it. I think that for non-restart unsteady simulations, the IC should be outputted as solely just the initialization before any inner iterations are completed, Time_Iter++ and Cur_Time+=dt, and THEN inner iterations performed.

The control over these constants is given to the user, However based on our 20 years of experience with the k-w models, Omega will not drop below 1E-3 * Omega_infinity (converged solution). However, in the process of convergence, it may reach lower values. Therefore, a value of . C_w = 1E-6. is reasonable. The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low).

It is both a complete refactoring and a streamlining of the routines to remove several bottlenecks (memory and superfluous MPI calls) that were limiting the performance at high rank counts.

Once the periodic BCs are all updated, we will remove the old CPhysicalGeometry constructor and associated routines in order to clean up. **Note that this PR affects everyone using the finite volume solver.** The regressions are going to fail :).

If I understand the logic for this enum option correctly, it should register the flow variables and the mesh coordinates from geometry.
