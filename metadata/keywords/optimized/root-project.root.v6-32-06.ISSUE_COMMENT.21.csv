Deployability,"Well, actually it was less work than I thought.; I implemented now all the additions, changes and suggestions from @lmoneta. I used now std::vector everywhere it's features are useful. For the rest I stayed with using arrays to stay similar to all other TGraph objects. I moved the functions GetPointX, GetPointY, SetPointX, SetPointY and GetObjectInfo to the TGraph class because they apply to any TGraph object and only were in my custom class cause I could not implement them in TGraph without using a custom Root installation. I replaced the funtion SetNErrorDimensions by the functions AddYError and DeleteYError as proposed by @lmoneta. Since I think the meaning of ""dimension"" might not be 100% clear, I exchanged it to a term claryfing that it corresponds to different y errors. Besides that I implemented some further features and fixed a memory leak in the function PaintGraphMultiErrors in the TGraphPainter class. I also added a test macro testing the most critical features like streaming the class, adding / deleting points and y errors and the summation of y errors for fitting with different methods.; Furthermore, I added a small tutorial macro that shows how to use the basic functionalities of the class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-559211358:517,install,installation,517,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-559211358,1,['install'],['installation']

Try to reproduce the problem with vanilla lli of LLVM 9 to check that this is not related to the way Cling incrementally JITs and executes.

In general we tell our users (+/- always) ""can we please see the actual diagnostic"", and for the same reasons it's super helpful to include them here.

Deployability,"You should be able to guarantee what gets initialized first, either in your codebase or via the linker. I wish there was a better or even feasible-to-implement way to solve this more elegantly. The underlying issue is that whenever there in unknown (to the interpreter) symbol it will ask the JIT to resolve it. It tries to resolve the symbol via the usual dynamic linker rules and as a last resort it gives the control to ROOT. ROOT, in turn, uses dlsym and dladdr (which have platform-specific bugs) to find the unknown symbol (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx#L6418). Unfortunately, we do not have enough information at that point to be able to distinguish between which symbol is supposed to come from libCling or not. Thus we have a conservative strategy in resolving as much as we can from libCling and if something slips through use later-dlopened libraries. I presume a somewhat better fix would be to make a dlsym and a dlsym in libCling and always return the version of the symbol in libCling.

[Some doc](https://www.marnel.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ms-fonts_alternatives.pdf) suggests ""Symbol Neu"", but [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/google-croscore-fonts/blob/rawhide/f/google-croscore-fonts.spec#_159) seems to suggest that they are not ""released"" anymore, whatever that means.

Deployability,[The way it is implemented](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TF1_8cxx_source.html#l01408) makes it mandatory to have an active pad with the TF1 drawn in it. That's why you need to add these `gPad->Update()` if you really want to use this function (see my first example). My second reply does exactly the same thing as DrawIntegral without the `GetSelectedPad()`. That's the simpler/better way when you run compiled ROOT like you.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13708#issuecomment-1734857976:196,Update,Update,196,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13708#issuecomment-1734857976,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"ast top-level expression's value is printed if missing trailing semicolon) should be kept for consistency and simplicity reasons.; > ; > Let's hear some other opinions here, e.g. @SimeonEhrig @jalopezg-uc3m @pcanal ?. I do realize my post was terse. Here is more text as the discussion went in another direction. Since early days, as you already mentioned, the rule seems to be ""the last expression without a trailing semicolon should print"". If that is the rule, then it clearly does not handle short-hand operators. Namely, `if (x) expr`. That rule does not extend to your examples `do 1 while(true)` as `while` is not really an user-defined expression. `if (x) { expr }` does not fall there either as it is in a compound statement. It is pretty clear where we stop. The construct `if(x) expr`, as shown in the example, enables an interactive programming pattern wrt error handling where in case of an error we can just ask cling to print details. > I'd prefer to keep value printing simple. The implementation of what I propose requires 2-3 lines [here](https://github.com/vgvassilev/cling/blob/856f8e92f82f9037b3dbb27ae7f94add2ed6121f/lib/Utils/AST.cpp#L141-L152). And actually makes the value printing rule more comprehensible. It took me some time to realize what's wrong and I implemented it, so I'd say it would be less comprehensible to other people. > and instead invest where it's relevant: devtoolset, debug symbols, llvm upgrade (to llvm 11!), etc. This is a trade-off we should consciously do, and given that this is the first time I hear a request for value printing within nested blocks . We have had that in the past. I do not think having not user requests should be an argument against this bug. > I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the effort (and yes, that's an additional counter argument). And I'm not just talking dev time but also long-term maintenance: more code, more clang interfaces used.

Deployability,"ate your proposed solutions but I do not really have a lot of bandwidth nowadays to investigate why they do not work for us. You will probably see what's going wrong if you build this PR locally. I have built locally and don't see the issue (I don't even know what I'm looking for). Both you and @pcanal asked me to fix this and I spent actual time trying to figure out what you guys were after and implementing a solution that has little cost for both of us. I too suffer from lack time, so asking me to do work then walking away without even giving a single example of what is broken seems a bit rude.... Seriously, can I get one test that still fails with https://reviews.llvm.org/D33529 ?. If that cannot be done could @pcanal or @Axel-Naumann at least verify that after applying D33529 and setting `DynamicLibrary::SearchOrder = SO_LoadedFirst; // or SO_LoadedLast (don't know the problem)` 500+ tests are broken?. > I would appreciate if we can coordinate next time such breaking changes before asking for a llvm review and land patches in these particularly sensitive areas. I explicitly added you to the list of reviewers for the original patch, there is little more I can do than that. And more coordination is exactly what I am trying to do now. If we cannot reach a conclusion may I at least be added to review whatever your solution looks like?. > 1. I plan to remove the NDEBUG assert. Already done in D33529. > 2. Make the std::vector<void*> a std::vector<llvm::PointerIntPair<void*, 1, bool>>. How can you guarantee that the platform will deliver a pointer with proper alignment for that?. > 3. I will change the search order to search for first the one that are not marked RTLD_GLOBAL. So any other client that wants to open thing's with RTLD_LOCAL will then expose what they thought were private symbols to the JIT as a whole?. > One of the issues is that it is not clear to me is what exactly is your use case and this is why there are misunderstandings.

Deployability,"bably see what's going wrong if you build this PR locally. I have built locally and don't see the issue (I don't even know what I'm looking for). Both you and @pcanal asked me to fix this and I spent actual time trying to figure out what you guys were after and implementing a solution that has little cost for both of us. I too suffer from lack time, so asking me to do work then walking away without even giving a single example of what is broken seems a bit rude.... Seriously, can I get one test that still fails with https://reviews.llvm.org/D33529 ?. If that cannot be done could @pcanal or @Axel-Naumann at least verify that after applying D33529 and setting `DynamicLibrary::SearchOrder = SO_LoadedFirst; // or SO_LoadedLast (don't know the problem)` 500+ tests are broken?. > I would appreciate if we can coordinate next time such breaking changes before asking for a llvm review and land patches in these particularly sensitive areas. I explicitly added you to the list of reviewers for the original patch, there is little more I can do than that. And more coordination is exactly what I am trying to do now. If we cannot reach a conclusion may I at least be added to review whatever your solution looks like?. > 1. I plan to remove the NDEBUG assert. Already done in D33529. > 2. Make the std::vector<void*> a std::vector<llvm::PointerIntPair<void*, 1, bool>>. How can you guarantee that the platform will deliver a pointer with proper alignment for that?. > 3. I will change the search order to search for first the one that are not marked RTLD_GLOBAL. So any other client that wants to open thing's with RTLD_LOCAL will then expose what they thought were private symbols to the JIT as a whole?. > One of the issues is that it is not clear to me is what exactly is your use case and this is why there are misunderstandings. I also don't understand why there are mis-understandings, but have explained the use case a few times now and **3** will explicitly break that as well as provide biz",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/744#issuecomment-313799028:1158,patch,patch,1158,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/744#issuecomment-313799028,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`. Much more disk space usage that needed, but otherwise also a decent solution. Might even be best. All three methods should be supported by this standalone build system.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161:1171,install,installed,1171,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161,3,"['Install', 'install']","['Install', 'installed', 'installing']"

If it did not, why? If it is just a matter of typing less awkward strings for an extremely custom use case, then your patch cannot be accepted and I suggest replacing it with some good documentation for the end user :-). So no, the approach as it is does not work for us as :. a) we rarely stage full archives (that’s for sure); b) out of my head right now I cannot find back why but I kind of remember the proto://xxx?filter_aliversion#…. syntax did cause an issue somewhere. > As an alternative, you can provide them with a macro that generates the Query= part for you, if it is less awkward for them.; > ; > Ah, I also see that between your patches there is an option to ""stat"" the file if filtered. I can see the point there: stating a file which is not there would trigger a download on a specifically configured xrootd storage. This specific patch cannot be accepted by any means as it goes against a concept we have been trying to establish since a long time: ROOT's dataset manager is about managing lists of files.

Deployability,"ebug = 6``` to get the full output from clang. Maybe the defaults need to be reconsidered here. The optimal solution here for pyroot/cppyy in general is maybe a bit involved. What is probably desired is; 1) Don't print the clang output, but store any errors or warnings during template instantiation attempts e.g. using ```cling::utils::DiagnosticsStore```; 2) If no template is successfully instantiated then print the stored warnings and errors for each case; 3) If a template is successfully instantiated, but had warnings, at least print those for the successful case. I have some idea what's going wrong with the error detection as well, more news on that soon. \*; ```gdb; Thread 1 ""python"" hit Breakpoint 1, 0x00007ffff2df28e0 in clang::Sema::InstantiateFunctionDefinition(clang::SourceLocation, clang::FunctionDecl*, bool, bool, bool) () from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; (gdb) bt; #0 0x00007ffff2df28e0 in clang::Sema::InstantiateFunctionDefinition(clang::SourceLocation, clang::FunctionDecl*, bool, bool, bool) (); from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; #1 0x00007ffff1a30ff7 in cling::overloadFunctionSelector(clang::DeclContext*, bool, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, clang::LookupResult&, clang::DeclarationNameInfo&, clang::TemplateArgumentListInfo const*, clang::ASTContext&, clang::Parser&, clang::Sema&, cling::LookupHelper::DiagSetting) () from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; #2 0x00007ffff1a387f7 in clang::FunctionDecl const* cling::findFunction<clang::FunctionDecl const*>(clang::DeclContext*, llvm::StringRef, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, bool, clang::ASTContext&, cling::Interpreter*, clang::FunctionDecl const* (*)(clang::DeclContext*, bool, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, clang::LookupResult&, clang::DeclarationNameInfo&, clang::TemplateArgumentListInfo const*, clang::ASTContext&, clang::Parser&, clang::Sema&, cling::LookupHelper::DiagSetting), cling::LookupHelper::Diag",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11854#issuecomment-1455272493:1502,install,install,1502,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11854#issuecomment-1455272493,1,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"es.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```.

When it crashes, `nbig` is `-1`, and resize() expects and unsigned int. The -1 becomes a very large unsigned number that exceeds the maximum allowed length of a `std::string`. To me that looks more like a problem with IO than with HistFactory (the memory layout of the `HistFactory::Measurement` classes hasn't changed from 6.26 to 6.28. Is that something that makes sense to you, @pcanal? What does this `nbig` stand for, and in which circumstances can this be `-1`?. Maybe in the best case, the fix would just be adding a simple `if(nbig >= 0)` before the call to `resize()`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520:7738,install,install,7738,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520,1,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"g.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:2560,install,install,2560,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,1,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-890998817): I stuck with the detection of `dynamic_cast` vs. `static_cast` at compile time to also support non-polymorphic types.; > .

Deployability,"get rid of the error I run into a problem when checking them:. In the pairdict example I can run the following in the root prompt. ```; root [2] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [3] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) nullptr; ```. So the list of base classes doesn't exist. While for a `std::pair<int,int>` I get the correct base class to `__pair_base<int,int>` and it does have a class pointer:. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,int>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7ffd1c3fce98; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x1a678d0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,int> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) 0x1a3e5f0; ```. Now after adding `#pragma link C++ class std::pair<int, MyClass::MyEnum>+;` to the `linkdef.h` the error message is gone but I get the following. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7fff4c93b268; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x19c4bd0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,MyClass::MyEnum> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) nullptr; ```. I do have the proper hierarchy but the `__pair_base` base class doesn't have a valid ClassPointer so I'm not convinced this is all working as intended. Now I can solve this weirdness as well by requesting the `std::_pair_base<T1,T2>` dictionaries as well. But at this point I am a bit skeptical so I would like some confirmation that this is not just some stupidity on my side. .

If it did not, why? If it is just a matter of typing less awkward strings for an extremely custom use case, then your patch cannot be accepted and I suggest replacing it with some good documentation for the end user :-). So no, the approach as it is does not work for us as :. a) we rarely stage full archives (that’s for sure); b) out of my head right now I cannot find back why but I kind of remember the proto://xxx?filter_aliversion#…. syntax did cause an issue somewhere. > As an alternative, you can provide them with a macro that generates the Query= part for you, if it is less awkward for them.; > ; > Ah, I also see that between your patches there is an option to ""stat"" the file if filtered. I can see the point there: stating a file which is not there would trigger a download on a specifically configured xrootd storage.

As for the original CMake configuration error, my guess is that the CMake target ""host"" used to be part of the CMake project, but is no longer part of the CMake project, and that the error message in `interpreter/cling/CMakeLists.txt:196` was not updated to reflect this when the CMake target ""host"" was removed from the CMake project. As for the error on the final generation of `lib/modules.idx`, the issue seems to be with `root.exe` which is invoked with the following build step command: . ```shell; cd /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib: ROOTIGNOREPREFIX=1 ROOT_HIST=0 /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/bin/root.exe -l -q -b; ```.

Deployability,"ion"").; https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```.

Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default? (we always needed the default parameter to be printed ... and actually in most case, we 'worked' at making sure that all the component are explicitly included (with the right spelling, i.e. for 'opaque' typedef), (see Utils/AST.cpp and the partial desugaring). That was my take as well but without this switch we get failures like this one https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1135181954.

Deployability,"king leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol. [Screencast from 2024-07-26 10-47-18.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a21ea3e-c130-42af-b50b-bb324b06eaaa). TL;DR: After this patch the leftover memory increase may be attributed mostly to Dask or memray itself. To confirm this, I have executed the full AGC benchmark on the SWAN platform with 64 workers of the CERN condor pools for 10 times in a row. At the end of the 10th run all the workers have a total RSS of < 1GB.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470:1954,patch,patch,1954,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"ng binary ready to use.; > > ; > > ; > > The root PR does not solve my problem. I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine. I'm not sure, if there more cases. @vgvassilev Do you have an idea? Maybe you saw something, which can help me, during your porting work. If not, it is not problem. Then, I simply have to spent more time.; > ; > I found the problem and a possible fix. The problem happens in the Interpreter instance for the device code. In the function `IncrementalExecutor::runStaticInitializersOnce()`, there is the line `llvm::orc::VModuleKey K = emitModule(T.takeModule(), T.getCompilationOpts().OptLevel);`, which removes the `llvm::Module` from the transaction. Because `generatePTX()` is called afterwards, `getLastTransaction->getModule` returns a `nullptr`. At the moment, I don't know, why the device compiler creates a static initializer on the device site. On the host site, it is necessary to register the CUDA kernel. At the moment, my solution is a if-guard in `Interpreter::executeTransaction()`:; > ; > ```c++; > if(!m_Opts.CompilerOpts.CUDADevice); > ExeRes = m_Executor->runStaticInitializersOnce(T);; > ```; > ; > I need to verify, if this is a good solution. That's what I was about to say, now the JIT takes the ownership of the `llvm::Module` and then, once it is done JITing, returns it back to the transaction. I think what your patch is doing is that, it forces the JIT to run on the `llvm::Module` and return the ownership to the transaction. Maybe not the best in terms of performance, but we should review the entire model where we have Transaction holding a pointer to a `llvm::Module`...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-777250984:4956,patch,patch,4956,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-777250984,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages. I did this only when two messages printed the same information in succession.; * In a few cases, I changed debug output so that variables are printed in one line that were printed in several lines. A log is easier to grep and scroll through when variables are on the same line as the prefix.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799:1474,patch,patch,1474,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"ot an actual file: it contains a special string that tells the dataset stager (`afdsmgrd`: or more precisely, the download script it invokes for each file) to:; - Take the source file `alien://path/AliESDs.root` from AliEn; - Apply filtering of type `ESDMUON`; - Use AliPhysics `vAN-20150213` for that purpose; - Stage a file called `root://path/AliESDs.FILTER_ESDMUON_WITH_ALIPHYSICS_vAN-20150213.root` on your local cluster. (Please correct me if I am wrong.). I remember that some time ago we have agreed on having 34bb2e2b5f addressing the problem: `Query=<string>` was used to append an arbitrary `?<string>` to the generated filename. For instance:. ```; Find;FileName=AliESDs.root;BasePath=/alice/data/2011/LHC11h/000169838/ESDs/pass2_muon;Query=ESDMUON_vAN-20150213; ```. would generate filenames in the form:. ```; proto://path/root_archive.zip?ESDMUON_vAN-20150213#AliESDs.root; ```. **Question:** did this approach work for you (again, see this: 34bb2e2b5f)? If it did not, why? If it is just a matter of typing less awkward strings for an extremely custom use case, then your patch cannot be accepted and I suggest replacing it with some good documentation for the end user :-). As an alternative, you can provide them with a macro that generates the `Query=` part for you, if it is less awkward for them. Ah, I also see that between your patches there is an option to ""stat"" the file if filtered. I can see the point there: stating a file which is not there would trigger a download on a specifically configured xrootd storage. This specific patch cannot be accepted by any means as it goes against a concept we have been trying to establish since a long time: ROOT's dataset manager is about _managing lists of files_. Staging files is a job that must be done elsewhere, for instance by a storage system or by a mechanism interacting with it. Thing is, we let data management in ROOT out of the door for a reason, and we don't want it to come in again through the window :-).

Deployability,"otten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure that there's any good way of addressing this short; of having ROOT release the core mutex before calling dlopen.; But this would probably require introducing another mutex for use; in at least TClass::GetClass to serialize dictionary loading.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:2068,release,release,2068,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"ou can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. If RooFitZMQ only makes sense as a support library for RooFit::MultiProcess, it's better to put them together in a single pull request. It will be much easier to ensure everything works together that way.; ; > I think that fail-on-missing is only relevant in case there would be a non built-in option as well, right?. That is not what users generally think. They want `fail-on-missing` to work reliably and make configuration fail if a dependency cannot be met with system packages. The only exceptions to this rule should be LLVM/Clang.; ; > Finally, about git history: makes sense. I can do some reordering before merging. Otherwise, just squashing everything would make sense to me as well. The two independent things here are basically 1) the zmq builtin and 2) RooFitZMQ itself. These could indeed just be two commits, but since nothing really depends on RooFitZMQ at this point, including it with the libzmq builtin in one commit I think would give a clean history as well. Ok, as long as it's possible to use a vanilla zeromq, and the builtin addition is the last commit in the series, it should be ok.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870570029:2120,configurat,configuration,2120,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870570029,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

I simply wanted to add an explanation why Philippe suggests the inclusion of the actual diagnostic (and why I found it convincing and do it ever since he propose it to me). This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). I am not sure if pasting a diagnostic from a random system makes this clearer in any form.

Deployability,"processExecutorH1Test is pre-existing. Eventhough this PR make tp_process_imt faster, we still observe variation in its run-time (It has 4 steps each taking less than 20s in most case on the jenkins but sometimes going as high as 5 minutes!). It is yet unclear why that is. On remote nodes (from FNAL for example) the run-time of one of the steps goes down from 7m to 1m thanks to this update. So merging while we try to continue to investigate cause of the instability.

Deployability,"rg/D77598#inline-1057607). The idea is when we print the values of integral types, we should print them as they were written. Here is an example where this does not happen https://godbolt.org/z/MGK5s734G so this patch should be easy to upstream. > ; > [4417a2c](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4417a2cd34effdc6ea59797c2d86b6ef8ca8717a) : add default template parameter to the printing. Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default?

Deployability,"rtitions` attribute if the user doesn't provide one. The idea, for the moment at least, is to get information about how many cores are available in the distributed cluster to the user application and submit one task per core. In the case of Dask, this is done by accessing the `client.scheduler_info()` dictionary, which in turn contains a `worker` key which value is another dictionary of information about the workers. [The current approach](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/adf9ea8131ce786f58ff2d9446449f9680063292/bindings/experimental/distrdf/python/DistRDF/Backends/Dask/Backend.py#L45) assumed that if this key was present than it must mean that the Dask client has the information about how many cores are available. Unfortunately, as you just demonstrated, this is not the case. In particular, the `dask-jobqueue` interface has a rather annoying quirk, that is whenever you have already called the code to setup the `cluster` and the `client` objects, nothing is really ""ready to run"" yet. Instead, your Dask application will still be waiting for the batch system (HTCondor in this case) to actually give it resources. This has the side-effect that the dictionary I mentioned above contains the key `workers`, but that is an empty dictionary. You can check this by adding a ; ```python; print(client.scheduler_info()); ```; call after you create your `client` in the application. This effect can be mitigated if you first call `client.wait_for_workers(N_WORKERS)` before calling anything else RDF related. This will supposedly make sure that HTCondor has released resources to the Dask cluster (according to [the docs](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#distributed.Client.wait_for_workers)). With that being said, the `optimize_npartitions` function in the Dask backend should not be sensitive to this kind of effect, so in the linked PR I made the check a bit stronger so that in your reproducer above the `npartitions` should correctly default to two instead of zero.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655:1744,release,released,1744,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"so .... in short your right and the patch does not go far enough. historically TTreeProcessor[MT] was (one of) the first to use multi-threading on TFile. TFile::ReadProcessID was found to be performance/scaling critical so much so that it lead to the introduction of the SpinLocks and the ReadWrite locks ... and at the time there was no point in having the lock taken when that code was not active ... Obviously this is no longer the case. The extension of the use case means that actually we need to protect TFile::ReadProcessID from other use of the TProcessID interfaces (the only other direct user of the collection ```TProcessID::GetPIDs```. This means that we should probably no longer rely on ```TFile::ReadProcessID``` using its own lock. . Also related, we ought to actually leverage the ReadWrite lock in TProcessID.cxx where some of the write section are currently too long, some are missing and some items likely need to become atomic.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5288#issuecomment-608729545:36,patch,patch,36,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5288#issuecomment-608729545,1,['patch'],['patch']

In user's machine, I think it is unlikely that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset because if ROOT is successfully installed in the machine, they should be set. Thus I'm not 100% sure that we should add DynamicPath to search because it causes overhead in the lookup.; 2. Instead, I think we can change Clang code to abort when it generates implicit modules on-demand and emit error messages.

Deployability,"that will be a challenge. We see this after we package ROOT in an RPM. I can try to setup something but not on lxplus and it will take time. . Meanwhile, could you tell me if there is a way to force ROOT to look for the modulemap.module in a given place ? ; Why would ROOT not find the modulemap installed in an item of `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` ? . I can reproduce the issue on a local setup by simply deleting the `module.modulemap`. So it is really just ROOT not finding the module.modulemap.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15318#issuecomment-2152689664:296,install,installed,296,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15318#issuecomment-2152689664,1,['install'],['installed']
Deployability,"the Google C++ guidelines. I think this is not something we should spend too much time on now, but maybe good to keep in mind for the future.; 3. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672519457 The configuration parameters (GlobalObservables etc.): should we unify them or keep like this?; 4. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672538377 This should be checked by Wouter. In addition, some other remaining questions:; 1. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test.; 2. In an ideal world I would have liked to add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, this will take time. The advantage would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the MultiProcess minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in ""PR 7"" (see overview). So, up for discussion, two choices: A: add (probably mostly useless except for testing this PR) ""LikelihoodGradientSerial"" class (based on RooGradMinimizerFcn) so we can add an integration test in this PR; B: wait for the integration test in PR 7.; 3. Does everybody like the RooNLLVar statics?; 4. Offset in the new TestStatistics classes can easily include the RooSubsidiaryL term as well, unlike with RooAbsTestStatistic, where the RooConstraintSum was a separate class that would not be included in the offset. I have now implemented a legacy mode to get bit-wise equal results, but is the new ""full"" mode a good idea at all? Does it make sense?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#issuecomment-915217168:2074,integrat,integration,2074,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#issuecomment-915217168,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"uh, @Axel-Naumann @linev since https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/3679 (included in 3.11.2), `nlohmann-json` also installs `json_fwd.hpp` in case of `JSON_MultipleHeaders=OFF` (which btw changed its default to `ON` in https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/3532 for 3.11.0). What this means is that we can check for the header and use it if present. If it's not there, we can assume we have an older version (pre 3.11) and continue to use the forward declaration as it's written now. This would leave a small range of unsupported versions (3.11.0 and 3.11.1 built with `JSON_MultipleHeaders=OFF`), but I think that would be fine.

Deployability,"ust a matter of typing less awkward strings for an extremely custom use case, then your patch cannot be accepted and I suggest replacing it with some good documentation for the end user :-). So no, the approach as it is does not work for us as :. a) we rarely stage full archives (that’s for sure); b) out of my head right now I cannot find back why but I kind of remember the proto://xxx?filter_aliversion#…. syntax did cause an issue somewhere. > As an alternative, you can provide them with a macro that generates the Query= part for you, if it is less awkward for them.; > ; > Ah, I also see that between your patches there is an option to ""stat"" the file if filtered. I can see the point there: stating a file which is not there would trigger a download on a specifically configured xrootd storage. This specific patch cannot be accepted by any means as it goes against a concept we have been trying to establish since a long time: ROOT's dataset manager is about managing lists of files. Staging files is a job that must be done elsewhere, for instance by a storage system or by a mechanism interacting with it.; > ; > Well, the intent of this part of the patch was to get a correct feed back (for the user) about the actual size of the file (as the size in the collection is the alien catalog size, i.e. before filtering). What you say here is that I cannot do that with a stat as this would trigger a download (in case the file is not there), do I get it correctly ? Any idea on how to achieve what I want ?; > Thing is, we let data management in ROOT out of the door for a reason, and we don't want it to come in again through the window :-); > ; > Well, yes, except that users do need data management at some point….

Switch to using the `VDT::VDT` library during the build.; - For this you need to introduce a global imported library for `builtin_vdt`.

Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default? (we always needed the default parameter to be printed ... and actually in most case, we 'worked' at making sure that all the component are explicitly included (with the right spelling, i.e. for 'opaque' typedef), (see Utils/AST.cpp and the partial desugaring).

So for example the commit ""Coverity 94053: fixed uninitialised class members"" is twice in your master's history (that is because the merge/resolve conflict rather than having done a rebase). At this point the best is to do some manual intervention on your repository to 'clean-up' your master. . This would include:; * make a branch out of your master to make sure to not lose anything:; ```git branch masterApril2017 203703f```; * do a hard reset of master to match origin/master; ```git checkout master; git reset --hard origin/master```; * Re-apply the commit with a merge conflict.; ```git diff 6c63896..ed09395 math/mathmore/test/testInterpolation.cxx | patch -p1; git commit -m ""Redo: removed duplicate increment in for loop (c627ce92488abd79)""```; * cherry-pick the two new commits ; ```git cherry-pick e815eaa 203703f```. In the future, I recommend that rather than working directly in the master, you consider working on a ""feature"" branch. See for example: http://geant.cern.ch/content/suggested-work-flow-distributed-projects-nosy.

Deployability,"ystery to me at the moment. I recommend that it is actually investigated and understood as this 'seeming random behavior' is likely to be 'use of undefined behavior in the code (somewhere)' or (less likely) the correct behavior but we are completely misunderstanding what's going on under the hood. > It seems to me that failure is the right behavior. It is not :) . I am sure we can agree that an 'undo X' should return the state to a point as if the last X cling related actions had not happened. I.e. the simplified example:. ```; struct Marker { ~Marker() { fprintf(stdout,""dest\n""); } };; .L lib/libStrip.so ; Marker m2;; gInterpreter->AutoParse(""SiStripCluster"");; .undo 2; SiStripCluster obj;; ```. should actually have the same result (assuming no side effect for Marker::Marker) as. ```; struct Marker { ~Marker() { fprintf(stdout,""dest\n""); } };; .L lib/libStrip.so ; SiStripCluster obj;; ```. and it does not (when modules are turned on) ... possibly because the implicit AutoParse (that is triggered by the use of the symbol SiStripCluster) is no longer possible, in the module case, after the first execution (for example because the first execution of the AutoParse is switching some flag, like I already read this part of the pcm file, that is not 'reset'/'reverted' by the undo. > @pcanal, can you remember what exactly we were testing there?. It is testing both that in this setup the undo is not running into an infinite loop and that we correctly support an (implicit or explicit) AutoParse followed by undo followed by an implicit AutoParse. See the related commit:; ```; commit b6296198c2735101051daa33af89fe8ae641991e (fix_cms); Author: Philippe Canal <pcanal@fnal.gov>; Date: Wed Oct 21 21:59:31 2015 -0500.

Energy Efficiency," don't know how they really work and I refuse to make the functionality of my code rely on something I don't understand.; Furthermore, using ROOT objects provides the advantage that the streaming of the storage class is fully handled by the class itself and therefore there is no need to think about the correct way to stream it. I'm also not 100% sure whether STL containers can be streamed by an automatically built streamer but ROOT classes can be streamed by them for sure.; Last but not least I hold the opinion that ROOT classes should use other ROOT classes anywhere possible, cause we, the programmers, can always change ROOT classes if we need to, but we are not able to change C++ classes. > Thank you for explaining the meaning of SetDimensionEY, I think the name is not super clear, I would maybe just call it SetEY.; > One comment on the passed array, I think the pointers should be passed as cont , since they will not be modified. I fully agree on these points. > One other comment I have , I will not have a method to Set the error dimension. I think it will be better instead a AddError method that will increment by one the dimension and add all the point errors. This I think it will be more useful. This point I don't fully understand. To me it sounds like you propose to add a function like this:; ```; void TGraphMultiErrors::AddError(const Double_t *eyL = 0, const Double_t *eyH = 0); {; SetNErrorDimensions(fNErrorDimensions + 1);; if (eyL && eyH); SetDimensionEY(fNErrorDimensions - 1, eyL, eyH);; }; ```; This would definitly be an useful addition, but I would keep the SetNErrorDimensions function, because otherwise there would be no way to reduce the amount of error dimensions which could be problematic when you want to store the object in a file but not all error dimensions are required. Reducing the amount of dimensions in that case also reduces the amount of storage required, which will be especially important using several graphs or graphs with a lot of points.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-558178093:2059,reduce,reduce,2059,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-558178093,2,['reduce'],"['reduce', 'reduces']"
Energy Efficiency," enabled. So catch-22. Shipped PCMs also prevent developers from using OpenMP with Cling, but at least that can still be done in libraries, which can be linked without otherwise exposing OpenMP. However, the baked-in choice for _not_ having AVX means not only that Cling can not use it, but also causes binary incompatability with libraries that were compiled with AVX enabled (e.g. many/most Eigen-based codes). Then there is the version of C++ being fixed by the PCMs (and worse, in RConfig.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go.

Energy Efficiency," problem occurs also when you get a PDF from the RooDataHist using RooHistPdf. If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't. In this case I didn't find how to fix the problem (the RooHistPdf code is a lot more complicated than the RooDataHist routine) but checking the behaviour of the PDF (i.e fitting the PDF to the RooDataHist), everything looks ok both for the fixed and variable size histogram.

Energy Efficiency,"705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator.

Energy Efficiency,"> ; > Comments?. This looks awesome!. > A few caveats:; > ; > * `PagedVector` is a bad name, I agree. Suggestions are welcome. We did not come up with a better name. Ours was `SparseVector`. Just to confirm, we do not pre-allocate the entire vector but we deterministically allocate the slabs. That is, if I hardcoded an offset `101` in my code and the pre-allocation allocated just a slab [0-100), then when I do PagedVector[101] it would put what I need where I need it, right?. > ; > * At the moment the implementation allows generic callbacks for ranges, however as I said we only need default initialisation. Removing such flexibility should buy another 1 MB from my test. If it is not needed, let's keep it simple. It would be easier to go through the upstream llvm reviews. > ; > * In case `DeclID*` and `QualType` can default to all 0, one could probably achieve the same result in a more elegant way using calloc / realloc. Can we make the API of the `PagedVector` such that it becomes a drop-in replacement? I have not looked deeply in the PR but I see some work being done on the users side. > ; > * There are probably other vectors which can be optimised in the same way, in particular IdentifiersLoaded as already mentioned by @vgvassilev.

I bet it's useful to propose changes coming out of this upstream where relevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ).

Energy Efficiency,"> > the performance of the llvm::SmallVector comes from the fact it is not exception safe; > ; > Can you elaborate a bit? For us, the performance boost in RVec 2.0 comes from the small buffer optimization, which reduces the amount of heap allocations during analysis event loops. The implementation of SmallVector in llvm assumes it is used in codebases without exception support (like llvm itself). Thus the implementation can make some assumptions which the general std::vector cannot. See some terse documentation [here](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1SmallVector.html). There are two things I'd encourage you to try and see if you can reach the same level of small buffer optimization as you got now:; * Make a wrapper class which always takes an assumed size over std::vector and call std::vector::reserve; * Make a wrapper class which takes a template argument assumed size and try to allocate the assumed size on the stack, if it exceeds that, call underlying std::vector and move things there.

I don't have any power on the process that fail itself, it's a task run inside of the `dask` worker and its scheduling is out of my control. On other news, I made a few more tests focusing on the version of dask `distributed` module. In the description of the issue above I stated `distributed==2022.7.1`, this was my starting version for the tests I will describe in the following.

Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. .

Energy Efficiency,"> Are there plans/work in progress for ROOT to move to a newer cppyy anytime soon?. Hi @taehyounpark! We have recently upgraded the cppyy frontend in ROOT, which will be part of ROOT 6.32:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14507. However, it doesn't fix this reproducer. I suspect that this also requires to synchronize the [cppyy-backend](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend/tree). The problem is that this backend is a fork of ROOT itself, including cling. And then, cppyy made patches to this fork of cling/ROOT for e.g. better lambda support and other advanced C++ features and details of the type system. The problem is that we can't take these patches 1 to 1 back to ROOT, because ROOT also used Cling for other things like IO, and the patches in cppyy did not have to consider compatibility with that. We try to make cppyy independent of cling on the long term to solve this conundrum. In the meantime, I can see what we are exactly missing in upstream ROOT or Cling to make the reproducer in this issue work. Maybe it is an uncontroversial patch. This will also take some time though. I worked a lot on PyROOT in the last weeks and have to work on other responsibilities in the next weeks before coming back to this. Or maybe @wlav has a hint?. > In the meantime, might there be anything I could try to ""persuade"" similar quirks, from either C++ or Python to make them work?. Unfortunately not. In ROOT, we don't use complicated template code with type traits in user interfaces. That's maybe my recommendation to you: can you simplify the user-facing interface and hide the templated stuff maybe behind some type-erased types or simplify it a bit? IMHO, templates are great for efficient implementations, but for user interfaces it can be a nightmare (think only about the error messages...).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15062#issuecomment-2022342966:1698,efficient,efficient,1698,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15062#issuecomment-2022342966,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"> I think that is sufficient efficient evidence albeit there is one more simple test to do, is to introduce a synchronization point every once in a while to insure that the queue is actually filled/used and then later emptied. Right; for this I went back to the variant of the benchmark that has perfectly balanced time per event and fills identical data into 10 branches. Then I added barriers around the call to `TBufferMergerFile::Write()` to make sure there is as much synchronization and contention as possible. With that, only the run with 64 threads on `/data/ssdext4` is measurably slower (4m16s instead of 3m57s, 9%), lower numbers of threads show very similar performance within noise. However, I then realized that the second barrier after the call to `Write()` is actually not necessary since we want contention when going into the merging / queuing, but the second barrier prevents threads that exit merging early from making further progress. With *only one barrier* before the call to `TBufferMergerFile::Write()` the version without any queuing is consistently faster at higher thread counts. I think this supports my hypothesis that things will balance out automagically.

Energy Efficiency,"> So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Sorry, but no, this is not acceptable if you ask me. In fact, the need for a patched zeromq raises a big red flag as that may make it not possible to ever use a system version of zeromq if your pull request gets stuck. I agree with Axel that the right course of action is to add the needed functionality to zeromq directly first, then add this work to ROOT. I don't think that time constraints should be used as a way to get hackish code into ROOT. Alternatively, if your addition is really independent to zeromq, you could just add it to the RooFitZMQ library instead, so that you can use the system version of zeromq as is. If in a later version they add your new functionality, you can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. If RooFitZMQ only makes sense as a support library for RooFit::MultiProcess, it's better to put them together in a single pull request.

Note that the loading of the pcm files is mmap-ed and is a no-op. The problem is that some sections of the PCMs are not lazy and they are eagerly deserialized. Using a PCH won't make the things much better since the PCH still deserializes eagerly some sections. That is, the deficiency is not in ROOT but in Clang itself.

Ok I've just run this demo, thanks for pointing me to it, and yes I confirm with my fix the titles disappear. But that was only because an offset of ""5"" was now too big, so I reduced it to ""1"" and they reappear. But I see now that the way they reappear for the x-axis is great but for the y-axis they depended on the height of the pad, so I concede that the fix as it stands isn't going to giver desirable behaviour. I think what I was trying to achieve here was a title offset that scales sensibly with the label offset, so that you dont have to tune the title offset for each pad size you work with. For example, if I take the histogram from the example and plot it to its own canvas in current ROOT, suddenly the offset of 5 is way too big and the titles disappear. I tried the following which seems to work well. ```; charheight /= (gPad->GetWh()*((x1==x0) ? gPad->GetAbsWNDC() : gPad->GetAbsHNDC()));; ```. With this change, and making the titleoffsets in the example=1, things look pretty, and also if I plot the histogram to its own canvas the same offsets then things still look good. . See the attached screenshot. The plots on the left are existing ROOT and note the title offsets are 5 in both cases, so ok for top left but no good for bottom left.

In any case, I am not a thread expert, so if there is a better solution, I would be happy to try it instead of the current attempt with CPU affinity. Just as a side note, for my application, I do not need highly parallel tasks, I just need two threads (one for the GUI, one for the DAQ).

Energy Efficiency,@albert-github thanks for trying out the ROOT documentation. You need root installed to make the ROOT documentation because ROOT documentation uses a filter to create on the fly the picture for all code examples we expose and also to generate the graph of libraries needed by a given class. So to make ROOT do:. - `clone https://github.com/root-project/root.git`; - `mkdir rootbuild`; - `cd rootbuild`; - `cmake ../root`; - `make -j8`; - `source bin/thisroot.sh` // this defines the $ROOTSYS environment variables and more...; - cd ../root/documentation/doxygen; - Edit Doxyfile to reduce the number of paths in the `INPUT` variable otherwise it will take a day. Keep `../../io/io` for instance ; - `make -j8` // this will creat `~/rootdoc`. Open `~rootdoc/html/index.html`; ; We have also [this page](https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/) on our web site which tells a bit the same. Thanks for pointing the wrong page.

Energy Efficiency,"@amadio thanks for the comments. How this solves the CMS problem is illustrated by the example callback I included. That wraps the merge operation with an `std::promise()`, does a `task_arena::enqueue()` with that functor to the existing CMS framework TBB task arena, and then waits for the promise to complete. `task_arena::enqueue()` guarantees that the functor is executed by an existing member of the arena's thread pool. If the calling thread is not part of the arena, it cannot join it, so it cannot execute the functor itself. AFAICT, `task_arena::enqueue()` is the only interface that guarantees this; with other interfaces like `task_arena::execute()` or `task_group::run()`, the calling thread can temporarily join the arena, which would violate our framework's scheduling assumptions. wrt the interface change, my previous version added a second callback instead of modifying the existing one. From a functionality standpoint, the wrapper callback is a superset of the completion callback, but I do see the virtue of keeping the completion callback safe and having a separate callback for the riskier operation of wrapping the merge. I can certainly make that change if that would be more acceptable. I initially tried to do this with the `TTaskGroup`; unfortunately, with a `TTaskGroup` the calling thread can end up temporarily joining the task arena, which wasn't acceptable to us. It seems we have to use `task_arena::execute()`, which requires access to the framework task arena, which is how I ended using a callback for this. Let me know if separating the merge wrapper into a second callback would be acceptable.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1706#issuecomment-371486460:772,schedul,scheduling,772,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1706#issuecomment-371486460,1,['schedul'],['scheduling']

Energy Efficiency,"@dpiparo @bbockelm ,. Hi Danilo,. Based on current cache replacement policy, the cache will be invalidated (set fIsTransferred to kFALSE) immediately once the first event miss occurs. In my current implementation, each task monitors fIsTransferred and return immediately without doing actual unzipping work. But we still need to create tasks corresponding to the number of baskets. I am wondering if we should add task_group.cancel() function into TTaskGroup interface? In that case, the main thread only needs to cancel all tasks once the cache is invalid. . With event simulation benchmark, I did not see too much difference between task_group wait and cancel.
