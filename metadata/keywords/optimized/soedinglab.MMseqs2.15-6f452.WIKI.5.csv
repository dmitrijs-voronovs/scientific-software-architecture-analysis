Performance,"tabases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping similar sequences into clusters. It takes the similarity graph generated from the comparison of a sequence set with itself in the prefiltering or alignment modules as its input. Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set. We use MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the UniProtKB database, which have been clustered down to a 30% sequence similarity threshold. This database is accessible at uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System requirements; MMseqs2 is compatible with modern UNIX-based operating systems and has been thoroughly tested on Linux and macOS. While we do provide a version of MMseqs2 for Windows, we recommend that users utilize the Linux version through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for the best performance and stability.; MMseqs2 utilizes OpenMP to enable multi-core processing and takes advantage of the SIMD capabilities of the host system. For optimal performance, we recommend a system with the AVX2 instruction set, although MMseqs2 can also run on systems with SSE4.1 or even SSE2. Additionally, MMseqs2 is compatible with the PPC64LE and ARM64 processor architectures, which require support for the AltiVec and NEON SIMD instruction sets, respectively.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may require a significant amount of main memory (see section memory requirements). To address this issue, we offer an option for limiting memory usage at the expense of longer runtimes. The database is split into chunks, with the program only retaining one chunk in memory at a time (see Database splitting runtime slowdown). If clustering large databases containing tens of millions of sequences, ensure that you have suffici",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:8963,perform,performance,8963,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['perform'],['performance']

Now we should be able to use the internal clustering (greedy incremental, connected component, set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; It is crucial for single query set searches that the target database resides in main memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins.

It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions. (1) Load the index; into main memory using the module touchdb, MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory; database by using the paramter --db-load-mode 3.

You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ..

Performance,"the most important once:. -s controls how many similar k-mers should be produced during the seeding stage. This is the most important parameter for speed, a lower value is fast but less senstive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off the similar k-mers and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: 0). --max-accapet controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-reject aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit got accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the search. (Default: 1). --db-load-mode controls the behaviour how the database is loaded into memory, the main considertions It make sense to consider switching from. The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches.

Performance,"time-consuming k-mer matching and gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it reduces the memory required on each server to (7 × N L/#chunks) byte + (a^k × 8) byte and allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers, chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of memory).; Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the -DHAVE_MPI=1 flag (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..). Our precompiled static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI.; To search with multiple server call the search workflow with the MPI command exported in the RUNNER environment variable. The databases and temporary folder have to be shared between all nodes (e.g. through NFS):; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases a",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/10fbc856f114928c6314673a2565b6d3c400f9d8.html:5437,scalab,scalability,5437,Home/10fbc856f114928c6314673a2565b6d3c400f9d8.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/10fbc856f114928c6314673a2565b6d3c400f9d8.html,4,['scalab'],['scalability']

Performance,"to perform a single step clustering using --single-step-clustering.; Cascaded clustering has many advantages but comes with one caveat. Since the representative of a cluster can change with every iteration it can happen that some members that were already close to a clustering do not fulfill the clustering criteria anymore. However, we can correct this by reassigning the sequences. To activate the reassignment use --cluster-reassign. This mode removes sequences from the cascaded cluster result that do not fulfill the cluster criteria and reassigns them (if possible) to a different cluster.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transform the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, each vertex (i.e. node) represents a sequence, which is connected to other sequences by edges. An edge between a pair of sequences is introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; The Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover. Greedy set cover works by iteratively selecting the node with most connections and all its connected nodes to form a cluster and repeating until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs l",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:49921,optimiz,optimization,49921,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,3,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"uld be able to use the internal clustering (greedy incremental, connected component, set cover) algorithm of MMseqs2; mmseqs clust sequence result clu. How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single querys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules.

Performance,"ys fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx. Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore we turned of compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; How to build you",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f93ad2e360d0c5dc8ffeaf6fb605f7b0c4c3e100.html:103831,load,load-mode,103831,Home/f93ad2e360d0c5dc8ffeaf6fb605f7b0c4c3e100.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f93ad2e360d0c5dc8ffeaf6fb605f7b0c4c3e100.html,35,['load'],['load-mode']

Safety," best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. We use TANTAN with a threshold of 90% probability for low complexity. Masking can be controlled with --mask.; How to extract representative sequences from a clustering; To extract the representative of a clustering use the following commands:; mmseqs result2repseq sequenceDB clu clu_rep; mmseqs result2flat sequenceDB sequenceDB clu_rep clu_rep.fasta --use-fasta-header. How to redundancy filter sequences with identical length and 100% length overlap.; To redundancy filter sequences of identical length and 100% overlap; mmseqs clusthash can be used. It reduces each sequence to a; five-letter alphabet, computes a 64 bit CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Example: cluster sequences at 90% sequence identity; mmseqs clusthash sequenceDB resultDB --min-seq-id 0.9; mmseqs clust sequenceDB resultDB clusterDB. How to add sequence identities and other alignment information to a clustering result.; We can add sequence identities and other alignment information to the; clustering result outDB by running an additional align step:; $ mmseqs align sequenceDB sequenceDB resultDB alignDB -a; $ mmseqs createtsv sequenceDB sequenceDB alignDB align.tsv .

Safety," not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""search"", search, &par.searchworkflow, COMMAND_MAIN,; ""Search with query sequence or profile DB (iteratively) through target sequence DB"",; ""Searches with the sequences or profiles query DB through the target sequence DB by running the prefilter tool and the align tool for Smith-Waterman alignment.

It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly.

First we pre-computed a index table for the target database; which contains for each possible k-mer the list of the target; sequences and positions where the k-mer occurs. Query; sequences/profiles are processed one by one. For each overlapping,; spaced query k-mer, a list of all similar k-mers is generated. The; similarity threshold determines the list length and sets the trade-off; between speed and sensitivity. For each similar k-mer we look up the; list of sequences and positions where it occurs. As last step we detect; consecutive double matches on the same diagonals.; For each consecutive k-mer matches an ungapped alignment is computed.; Only the maximal ungapped alignment score for each target is reported.; The sensitivity of the prefiltering can be set using the -s option.; Internally, -s sets the average length of the lists of similar; k-mers per query sequence position.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id.

We recommend to use an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS). It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than do not precompute the index.

In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with the [ffindex] database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which the alphanumerical key string corresponds to the file name; and the file content corresponds to the data_record.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line the key and, separated by a tab, the offset in bytes; of the start of the corresponding data_record,; counted from the start of the data file.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12.

Safety,"; on multiple cores and servers, making it highly scalable.; MMseqs2 matches the sensitivity of BLAST, but with several orders of magnitude faster speed. It can perform profile searches, like PSI-BLAST, but with a speed advantage of up to 400 times faster.; While MMseqs2 includes many more modules, the prefiltering and alignment modules are the core modules that underpin its algorithm. The prefiltering module performs a rapid and sensitive double consecutive k-mer matching-based calculation of similarities between sequences in a query database and a target database, followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module then performs a vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of sequences that pass a cut-off score in the prefiltering module. Both modules are parallelized to use all available computer cores, resulting in a highly efficient software suite. With its combination of sensitivity and speed, MMseqs2 can effectively search predicted ORFs in vast metagenomics datasets against the entire UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping similar sequences into clusters. It takes the similarity graph generated from the comparison of a sequence set with itself in the prefiltering or alignment modules as its input. Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set. We use MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the UniProtKB database, which have been clustered down to a 30% sequence similarity threshold.

The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (≈500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with a database format similar to the ffindex; databases. The format was developed to avoid drastically slowing down; the file system when millions of files need to be written and accessed.; ffindex hides the single files from the file system by storing them as; unstructured data records in a single huge binary data file. In; addition to this data file, an ffindex database includes a secondary; file: This index file stores for each entry as tab separated line with; an unique accession code, the start position in bytes of the data record; in the ffindex data file, and a record length.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12.

Common questions; This section describes common questions.; How to set the right alignment coverage to cluster; MMseqs has two modes to control the coverage.; (1) -c only sequences are clustered that have a sequence length overlap greater than x% of the longer of the two sequences. This coverage mode should be used to cluster full length protein sequences. The multi domain structure of proteins will be most likely preserved when using a coverage > 80%.; For example:; q: MAVGTACRPA; t: -AVGTAC---. The coverage of would be 6/10=60%; q: -AVGTAC---; t: MAVGTACRPA. The coverage of would be 6/10=60%; (2) --target-cov only sequences are clustered that have a sequence length overlap greater than x% of the target sequence. The target-cov can be used to cluster fragments protein fragments. When using --target-cov. To avoid that fragments might become representative sequence it is recommended to use --cluster-mode 2.; For example:; q: MAVGTACRPA; t: -AVGTAC---. The target coverage would be 6/6=100%; q: -AVGTAC---; t: MAVGTACRPA. The target coverage would be 6/10=60%; How is MMseqs computing the sequence identity; There are two ways MMseqs can compute the sequence identity.; (1) the default is based on the local alignment score divided by the maximum length of the two aligned sequence segments; (see Figure 2 supplement ""kClust: fast and sensitive clustering of large protein sequence databases”); (2) the fraction of identical residues in the alignment relative to the number of aligned columns including gaps. This option is only activated while using --alignment-mode 3.; Both measures produces very similar results.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs an",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/011bea942298981a5a2c83ab10cf3ead4778afba.html:46389,avoid,avoid,46389,Home/011bea942298981a5a2c83ab10cf3ead4778afba.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/011bea942298981a5a2c83ab10cf3ead4778afba.html,20,['avoid'],['avoid']

This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage.

Safety,"anged.; How to control the speed of the search; There are several parameters to improve the search speed. Here is a list of the most important ones:. -s controls how many similar k-mers should be produced during the seeding stage. This is the most important parameter for speed, a lower value is fast but less sensitive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off similar k-mer generation and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: false). --max-accept controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7.

To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

Safety,"ation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated search with nucleotide databases on either query and target or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX (respectively). The search uses the module extractorfs to detect all open reading frames (orfs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. As default MMseqs2 extracts all orfs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs --orf-start-mode 1 that are longer 30 amino acids (--min-length 30). All orfs are translated by translatenucs using the canonical translation table --translation-table 1. After the protein/protein search all alignments will be offseted to the respective nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search create your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome ; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins. A nucleotide/protein (BLASTX) search can be triggered using the nucleotide database on the query database side.; mmseqs search ecoli_genome ecoli_proteins alnDB tmp.

Mapping Very Similar Sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database.

In this case, the prefiltering program call is:; $ mmseqs prefilter queryDB targetDB resultDB_pref . MMseqs2 can handle profiles or protein/nucleotide sequences as input for the; queryDB. The prefilter k-mer match stage is key to the high speed and; sensitivity. It detects consecutive short words (""k-mer"") match on the same diagonal. The diagonal of a k-mer match is the difference between the positions of the two similar ''k''-mer in the query and in the target sequence.; The pre-computed index table for the target database (blue frame) contains for each possible ''k''-mer the list of the target sequences and positions where the k-mer occurs (green frame).; Query sequences/profiles are processed one by one (loop 1). For each overlapping, spaced query k-mer (loop 2), a list of all similar k-mer is generated (orange frame). The similarity threshold determines the list length and sets the trade-off between speed and sensitivity. The similar k-mer list length can be controlled with -s.; For each similar k-mer (loop 3) we look up the list of sequences and positions where it occurs (green frame). In loop 4 we detect consecutive double matches on the same diagonals (magenta and black frames).; For each consecutive k-mer matches an ungapped alignment is computed.; Only the maximal ungap",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/0e70471c9749a4c6fd352fb0d364e67ada9f1789.html:41952,detect,detects,41952,Home/0e70471c9749a4c6fd352fb0d364e67ada9f1789.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/0e70471c9749a4c6fd352fb0d364e67ada9f1789.html,56,['detect'],['detects']

Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome ; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta. Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generate five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 65535 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the targetDB is computed for a; fast read-in. It is recommended to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp. This call will create a targetDB.idx file.

Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage.

Masking can be controlled with --mask.; How to redundancy filter sequences with identical length and 100% length overlap.; To redundancy filter sequences of identical length and 100% overlap; mmseqs clusthash can be used. It reduces each sequence to a; five-letter alphabet, computes a 64 bit CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Example: cluster sequences at 90% sequence identity; mmseqs clusthash sequenceDB resultDB --min-seq-id 0.9; mmseqs clust sequenceDB resultDB clusterDB.

(1) Load the index; into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory; database by using the paramter --db-load-mode 3. (2) Do not create an; index, MMseqs2 will compute an index on the fly this reduces the IO; volume by roughly a factor of seven.; More details to the underlying search algorithm can be found here:; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search create your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome ; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; Each line of the index file contains, separated by tabs, (1) the ID, (2) the offset in bytes of the data_record; counted from the start of the data file, and; (3) the size of the data record. The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSLDIRL\0GTLKRLSAHYTPAW\0AEAIFIHEG\0YTHGAGFDNDI\0.

In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. We use TANTAN with a threshold of 90% probability for low complexity. Masking can be controlled with --mask. Within iterative-profile searches, profiles are also masked at every search iteration. This behavior can be controlled with --mask-profile.; How to redundancy filter sequences with identical length and 100% length overlap; To redundancy filter sequences of identical length and 100% overlap; mmseqs clusthash can be used. It reduces each sequence to a; five-letter alphabet, computes a 64 bit CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Example: cluster sequences at 90% sequence identity; mmseqs clusthash sequenceDB resultDB --min-seq-id 0.9; mmseqs clust sequenceDB resultDB clusterDB.

This option is only activated while using --alignment-mode 3.; Both measures produces very similar results.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1.

MMseqs2 databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; Each line of the index file contains, separated by tabs, (1) the ID, (2) the offset in bytes of the data_record; counted from the start of the data file, and; (3) the size of the data record. The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSLDIRL\0GTLKRLSAHYTPAW\0AEAIFIHEG\0YTHGAGFDNDI\0.

Safety,"es using mmseqs prefilter, and the important parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Translated Sequence Searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search create your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome ; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins. A nucleotide/protein (BLASTX) search can be triggered using the nucleotide database on the query database side.; mmseqs search ecoli_genome ecoli_proteins alnDB tmp.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step.

Safety,"l. It is possible to use MSAs in FASTA, A3M and CA3M format. In default the first sequence in the MSA is chosen as the query sequence. Gap columns in the query are discarded. But it is also possible to compute a consensus query sequence from the MSA by; mmseqs convertmsa stockholm.msa msaDb; mmseqs msa2profile msaDb profileDB . The msa2profile decide if a column of the multiple sequence alignment will be considered in the profile or not. There are two different modes. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented.; By default, MMseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns of the first sequence except gaps '-' will be turned into profile columns.; This setting can be used for center star MSAs where the first sequence is the center. It is risky for large MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire MSA.; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment).; If you want to use the Pfam database see How to create a target profile database (from PFAM).; msa2profile generates also two additional sequences databases:. profileDB_consensus contains consensus sequences generated by taking the highest scoring amino acid in each profile position. profileDB_seed contains the representative (= first) sequence of each alignment. Convert HHsuite HMMs into a profile; It is possible to convert the HH-suite HMM format to MMseqs2 profiles with the convertprofiledb.

Safety,"mmend to use MMseqs2 workflows and modules directly.; Searching; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB. You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 65535 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the targetDB is computed for a; fast read in. It is recommend to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; $ mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp. This call will create a targetDB.idx file. It is just possible to have one index per database.; Then generate a directory for temporary files. MMseqs2 can produce a; high IO on the file system. It is recommended to create this temporary; folder on a local drive.; $ mkdir tmp. Please ensure that in case of large input databases tmp provides; enough free space.

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Safety,"not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);.

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

Safety,"o not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""search"", search, &par.searchworkflow, COMMAND_MAIN,; ""Search with query sequence or profile DB (iteratively) through target sequence DB"",; ""Searches with the sequences or profiles query DB through the target sequence DB by running the prefilter tool and the align tool for Smith-Waterman alignment.

Safety,"on/run_regression.sh full-path-to-mmseqs-binary intermediate-files-scratch-directory. It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

Translated sequence searching; The search workflow can perform translated searches with nucleotide databases on either query or target, or both sides. It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30). All ORFs are translated by the translatenucs module using the canonical translation table (--translation-table 1). After the protein-protein search all alignments will be offset to the original nucleotide corrdinates by the offsetalignment module.; To perform a translated search, first prepare your database using createdb. It can automatically detect if the input are amino acids or nucleotides.; mmseqs createdb ecoli.fna ecoli_genome; mmseqs createdb ecoli.faa ecoli_proteins.

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also  270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set.

Safety,"rameters are changed.; How to control the speed of the search; There are several parameters to improve the search speed. Here is a list of the most important once:. -s controls how many similar k-mers should be produced during the seeding stage. This is the most important parameter for speed, a lower value is fast but less senstive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off the similar k-mers and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: 0). --max-accapet controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-reject aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit got accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the search. (Default: 1). --db-load-mode controls the behaviour how the database is loaded into memory, the main considertions It make sense to consider switching from. The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the fol",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/ef21d5b8a3a667782c006babeb8ab9ff65ac188e.html:90127,redund,redundant,90127,Home/ef21d5b8a3a667782c006babeb8ab9ff65ac188e.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/ef21d5b8a3a667782c006babeb8ab9ff65ac188e.html,1,['redund'],['redundant']

The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjust with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; –min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; We introduced an extremely fast redundancy filtering preprocessing step; that can cluster sequences of identical length and overlap. It reduces; each sequence to a -letter alphabet, computes a CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Afterwards we begin with three the cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high results significance threshold in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity.

Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modelled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam_msa pfam_profile --match-mode 1. Precompute mmseqs index table (not required for a single search run).; Use the --no-preload flag later in the search, if the query database is small to medium sized. Without that the precomputed index table will be first read completely into memory (unnecessary overhead).; mmseqs createindex pfam_profile tmp -k 5 -s 7.

Write temporary files to local disk when running with MPI; As part of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk. To avoid slowdowns due to this issue, an additional parameter can be passed to search in MPI mode:; --local-tmp /path/on/each/local/server/; Passing this parameter will write the temporary files of each server (created by its cores) on the indicated path (local disk) and reduce the number of temporary files handled on the shared disk.; Frequently Asked Questions; This section describes common questions.; How to set the right alignment coverage to cluster; MMseqs2 has three modes to control the sequence length overlap ""coverage"": (1) bidirectional, (2) target coverage and (3) query coverage. In the context of cluster or linclust, the query is seen representative sequence and target is a member sequence. The --cov-mode flag also automatically sets the --cluster-mode.; (1) With --cov-mode 0 -c [0.0,1.0] only sequences are clustered that have a sequence length overlap greater than X% of the longer of the two sequences. This coverage mode should be used to cluster full length protein sequences. The multi domain structure of proteins will be most likely preserved when using a coverage > 80% (-c 0.8).

In this case, the prefiltering program call is:; $ mmseqs prefilter queryDB targetDB resultDB_pref . MMseqs2 can handle profiles or protein/nucleotide sequences as input for the; queryDB. The prefilter k-mer match stage is key to the high speed and; sensitivity. It detects consecutive short words (""k-mer"") match on the same diagonal. The diagonal of a k-mer match is the difference between the positions of the two similar ''k''-mer in the query and in the target sequence.; The pre-computed index table for the target database (blue frame) contains for each possible ''k''-mer the list of the target sequences and positions where the k-mer occurs (green frame).; Query sequences/profiles are processed one by one (loop 1). For each overlapping, spaced query k-mer (loop 2), a list of all similar k-mer is generated (orange frame). The similarity threshold determines the list length and sets the trade-off between speed and sensitivity. The similar k-mer list length can be controlled with -s.; For each similar k-mer (loop 3) we look up the list of sequences and positions where it occurs (green frame).

MMseqs2 databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file.

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generate five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically.

The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; $ mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp.

This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. We use TANTAN with a threshold of 90% probability for low complexity. Masking can be controlled with --mask.; How to redundancy filter sequences with identical length and 100% length overlap; To redundancy filter sequences of identical length and 100% overlap; mmseqs clusthash can be used. It reduces each sequence to a; five-letter alphabet, computes a 64 bit CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Example: cluster sequences at 90% sequence identity; mmseqs clusthash sequenceDB resultDB --min-seq-id 0.9; mmseqs clust sequenceDB resultDB clusterDB. How to add sequence identities and other alignment information to a clustering result; We can add sequence identities and other alignment information to the; clustering result outDB by running an additional align step:; mmseqs cluster sequenceDB resultDb tmp; mmseqs align sequenceDB sequenceDB resultDb alignDB -a; mmseqs convertalis sequenceDB sequenceDB alignDB align.m8 . The -a parameter computes the whole backtrace. --alignment-mode 3; could be used instead if the backtrace is not needed.

Safety,"t of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

Write temporary files to local disk when running with MPI; As part of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk. To avoid slowdowns due to this issue, an additional parameter can be passed to search in MPI mode:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp --local-tmp /local/hdd/.

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

Security," assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB:; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp; mmseqs createtsv queryDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.tsv. Each line of the result file taxonomyResult.tsv will contain a tab separated list of 1) query accession, 2) LCA NCBI taxon ID, 3) LCA rank name, and 4) LCA scientific name.; The --lca-ranks parameter can be supplied with a comma (,) separated string of taxonomic ranks. For example, --lca-ranks genus,family,order,superkingdom will resolve the respective ranks of the LCA and return a semicolon concatenated string of taxa as the fifth column of the result file.; The taxonomy result can be summarized in a Kraken-style report using the taxonomyreport module.; mmseqs taxonomyreport seqTaxDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult_report.

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also  270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

Security," was tested on Linux; and OSX. Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; MMseqs2 needs uses a lot main memory (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id. Sequences; that are longer than 32768 letters are split. createfasta converts an; MMseqs database to a FASTA formatted text file: the sequence headers contain the; DB identifiers preceded by >, and the sequence is extracted ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html:13692,access,accessed,13692,Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html,3,['access'],['accessed']
