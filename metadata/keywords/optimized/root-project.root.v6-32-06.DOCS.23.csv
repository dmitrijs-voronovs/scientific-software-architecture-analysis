Safety,"uivalent to ""``catch i8* null``"",; because ``filter`` and ``catch`` produce negative and positive selector; values respectively.). - ``cleanup``. - This clause means that the landingpad should always be entered. - C++ front-ends use this for calling objects' destructors. - When this clause is matched, the selector value will be zero. - The runtime may treat ""``cleanup``"" differently from ""``catch <type>; null``"". In C++, if an unhandled exception occurs, the language runtime will call; ``std::terminate()``, but it is implementation-defined whether the runtime; unwinds the stack and calls object destructors first. For example, the GNU; C++ unwinder does not call object destructors when an unhandled exception; occurs. The reason for this is to improve debuggability: it ensures that; ``std::terminate()`` is called from the context of the ``throw``, so that; this context is not lost by unwinding the stack. A runtime will typically; implement this by searching for a matching non-``cleanup`` clause, and; aborting if it does not find one, before entering any landingpad blocks. Once the landing pad has the type info selector, the code branches to the code; for the first catch. The catch then checks the value of the type info selector; against the index of type info for that catch. Since the type info index is not; known until all the type infos have been gathered in the backend, the catch code; must call the `llvm.eh.typeid.for`_ intrinsic to determine the index for a given; type info. If the catch fails to match the selector then control is passed on to; the next catch. Finally, the entry and exit of catch code is bracketed with calls to; ``__cxa_begin_catch`` and ``__cxa_end_catch``. * ``__cxa_begin_catch`` takes an exception structure reference as an argument; and returns the value of the exception object. * ``__cxa_end_catch`` takes no arguments.

Note that the compiler does not guarantee it will not insert stores which clear; the exclusive monitor in between an ``ldrex`` type operation and its paired; ``strex``. In practice this is only usually a risk when the extra store is on; the same cache line as the variable being modified and Clang will only insert; stack stores on its own, so it is best not to use these operations on variables; with automatic storage duration. Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------.

The command line argument strings are decomposed into arguments; (``Arg`` instances). The driver expects to understand all available; options, although there is some facility for just passing certain; classes of options through (like ``-Wl,``). Each argument corresponds to exactly one abstract ``Option``; definition, which describes how the option is parsed along with some; additional metadata. The Arg instances themselves are lightweight and; merely contain enough information for clients to determine which; option they correspond to and their values (if they have additional; parameters). For example, a command line like ""-Ifoo -I foo"" would parse to two; Arg instances (a JoinedArg and a SeparateArg instance), but each; would refer to the same Option. Options are lazily created in order to avoid populating all Option; classes when the driver is loaded. Most of the driver code only needs; to deal with options by their unique ID (e.g., ``options::OPT_I``),. Arg instances themselves do not generally store the values of; parameters. In many cases, this would simply result in creating; unnecessary string copies. Instead, Arg instances are always embedded; inside an ArgList structure, which contains the original vector of; argument strings. Each Arg itself only needs to contain an index into; this vector instead of storing its values directly. The clang driver can dump the results of this stage using the; ``-###`` flag (which must precede any actual command; line arguments).

For editing; operations like this, it interoperates with the :ref:`Twine <dss_twine>`; class.

The Twine class is used as an intermediary datatype for APIs that want to take a; string that can be constructed inline with a series of concatenations. Twine; works by forming recursive instances of the Twine datatype (a simple value; object) on the stack as temporary objects, linking them together into a tree; which is then linearized when the Twine is consumed.

This example forms a string like ""blarg.42"" by concatenating the values; together, and does not form intermediate strings containing ""blarg"" or ""blarg."". Because Twine is constructed with temporary objects on the stack, and because; these instances are destroyed at the end of the current statement, it is an; inherently dangerous API.

LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.takeError();. // Add the module.; if (auto Err = JIT->addIRModule(TheadSafeModule(std::move(M), Ctx))); return Err;. // Look up the JIT'd code entry point.; auto EntrySym = JIT->lookup(""entry"");; if (!EntrySym); return EntrySym.takeError();. // Cast the entry point address to a function pointer.; auto *Entry = EntrySym.getAddress().toPtr<void(*)()>();. // Call into JIT'd code.; Entry();.

In the previous code example with the transformed ``alloc_buf()``, the upper; bound of ``tmp_ptr`` is derived from ``void *__sized_by_or_null(size)``, which; is the return type of ``malloc()``. Hence, the pointer arithmetic doesn't; overflow or ``tmp_ptr`` is null. Therefore, if ``nelems`` was given as a; compile-time constant, the compiler could remove the checks.

Python version and Source Code Formatting; -----------------------------------------. The current minimum version of Python required is documented in the :doc:`GettingStarted`; section. Python code in the LLVM repository should only use language features; available in this version of Python. The Python code within the LLVM repository should adhere to the formatting guidelines; outlined in `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_. For consistency and to limit churn, code should be automatically formatted with; the `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ utility, which is PEP 8 compliant.; Use its default rules. For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:5196,avoid,avoid,5196,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

How is GEP different from ``ptrtoint``, arithmetic, and ``inttoptr``?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. It's very similar; there are only subtle differences. With ptrtoint, you have to pick an integer type. One approach is to pick i64;; this is safe on everything LLVM supports (LLVM internally assumes pointers are; never wider than 64 bits in many places), and the optimizer will actually narrow; the i64 arithmetic down to the actual pointer size on targets which don't; support 64-bit arithmetic in most cases.

It's invalid to take a GEP; from one object, address into a different separately allocated object, and; dereference it. IR producers (front-ends) must follow this rule, and consumers; (optimizers, specifically alias analysis) benefit from being able to rely on; it. See the `Rules`_ section for more information. And, GEP is more concise in common cases. However, for the underlying integer computation implied, there is no; difference. I'm writing a backend for a target which needs custom lowering for GEP. How do I do this?; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. You don't. The integer computation implied by a GEP is target-independent.; Typically what you'll need to do is make your backend pattern-match expressions; trees involving ADD, MUL, etc., which are what GEP is lowered into.

For example, *TFuture<int> = std::async(myfunc,a,b,c);*; - Reintroduced greedy reduction in TProcessExecutor.; - Fix empty chunks in the result vector of TThreadExecutor::Map. If the integer partition of the data in nChunks causes the existence of empty chunks (e.g the—rounded up—division of 12 elements in 5 chunks), the number of chunks is decreased to avoid empty chunks and, as a consequence, accesses to uninitialized memory in the reduction step. ## Language Bindings; - PyROOT now supports list initialisation with tuples. For example, suppose to have a function `void f(const TH1F& h)`. In C++, this can be invoked with this syntax: `f({""name"", ""title"", 64, -4, 4})`. In PyROOT this translates too `f(('name', 'title', 64, -4, 4))`. ## JavaScript ROOT. Upgrade JSROOT to v5.3.1.

MemTagSanitizer follows a; similar implementation strategy, but with the tag storage (shadow); provided by the hardware. A quick overview of MTE hardware capabilities:. * Every 16 aligned bytes of memory can be assigned a 4-bit Allocation Tag.; * Every pointer can have a 4-bit Address Tag that is in its most significant byte.; * Most memory access instructions generate an exception if Address Tag != Allocation Tag.; * Special instructions are provided for fast tag manipulation. Stack instrumentation; =====================. Stack-based memory errors are detected by updating Allocation Tag for; each local variable to a random value at the start of its lifetime,; and resetting it to the stack pointer Address Tag at the end of; it. Unallocated stack space is expected to match the Address Tag of; SP; this allows to skip tagging of any variable when memory safety can; be statically proven. Allocating a truly random tag for each stack variable in a large; function may incur significant code size overhead, because it means; that each variable's address is an independent, non-rematerializable; value; thus a function with N local variables will have extra N live; values to keep through most of its life time. For this reason MemTagSanitizer generates at most one random tag per; function, called a ""base tag"". Other stack variables, if there are; any, are assigned tags at a fixed offset from the base. Please refer to `this document; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/Stack-instrumentation-with-ARM-Memory-Tagging-Extension-(MTE)>`_; for more details about stack instrumentation.

The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); ```. To reset log in the z direction:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); ```. If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the; sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically; propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log; scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); ```. ### WaitPrimitive method. When the `TPad::WaitPrimitive()` method is called with no arguments, it; will wait until a double click or any key pressed is executed in the; canvas. A call to `gSystem->Sleep(10)` has been added in the loop to; avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is convenient when; executing a macro. By adding statements like:. ``` {.cpp}; canvas->WaitPrimitive();; ```. You can monitor the progress of a running macro, stop it at convenient; places with the possibility to interact with the canvas and resume the; execution with a double click or a key press. ### Locking the Pad. You can make the **`TPad`** non-editable. Then no new objects can be; added, and the existing objects and the pad can not be changed with the; mouse or programmatically.

In the future it can be; extended to track other variable properties. E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool. AddressSanitizer may help with this validation. We can instrument all variables; as usual but additionally store stack-safe information in the; ``ASanStackVariableDescription``. Then if AddressSanitizer detects a bug on; a 'safe' variable we can produce an additional report to let the user know that; probably Stack Safety Analysis failed and we should check for a bug in the; compiler.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst:1692,unsafe,unsafe,1692,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,7,"['avoid', 'detect', 'safe', 'unsafe']","['avoid', 'detects', 'safe', 'unsafe']"

Depending on our language we may need to allow a safepoint during the execution; of ``foo``. If so, we need to let the collector update local values in the; current frame. If we don't, we'll be accessing a potential invalid reference; once we eventually return from the call. In this example, we need to relocate the SSA value ``%obj``. Since we can't; actually change the value in the SSA value ``%obj``, we need to introduce a new; SSA value ``%obj.relocated`` which represents the potentially changed value of; ``%obj`` after the safepoint and update any following uses appropriately. The; resulting relocation sequence is:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; %0 = call token (i64, i32, void ()*, i32, i32, ...)* @llvm.experimental.gc.statepoint.p0f_isVoidf(i64 0, i32 0, void ()* @foo, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); %obj.relocated = call coldcc i8 addrspace(1)* @llvm.experimental.gc.relocate.p1i8(token %0, i32 7, i32 7); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj.relocated; }.

Note that the `kOverwrite` option in the; `Write` method overwrites the existing tree. If it is not specified, two; copies of the tree headers are saved. ``` {.cpp}; void tree3AddBranch() {; TFile f(""tree3.root"",""update"");; Float_t new_v;; TTree *t3 = (TTree*)f->Get(""t3"");; TBranch *newBranch = t3-> Branch(""new_v"",&new_v,""new_v/F"");; //read the number of entries in the t3; Int_t nentries = (Int_t)t3->GetEntries();; for (Int_t i = 0; i < nentries; i++){; new_v= gRandom->Gaus(0,1);; newBranch->Fill();; }; t3->Write("""",TObject::kOverwrite); // save only the new version of; // the tree; }; ```. Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only; file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the; new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::AddFriend. A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method.

Safety,"zer does not exist as of Oct 2019. MemTagSanitizer is a fast memory error detector and **a code hardening; tool** based on the Armv8.5-A `Memory Tagging Extension`_. It; detects a similar class of errors as `AddressSanitizer`_ or `HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizer`_, but with; **much** lower overhead. MemTagSanitizer overhead is expected to be in low single digits, both; CPU and memory. There are plans for a debug mode with slightly higher; memory overhead and better diagnostics. The primary use case of; MemTagSanitizer is code hardening in production binaries, where it is; expected to be a strong mitigation for both stack and heap-based; memory bugs. Usage; =====. Compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=memtag`` flag. This; will only work when targeting AArch64 with MemTag extension. One; possible way to achieve that is to add ``-target; aarch64-linux -march=armv8+memtag`` to compilation flags. Implementation; ==============. See `HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizer`_ for a general overview of a; tag-based approach to memory safety. MemTagSanitizer follows a; similar implementation strategy, but with the tag storage (shadow); provided by the hardware. A quick overview of MTE hardware capabilities:. * Every 16 aligned bytes of memory can be assigned a 4-bit Allocation Tag.; * Every pointer can have a 4-bit Address Tag that is in its most significant byte.; * Most memory access instructions generate an exception if Address Tag != Allocation Tag.; * Special instructions are provided for fast tag manipulation. Stack instrumentation; =====================. Stack-based memory errors are detected by updating Allocation Tag for; each local variable to a random value at the start of its lifetime,; and resetting it to the stack pointer Address Tag at the end of; it. Unallocated stack space is expected to match the Address Tag of; SP; this allows to skip tagging of any variable when memory safety can; be statically proven.

Safety,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Of course, this alignment scheme works best if the address points are; in fact aligned correctly. To make this more likely to happen, we insert; padding between virtual tables that in many cases aligns address points to; a power of 2. Specifically, our padding aligns virtual tables to the next; highest power of 2 bytes; because address points for specific base classes; normally appear at fixed offsets within the virtual table, this normally; has the effect of aligning the address points as well. This scheme introduces tradeoffs between decreased space overhead for; instructions and bit vectors and increased overhead in the form of padding. We; therefore limit the amount of padding so that we align to no more than 128; bytes. This number was found experimentally to provide a good tradeoff. Eliminating Bit Vector Checks for All-Ones Bit Vectors; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Dimitar et. al. proposed a novel approach that interleaves virtual tables in [1]_.; This approach is more efficient in terms of space because padding and bit vectors are no longer needed.; At the same time, it is also more efficient in terms of performance because in the interleaved layout; address points of the virtual tables are consecutive, thus the validity check of a virtual; vtable pointer is always a range check. At a high level, the interleaving scheme consists of three steps: 1) split virtual table groups into; separate virtual tables, 2) order virtual tables by a pre-order traversal of the class hierarchy; and 3) interleave virtual tables.

Security," ![ROOT libraries dependencies](pictures/03000005.png). The libraries are designed and organized to minimize dependencies,; such that you can load just enough code for the task at hand rather; than having to load all libraries or one monolithic chunk. The core; library (`libCore.so`) contains the essentials; it is a part of all; ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made; up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes,; operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for; compression of the ROOT files. The Cling library (`libCling.so`) is also needed in all ROOT; applications, and even by `libCore`. A; program referencing only **`TObject`** only needs `libCore`;; `libCling` will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write; ROOT objects one also has to load `libRIO`. As one would expect, none of that; depends on graphics or the GUI. Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether; you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is; defined in a library. #### Linktime Library Dependencies. When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`.

In addition, histograms and trees are automatically deleted when the; current directory is closed. This will automatically take care of the; clean up. See ""Input/Output"". ### Executing a Script From a Script. You may want to execute a script conditionally inside another script.; To do it you need to call the interpreter and you can do that with; `TROOT::ProcessLine()`. The example; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C` calls a script to build the root; file if it does not exist:. ``` {.cpp}; void cernstaff() {; if (gSystem->AccessPathName(""cernstaff.root"")) {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".x cernbuild.C"");; }; ```. `ProcessLine` takes a parameter, which is a pointer to an `int` or to; a `TInterpreter::EErrorCode` to let you access the interpreter error; code after an attempt to interpret. This will contain the error; as defined in `enum TInterpreter::EErrorCode` with `TInterpreter::kSuccess` being; the value for a successful execution. ### Executing a Script From the Invocation. Instead if starting ROOT and running a script on the prompt you can also pass; it to ROOT in its invocation:. ```; $ root -l -b 'myCode.C(""some String"", 12)'; ```. The exact kind of quoting depends on your shell; the one shown here works for; bash-like shells. ROOT can evaluate any expression as part of the invocation; another version of; the previous example can be spelled like this:. ```; $ root -l -b -e 'gROOT->ProcessLine("".x myCode.C(\""some String\"", 12)"");'; ```. ## C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting. In the next example, we demonstrate three of the most important; extensions ROOT and Cling make to C++.

The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support for two fixed; ranges of virtual addresses (the private and local apertures), that are; outside the range of addressable global memory, to map from a flat address to; a private or local address. This uses FLAT instructions that can take a flat; address and access global, private (scratch), and group (LDS) memory depending; on if the address is within one of the aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and setup in the; kernel prologue (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat; access to LDS requires hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register; setup (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`). To convert between a private or group address space address (termed a segment; address) and a flat address the base address of the corresponding aperture; can be used.

Security," - ``llvm/XRay/InstrumentationMap.h``: A convenient tool for analyzing the; instrumentation map in XRay-instrumented object files and binaries. The; ``extract`` and ``stack`` subcommands uses this particular library. Minimizing Binary Size; ----------------------. XRay supports several different instrumentation points including ``function-entry``,; ``function-exit``, ``custom``, and ``typed`` points. These can be enabled individually; using the ``-fxray-instrumentation-bundle=`` flag. For example if you only wanted to; instrument function entry and custom points you could specify:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument -fxray-instrumentation-bundle=function-entry,custom ... This will omit the other sled types entirely, reducing the binary size. You can also; instrument just a sampled subset of functions using instrumentation groups.; For example, to instrument only a quarter of available functions invoke:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument -fxray-function-groups=4. A subset will be chosen arbitrarily based on a hash of the function name. To sample a; different subset you can specify ``-fxray-selected-function-group=`` with a group number; in the range of 0 to ``xray-function-groups`` - 1. Together these options could be used; to produce multiple binaries with different instrumented subsets. If all you need is; runtime control over which functions are being traced at any given time it is better; to selectively patch and unpatch the individual functions you need using the XRay; Runtime Library's ``__xray_patch_function()`` method. Future Work; ===========. There are a number of ongoing efforts for expanding the toolset building around; the XRay instrumentation system.

Security," - the 16-bit checksum;. This header fits within 8 bytes on all platforms supported, and contributes to a; small overhead for each allocation. The checksum is computed using a CRC32 (made faster with hardware support); of the global secret, the chunk pointer itself, and the 8 bytes of header with; the checksum field zeroed out. It is not intended to be cryptographically; strong. The header is atomically loaded and stored to prevent races. This is important; as two consecutive chunks could belong to different threads. We work on local; copies and use compare-exchange primitives to update the headers in the heap; memory, and avoid any type of double-fetching. Randomness; ----------; Randomness is a critical factor to the additional security provided by the; allocator. The allocator trusts the memory mapping primitives of the OS to; provide pages at (mostly) non-predictable locations in memory, as well as the; binaries to be compiled with ASLR. In the event one of those assumptions is; incorrect, the security will be greatly reduced. Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses). This is done in the deallocation path,; and several options exist to tune this behavior. Usage; =====.

Register Bank; -------------. A Register Bank is a set of register classes defined by the target. This; definition is rather loose so let's talk about what they can achieve. Suppose we have a processor that has two register files, A and B. These are; equal in every way and support the same instructions for the same cost. They're; just physically stored apart and each instruction can only access registers from; A or B but never a mix of the two. If we want to perform an operation on data; that's in split between the two register files, we must first copy all the data; into a single register file. Given a processor like this, we would benefit from clustering related data; together into one register file so that we minimize the cost of copying data; back and forth to satisfy the (possibly conflicting) requirements of all the; instructions. Register Banks are a means to constrain the register allocator to; use a particular register file for a virtual register. In practice, register files A and B are rarely equal. They can typically store; the same data but there's usually some restrictions on what operations you can; do on each register file. A fairly common pattern is for one of them to be; accessible to integer operations and the other accessible to floating point; operations.

The *parameter area* is used to store arguments being passed to a callee; function. Following the PowerPC ABI, the first few arguments are actually; passed in registers, with the space in the parameter area unused. However, if; there are not enough registers or the callee is a thunk or vararg function,; these register arguments can be spilled into the parameter area. Thus, the; parameter area must be large enough to store all the parameters for the largest; call sequence made by the caller. The size must also be minimally large enough; to spill registers r3-r10. This allows callees blind to the call signature,; such as thunks and vararg functions, enough space to cache the argument; registers. Therefore, the parameter area is minimally 32 bytes (64 bytes in 64; bit mode.) Also note that since the parameter area is a fixed offset from the; top of the frame, that a callee can access its split arguments using fixed; offsets from the stack pointer (or base pointer.). Combining the information about the linkage, parameter areas and alignment. A; stack frame is minimally 64 bytes in 32 bit mode and 128 bytes in 64 bit mode. The *dynamic area* starts out as size zero. If a function uses dynamic alloca; then space is added to the stack, the linkage and parameter areas are shifted to; top of stack, and the new space is available immediately below the linkage and; parameter areas. The cost of shifting the linkage and parameter areas is minor; since only the link value needs to be copied. The link value can be easily; fetched by adding the original frame size to the base pointer. Note that; allocations in the dynamic space need to observe 16 byte alignment. The *locals area* is where the llvm compiler reserves space for local variables. The *saved registers area* is where the llvm compiler spills callee saved; registers on entry to the callee.

The YAML syntax supports tags as a way to specify the type of a node before; it is parsed. This allows dynamic types of nodes. But the YAML I/O model uses; static typing, so there are limits to how you can use tags with the YAML I/O; model. Recently, we added support to YAML I/O for checking/setting the optional; tag on a map. Using this functionality it is even possible to support different; mappings, as long as they are convertible. To check a tag, inside your mapping() method you can use io.mapTag() to specify; what the tag should be. This will also add that tag when writing yaml. Validation; ----------. Sometimes in a YAML map, each key/value pair is valid, but the combination is; not. This is similar to something having no syntax errors, but still having; semantic errors. To support semantic level checking, YAML I/O allows; an optional ``validate()`` method in a MappingTraits template specialization. When parsing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is call *after* all key/values in; the map have been processed. Any error message returned by the ``validate()``; method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed.; When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML; key/values are written. Any error during output will trigger an ``assert()``; because it is a programming error to have invalid struct values. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {; ...; };. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; ...; }; static std::string validate(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; // Look at all fields in 'stuff' and if there; // are any bad values return a string describing; // the error.

Security," Check `b1` again -- unnecessary!; g();; }; }; }; ```. A checker that finds this pattern syntactically is already implemented in; ClangTidy using AST matchers (`bugprone-redundant-branch-condition`). To implement it using the data flow analysis framework, we can produce a warning; if any part of the branch condition is implied by the flow condition. ```c++; int F(bool b1, bool b2) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (b1) {; // Flow condition: b1.; f();; if (b1 && b2) { // `b1` is implied by the flow condition.; g();; }; }; }; ```. One way to check this implication is to use a SAT solver. Without a SAT solver,; we could keep the flow condition in the CNF form and then it would be easy to; check the implication. ## Example: finding unchecked `std::optional` unwraps. Calling `optional::value()` is only valid if `optional::has_value()` is true. We; want to show that when `x.value()` is executed, the flow condition implies; `x.has_value()`. In the example below `x.value()` is accessed safely because it is guarded by the; `x.has_value()` check. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. While entering the if branch we deduce that `x.has_value()` is implied by the; flow condition. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> x) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; use(x.value());; }; // Flow condition: true.; }; ```. We also need to prove that `x` is not modified between check and value access.; The modification of `x` may be very subtle:. ```c++; void F(std::optional<int> &x);. void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; unknown_function(x); // may change x.; // Flow condition: true.; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead code behind A/B experiment flags.

Note that each type of vector is constructed by passing its coordinate; representation, so a **`XYZTVector`**`(1,2,3,4)` is different from a; `PtEtaPhiEVector(1,2,3,4)`. In addition, the Vector classes can be; constructed by any vector, which implements the accessors `x()`, `y()`,; `z()` and `t()`.

When a; pass is run if the pass may be skipped, it should call the OptBisect object to; see if it should be skipped. The OptBisect object is intended to be accessed through LLVMContext and each; Pass base class contains a helper function that abstracts the details in order; to make this check uniform across all passes. These helper functions are:. .. code-block:: c++. bool ModulePass::skipModule(Module &M);; bool CallGraphSCCPass::skipSCC(CallGraphSCC &SCC);; bool FunctionPass::skipFunction(const Function &F);; bool LoopPass::skipLoop(const Loop *L);. A MachineFunctionPass should use FunctionPass::skipFunction() as such:. .. code-block:: c++. bool MyMachineFunctionPass::runOnMachineFunction(Function &MF) {; if (skipFunction(*MF.getFunction()); return false;; // Otherwise, run the pass normally.; }. In addition to checking with the OptBisect class to see if the pass should be; skipped, the skipFunction(), skipLoop() and skipBasicBlock() helper functions; also look for the presence of the ""optnone"" function attribute.

By default, ROOT now falls back to the built-in version of xrootd if it can't find it in the system.; This means that passing `-Dbuiltin_xrootd=ON` is not necessary anymore to build ROOT with xrootd support.; Note that built-in xrootd requires a working network connection. ### Experimental address sanitizer build configuration; Added a build flag `asan` that switches on address sanitizer. It's experimental, so expect problems. For example, when building with gcc,; manipulations in global variables in llvm will abort the build. Such checks can be disabled using environment variables. Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation. Even more includes will be ""hidden"" when ROOT configured with `-Ddev=ON` build option.; In that case ROOT uses `#ifdef R__LESS_INCLUDES` to replace unused includes by class forward declarations.; Such `dev` builds can be used to verify that ROOT-based code really inc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:8153,sanitiz,sanitizer,8153,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,1,['sanitiz'],['sanitizer']

If an identifier is found, its contents; (macro definitions, flags, top-level declarations, etc.) will be deserialized,; at which point the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo`` structure will have the; same contents it would have after parsing the headers in the AST file. Within the AST file, the identifiers used to name declarations are represented; with an integral value. A separate table provides a mapping from this integral; value (the identifier ID) to the location within the on-disk hash table where; that identifier is stored. This mapping is used when deserializing the name of; a declaration, the identifier of a token, or any other construct in the AST; file that refers to a name. .. _pchinternals-method-pool:. Method Pool Block; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The method pool block is represented as an on-disk hash table that serves two; purposes: it provides a mapping from the names of Objective-C selectors to the; set of Objective-C instance and class methods that have that particular; selector (which is required for semantic analysis in Objective-C) and also; stores all of the selectors used by entities within the AST file. The design; of the method pool is similar to that of the :ref:`identifier table; <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the first time a particular selector is formed; during the compilation of the program, Clang will search in the on-disk hash; table of selectors; if found, Clang will read the Objective-C methods; associated",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:19964,hash,hash,19964,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['hash'],['hash']
Security," It is higher performance than global memory. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. **Private**; The private address space uses the hardware scratch memory support which; automatically allocates memory when it creates a wavefront and frees it when; a wavefronts terminates. The memory accessed by a lane of a wavefront for any; given private address will be different to the memory accessed by another lane; of the same or different wavefront for the same private address. If a kernel dispatch uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory from a; pool of backing memory allocated by the runtime for each wavefront. The lanes; of the wavefront access this using dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping; used from private address to backing memory address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; ((private-address / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address % 4)``. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the same private address, the; interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed and hence requires; fewer cache lines to be fetched. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is; determined by a wavefront (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). Scratch memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer; instructions with the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch; offset, by the scratch instructions, or by flat instructions. Multi-dword; access is not supported except by flat and scratch instructions in; GFX9-GFX11. Code that manipulates the stack values in other lanes of a wavefront,; such as by ``addrspacecast``-ing stack pointers to generic ones and taking offsets; that reach other lanes or by explicitly constructing the scratch buffer descriptor,; triggers undefined behavior when it modifies the scratch values of other lanes.; The compiler may assume that such modifications do not occur.; When using code object V5 ``LIBOMPTARGET_STACK_SIZE`` may be used to pro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst:27333,access,accesses,27333,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,2,['access'],"['accessed', 'accesses']"

The meaning of the thread-local storage address TA is defined by the; run-time environment. If the run-time environment supports multiple; thread-local storage blocks for a single thread, then the block; corresponding to the executable or shared library containing this DWARF; expression is used. *Some implementations of C, C++, Fortran, and other languages, support a; thread-local storage class. Variables with this storage class have distinct; values and addresses in distinct threads, much as automatic variables have; distinct values and addresses in each subprogram invocation. Typically,; there is a single block of storage containing all thread-local variables; declared in the main executable, and a separate block for the variables; declared in each shared library. Each thread-local variable can then be; accessed in its block using an identifier. This identifier is typically a; byte offset into the block and pushed onto the DWARF stack by one of the*; ``DW_OP_const*`` *operations prior to the* ``DW_OP_form_tls_address``; *operation.

Its layout and usage are defined by the shader compiler.

Security," The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`).

The store to ``%a`` is clearly not a clobber for the store to ``%b``. It would; be the walker's goal to figure this out, and return ``liveOnEntry`` when queried; for the clobber of ``MemoryAccess`` ``2``. By default, ``MemorySSA`` provides a walker that can optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s; and ``MemoryUse``\ s by consulting whatever alias analysis stack you happen to; be using. Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``.

Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1.

For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you. It will print a message letting you know how to reproduce the; resulting error. The :doc:`OptBisect <OptBisect>` page shows an alternative method for finding; incorrect optimization passes.

Security," `b1` is implied by the flow condition.; g();; }; }; }; ```. One way to check this implication is to use a SAT solver. Without a SAT solver,; we could keep the flow condition in the CNF form and then it would be easy to; check the implication. ## Example: finding unchecked `std::optional` unwraps. Calling `optional::value()` is only valid if `optional::has_value()` is true. We; want to show that when `x.value()` is executed, the flow condition implies; `x.has_value()`. In the example below `x.value()` is accessed safely because it is guarded by the; `x.has_value()` check. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. While entering the if branch we deduce that `x.has_value()` is implied by the; flow condition. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> x) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; use(x.value());; }; // Flow condition: true.; }; ```. We also need to prove that `x` is not modified between check and value access.; The modification of `x` may be very subtle:. ```c++; void F(std::optional<int> &x);. void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; unknown_function(x); // may change x.; // Flow condition: true.; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead code behind A/B experiment flags. Finding dead code is a classic application of data flow analysis. Unused flags for A/B experiment hide dead code. However, this flavor of dead; code is invisible to the compiler because the flag can be turned on at any; moment. We could make a tool that deletes experiment flags. The user tells us which flag; they want to delete, and we assume that the it's value is a given constant. For example, the user could use the tool to remove `example_flag` from this; code:. ```c++; DEFINE_FLAG(std::string, example_flag, """", ""A sample flag."");. void Example() {; bool x = GetFlag(FLAGS_example_flag).empty();; f();; if (x)",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:27562,access,access,27562,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['access'],['access']

The advantage of this approach is that doesn't require any special OS support.; The disadvantage is the extra overhead due to additional instructions required; for each counter access (overhead both in terms of binary size and performance); plus duplication of counters (i.e. one copy in the binary itself and another; copy that's mapped into memory).

There is explicitly no compatibility promised between versions of the toolchain, and regular users are strongly advised *not* to make use of experimental extensions before they reach ratification. The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases. Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed. The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending the bi-weekly RISC-V sync-up call is strongly advised. ``experimental-zacas``; LLVM implements the `1.0-rc1 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zacas/releases/tag/v1.0-rc1>`_. ``experimental-zfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfwma``; LLVM implements assembler support for the `1.0.0-rc2 specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bfloat16/releases/tag/v59042fc71c31a9bcb2f1957621c960ed36fac401>`_. ``experimental-zicfilp``, ``experimental-zicfiss``; LLVM implements the `0.4 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/releases/tag/v0.4.0>`__. ``experimental-ztso``; LLVM im",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst:9980,validat,validate,9980,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,1,['validat'],['validate']
Security," access methods. The bin edges are always stored internally; in double precision. You can examine the actual edges / limits of the histogram bins by; accessing the axis parameters, like in the example below:. ``` {.cpp}; const Int_t XBINS = 5; const Int_t YBINS = 5;; Double_t xEdges[XBINS + 1] = {0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0};; Double_t yEdges[YBINS + 1] = {-1.0, -0.4, -0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0};. TH2* h = new TH2D(""h2"", ""h2"", XBINS, xEdges, YBINS, yEdges);; TAxis* xAxis = h->GetXaxis(); TAxis* yAxis = h->GetYaxis();. cout << ""Third bin on Y-dimension: "" << endl; // corresponds to; // [-0.2, 0.5]; cout << ""\tLower edge: "" << yAxis->GetBinLowEdge(3) << endl;; cout << ""\tCenter: "" << yAxis->GetBinCenter(3) << endl;; cout << ""\tUpper edge: "" << yAxis->GetBinUpEdge(3) << endl;; ```. ## Bin Numbering. All histogram types support fixed or variable bin sizes. 2-D; histograms may have fixed size bins along X and variable size bins; along Y or vice-versa. The functions to fill, manipulate, draw, or; access histograms are identical in both cases. ### Convention. For all histogram types: `nbins` , `xlow` , `xup`. Bin\# 0 contains the underflow. Bin\# 1 contains the first bin with low-edge ( `xlow` INCLUDED). The second to last bin (bin\# `nbins`) contains the upper-edge; (`xup` EXCLUDED). The Last bin (bin\# `nbins+1)` contains the overflow. In case of 2-D or 3-D histograms, a ""global bin"" number is defined.; For example, assuming a 3-D histogram `h` with `binx`, `biny`, `binz`,; the function returns a global/linear bin number. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t bin = h->GetBin(binx, biny, binz);; ```. This global bin is useful to access the bin information independently; of the dimension. ### Re-binning; \index{histogram!rebin}. At any time, a histogram can be re-binned via the **`TH1`**`::Rebin()`; method. It returns a new histogram with the re-binned contents. If bin; errors were stored, they are recomputed during the re-binning. ## Filling Histograms.

Therefore, the vector; and scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different; work-groups (which may be executing on different SAs) of an agent can be; reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is; required to ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of; different SAs. It ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed; before executing a subsequent vector memory and so can be used to meet the; requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.; * The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges; of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.; * On GFX10.3 and GFX11 a memory attached last level (MALL) cache exists for GPU memory.; The MALL cache is fully coherent with GPU memory and has no impact on system; coherence. All agents (GPU and CPU) access GPU memory through the MALL cache. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time.

Security," addition `TFitResult` derives from `TNamed` and can be conveniently; stored in a file. When fitting an histogram ( a **`TH1`** object) or a graph (a `TGraph` object) it is possible to return a `TFitResult` via the `TFitResultPtr` object,; which behaves as a smart pointer to a `TFitResult`.; `TFitResultPtr` is the return object by `TH1::Fit` or `TGraph::Fit`.; By default the TFitResultPtr contains only the status of the fit and can be obtained by an automatic conversion of the TFitResultPtr to an integer. If the fit option *`S`* is instead used, `TFitResultPtr` contains the `TFitResult` and behaves as a smart; pointer to it. This is an example:. ``` {.cpp}; int fitStatus = hist->Fit(myFunction); // TFitResultPtr contains only the fit status. TFitResultPtr r = hist->Fit(myFunction,""S""); // TFitResultPtr contains the TFitResult; TMatrixDSym cov = r->GetCovarianceMatrix(); // to access the covariance matrix; Double_t chi2 = r->Chi2(); // to retrieve the fit chi2; Double_t par0 = r->Parameter(0); // retrieve the value for the parameter 0; Double_t err0 = r->ParError(0); // retrieve the error for the parameter 0; r->Print(""V""); // print full information of fit including covariance matrix; r->Write(); // store the result in a file; ```. ## The Minimization packages. As explained before various minimization packages can be used when fitting in ROOT.; We have seen before how to configure the `Fitter` class to use different minimization packages; and different minimization options.; When using the `Fit` method the minimization package (and its options) can be selected using the; static methods of the `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions` class.; For example to select `Minuit2` instead of `Minuit` for fitting an histogram do:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit2"");; // fit the histogram histo with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; ```.

On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information. While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges. A natural way to scale up the existing hand-coded mitigations is simply to; inject an `lfence` instruction into both the target and fallthrough; destinations of every conditional branch. This ensures that no predicate or; bounds check can be bypassed speculatively. However, the performance overhead; of this approach is, simply put, catastrophic. Yet it remains the only truly; ""secure by default"" approach known prior to this effort and serves as the; baseline for performance. One attempt to address the performance overhead of this and make it more; realistic to deploy is [MSVC's /Qspectre; switch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/).; Their technique is to use static analysis within the compiler to only insert; `lfence` instructions into conditional edges at risk ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:44946,attack,attacks,44946,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,"['attack', 'secur']","['attacks', 'security']"

If the; target supports it, it will emit globals in the code model specified,; overriding the code model used to compile the translation unit.; The allowed values are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model.

Security," and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.) These act like keys; or tokens that allow the thread to access a given resource. Just like physical; security keys, a thread cannot make copy of a capability, nor can it destroy; one. A thread can only release a capability to another thread, or acquire one; from another thread. The annotations are deliberately agnostic about the; exact mechanism used to acquire and release capabilities; it assumes that the; underlying implementation (e.g. the Mutex implementation) does the handoff in; an appropriate manner. The set of capabilities that are actually held by a given thread at a given; point in program execution is a run-time concept. The static analysis works; by calculating an approximation of that set, called the *capability; environment*. The capability environment is calculated for every program point,; and describes the set of capabilities that are statically known to be held, or; not held, at that particular point. This environment is a conservative; approximation of the full set of capabilities that will actually held by a; thread at run-time. Reference Guide; ===============.

This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the full; tag interpretation (where the pointer tag is between 1 and `TG-1` and the; last byte of the granule is ordinary data) and the short tag interpretation; (where the pointer tag is stored in the granule).

Security," are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them.

Security," automatic storage duration of that type,; - assigns to an l-value of that type, or; - converts an l-value of that type to an r-value. A program calls for a type to be default-initialized if it:. - declares a variable of that type without an initializer. An expression is ill-formed if calls for a type to be copied,; destroyed, or default-initialized and that type is illegal to; (respectively) copy, destroy, or default-initialize. A program is ill-formed if it contains a function type specifier; with a parameter or return type that is illegal to copy or; destroy. If a function type specifier would be ill-formed for this; reason except that the parameter or return type was incomplete at; that point in the translation unit, the program is ill-formed but; no diagnostic is required. A ``goto`` or ``switch`` is ill-formed if it jumps into the scope of; an object of automatic storage duration whose type is non-trivial to; destroy. C specifies that it is generally undefined behavior to access an l-value; if there is no object of that type at that location. Implementations; are often lenient about this, but non-trivial types generally require; it to be enforced more strictly. The following rules apply:. The *static subobjects* of a type ``T`` at a location ``L`` are:. - an object of type ``T`` spanning from ``L`` to ``L + sizeof(T)``;. - if ``T`` is a struct type, then for each field ``f`` of that struct,; the static subobjects of ``T`` at location ``L + offsetof(T, .f)``; and. - if ``T`` is the array type ``E[N]``, then for each ``i`` satisfying; ``0 <= i < N``, the static subobjects of ``E`` at location; ``L + i * sizeof(E)``.

There is also no need; at runtime for any logic intended to compute human-readable presentation of; information, such as C++ symbol demangling. Instead, logging must include markup; elements that give the contextual information necessary to make sense of the raw; data, such as memory layout details. This format identifies markup elements with a syntax that is both simple and; distinctive. It's simple enough to be matched and parsed with straightforward; code.

Security," both. Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change; during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to; be used. As the constant address space could only be modified on the host; side, a generic pointer loaded from the constant address space is safe to be; assumed as a global pointer since only the device global memory is visible; and managed on the host side. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated; of volatile data before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant; memory to change values between kernel dispatches. **Region**; The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS).

Security," caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid; needing to invalidate the L2 cache.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed; by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to; invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches. Wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of loads and; sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load, atomic with; return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the completion of; store and atomic without return in order.

Security," can add it to the ``LLVM_ALL_TARGETS`` variable; located in the main ``CMakeLists.txt``. Target Machine; ==============. ``LLVMTargetMachine`` is designed as a base class for targets implemented with; the LLVM target-independent code generator. The ``LLVMTargetMachine`` class; should be specialized by a concrete target class that implements the various; virtual methods. ``LLVMTargetMachine`` is defined as a subclass of; ``TargetMachine`` in ``include/llvm/Target/TargetMachine.h``. The; ``TargetMachine`` class implementation (``TargetMachine.cpp``) also processes; numerous command-line options. To create a concrete target-specific subclass of ``LLVMTargetMachine``, start; by copying an existing ``TargetMachine`` class and header. You should name the; files that you create to reflect your specific target. For instance, for the; SPARC target, name the files ``SparcTargetMachine.h`` and; ``SparcTargetMachine.cpp``. For a target machine ``XXX``, the implementation of ``XXXTargetMachine`` must; have access methods to obtain objects that represent target components. These; methods are named ``get*Info``, and are intended to obtain the instruction set; (``getInstrInfo``), register set (``getRegisterInfo``), stack frame layout; (``getFrameInfo``), and similar information. ``XXXTargetMachine`` must also; implement the ``getDataLayout`` method to access an object with target-specific; data characteristics, such as data type size and alignment requirements. For instance, for the SPARC target, the header file ``SparcTargetMachine.h``; declares prototypes for several ``get*Info`` and ``getDataLayout`` methods that; simply return a class member. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {. class Module;. class SparcTargetMachine : public LLVMTargetMachine {; const DataLayout DataLayout; // Calculates type size & alignment; SparcSubtarget Subtarget;; SparcInstrInfo InstrInfo;; TargetFrameInfo FrameInfo;. protected:; virtual const TargetAsmInfo *createTargetAsmInfo() const;. public:; Spar",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst:8849,access,access,8849,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,1,['access'],['access']
Security," can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used). Moreover, while retaining the order of the elements based on their insertion; index, like a vector, iterating over the elements via ``begin()`` and ``end()``; is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``. Finally a ``materialized_begin()`` and ``materialized_end`` iterators are; provided to access the elements associated to the accessed pages, which could; speed up operations that need to iterate over initialized elements in a; non-ordered manner. .. _dss_vector:. <vector>; ^^^^^^^^. ``std::vector<T>`` is well loved and respected. However, ``SmallVector<T, 0>``; is often a better option due to the advantages listed above. std::vector is; still useful when you need to store more than ``UINT32_MAX`` elements or when; interfacing with code that expects vectors :). One worthwhile note about std::vector: avoid code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. for ( ... ) {; std::vector<foo> V;; // make use of V.; }. Instead, write this as:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<foo> V;; for ( ... ) {; // make use of V.; V.clear();; }. Doing so will save (at least) one heap allocation and free per iteration of the; loop. .. _dss_deque:. <deque>; ^^^^^^^. ``std::deque`` is, in some senses, a generalized version of ``std::vector``.; Like ``std::vector``, it provides constant time random access and other similar; properties, but it ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:64490,access,access,64490,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessed']"
Security," can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data. Here is an example,; extracted and simplified from the Project Zero paper:; ```; struct array {; unsigned long length;; unsigned char data[];; };; struct array *arr1 = ...; // small array; struct array *arr2 = ...; // array of size 0x400; unsigned long untrusted_offset_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_offset_from_caller < arr1->length) {; unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset_from_caller];; unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200;; unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];; }; ```. The key of the attack is to call this with `untrusted_offset_from_caller` that; is far outside of the bounds when the branch predictor will predict that it; will be in-bounds. In that case, the body of the `if` will be executed; speculatively, and may read secret data into `value` and leak it via a; cache-timing side channel when a dependent access is made to populate `value2`. ## High Level Mitigation Approach. While several approaches are being actively pursued to mitigate specific; branches and/or loads inside especially risky software (most notably various OS; kernels), these approaches require manual and/or static analysis aided auditing; of code and explicit source changes to apply the mitigation. They are unlikely; to scale well to large applications. We are proposing a comprehensive; mitigation approach that would apply automatically across an entire program; rather than through manual changes to the code. While this is likely to have a; high performance cost, some applications may be in a good position to take this; performance / security tradeoff. The specific technique we propose is to cause loads to be checked using; branchless code to ensure that they are executing along a valid control flow; path.

Security," change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice.

Security," class provides some; member functions that allow you to tune the behavior of objects in; containers. For example, by default two objects are considered equal if; their pointers point to the same address. This might be too strict for; some classes where equality is already achieved if some or all of the; data members are equal. By overriding the following **`TObject`** member; functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. - `IsEqual()`is used by the `FindObject() `collection method. By; default, `IsEqual()` compares the two object pointers. - `Compare()`returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller,; equal or larger than the other object. By default, a **`TObject`**; has not a valid `Compare()` method. - `IsSortable() `returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it; has a valid `Compare(`) method). By default, a **`TObject`** is not; sort able. - `Hash() `returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an; object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique,; like **`THashTable`**, **`THashList`** and **`TMap`**. By default,; `Hash(`) returns the address of the object. It is essential to; choose a good hash function. The example below shows how to use and override these member functions. ``` {.cpp}; class TObjNum : public TObject {; private:; Int_t num; // TObjNum is a simple container for an integer.; public:; TObjNum(Int_t i = 0) : num(i) { }; ~TObjNum() { }; void SetNum(Int_t i) { num = i; }; Int_t GetNum() const { return num; }; void Print(Option_t *) const; { printf(""num = %dn"", num); }; Bool_t IsEqual(TObject *obj) const; { return num == ((TObjNum*)obj)->num; }; Bool_t IsSortable() const { return kTRUE; }; Int_t Compare(const TObject *obj) const; { if (num < ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return -1;; else if (num > ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return 1;; else return 0; }; ULong_t Hash() const { return num; }; };; ```. ## The TIter Generic Iterator.

It should have become clear from these examples how to navigate in such; a multi-dimensional space of variables and unveil relations between; variables using n-tuples. ### Reading N-tuples. For completeness, you find here a small macro to read the data back from; a ROOT n-tuple. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/read_ntuple_from_file.C; ```. The macro shows the easiest way of accessing the content of a n-tuple:; after loading the n-tuple, its branches are assigned to variables and; `GetEntry(long)` automatically fills them with the content for a; specific row. By doing so, the logic for reading the n-tuple and the; code to process it can be split and the source code remains clear. ### Storing Arbitrary N-tuples ###. It is also possible to write n-tuples of arbitrary type by using ROOT's; `TBranch` class. This is especially important as `TNtuple::Fill()`; accepts only floats. The following macro creates the same n-tuple as; before but the branches are booked directly. The `Fill()` function then; fills the current values of the connected variables to the tree. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_ntuple_to_file_advanced.C; ```. The `Branch()` function requires a pointer to a variable and a; definition of the variable type.

JIT-compiling traces of mixed Python/bound C++ code reduces, and in some; cases removes, the overhead of boxing/unboxing native data into their Python; proxies and vice versa.; It can also reduce or remove temporaries, especially for template; expressions.; Thus, there can be significant speedups for mixed code, beyond the Numba; compilation of Python code itself.; The current implementation integrates compiled C++ through function pointers,; object pointers, and pointer offsets, into the intermediate representation; (IR) as generated by Numba.; A future version may integrate Cling-generated IR directly into Numba IR (or; vice versa), e.g. if the C++ code is exposed from (precompiled) headers.; This would allow inlining of C++ code into Numba traces, for further; expected speedups. Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly require a rewrite of the Python code.; Add that Numba, as a JIT-compiler, is fully run-time just like ``cppyy``,; and the use case for integration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.).

Each scalar type has a parent type, which must also; be a scalar type or the TBAA root. Via this parent relation, scalar types; within a TBAA root form a tree. **Struct type descriptors** denote types; that contain a sequence of other type descriptors, at known offsets. These; contained type descriptors can either be struct type descriptors themselves; or scalar type descriptors. **Access tags** are metadata nodes attached to load and store instructions.; Access tags use type descriptors to describe the *location* being accessed; in terms of the type system of the higher level language. Access tags are; tuples consisting of a base type, an access type and an offset. The base; type is a scalar type descriptor or a struct type descriptor, the access; type is a scalar type descriptor, and the offset is a constant integer. The access tag ``(BaseTy, AccessTy, Offset)`` can describe one of two; things:. * If ``BaseTy`` is a struct type, the tag describes a memory access (load; or store) of a value of type ``AccessTy`` contained in the struct type; ``BaseTy`` at offset ``Offset``. * If ``BaseTy`` is a scalar type, ``Offset`` must be 0 and ``BaseTy`` and; ``AccessTy`` must be the same; and the access tag describes a scalar; access with scalar type ``AccessTy``.

Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }.

Doing this may break the ABI if the parameter is not ``__bidi_indexable`` at the; definition of function ``bar()`` which is likely the case because parameters are; ``__single`` by default without an explicit annotation.

The reader can create `RNTupleView` objects for the independent reading of individual fields.; The reader can create `RBulk` objects for bulk reading of individual fields. Additionally, the reader provides access to a cached copy of the descriptor.; It can display individual entries (`RNTupleReader::Show()`) and summary information (`RNTupleReader::PrintInfo()`). ### RNTupleView<T>; RNTuple views provide read access to individual fields.; Views are created from an RNTupleReader.; Views are templated; for simple types (e.g., `float`, `int`), views provide read-only access directly to an RNTuple page in memory.; Complex types and void views require additional memory copies to populate an object in memory from the column data. A view can iterate over the entry range, over the field range, and over the range of a collection within an entry.; For instance, for a field `std::vector<float> pt`, a view can iterate over all `pt` values of all entries, or over the `pt` values of a particular entry. A view can safely outlive its originating reader.; Once the reader is deconstructed, any attempt to read data will throw an exception, but the view is still properly destructed. Views that originate from the same reader _cannot_ be used concurrently by different threads.

A ray-traced view can be `clipped` with any shape known by the modeller.; This means that the region inside the clipping shape is subtracted from; the current drawn geometry (become invisible). In order to activate; clipping, one has to first define the clipping shape(s):. `1. TGeoShape *clip1, *clip2, ...`. One might switch between several clipping shapes. Note that these shapes; are considered defined in the current `MARS`. Composite shapes may be; used. 2`. gGeoManager->SetClippingShape(clip1);`.

Security," dereferenced to read memory. The exception is; ``DW_CFA_val_offset`` which uses the address to set the value of a register. In; order to support address spaces, the CFA DWARF expression is defined to be a; memory location description. This allows it to specify an address space which is; used to convert the offset address back to an address in that address space. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. This approach of extending memory location descriptions to support address; spaces, allows all existing DWARF Version 5 expressions to have the identical; semantics. It allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is; using. For example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a; swizzled manner when mapping a source language thread to the lane of a wavefront; in a SIMT manner. Or a compiler could choose to access it in an unswizzled; manner if mapping the same language with the wavefront being the thread. It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private; memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an; unswizzled manner, while using a swizzled private memory for SIMT variable; access. This approach also allows memory location descriptions for different address; spaces to be combined using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations. Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage. They give freedom to the; consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane; information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory location; description and no extra information. The same set of operations can operate on; locations independent of their kind of storage. The ``DW_OP_deref*`` therefore; can be used on any storage kind, including memory location descriptions of; different address spaces. Therefore, the ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations are; unnecessary, except to become a more compact way to encode a non-default address; space address followe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:22447,access,access,22447,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['access'],['access']

And when we try to model such; typestates (complex in this specific manner, i.e. heap-like) in any checker, we; have a choice between re-doing this modeling in every such checker (which is; something analyzer is indeed good at, but at a price of making checkers heavy); or instead relying on the Store to do exactly what it's designed to do. > I think the key criterion here is: ""is the region accessible from outside; > the library"". That is, does the library expose the region as a pointer that; > can be read to or written from in the client program? If so, then it makes; > sense for this to be in the store: we are modeling reachable storage as; > storage. But if we're just modeling arbitrary analysis facts that need to be; > invalidated when a pointer escapes then we shouldn't try to gin up storage; > for them just to get invalidation for free. As a metaphor, i'd probably compare it to body farms - the difference between; ghost member variables and metadata symbols seems to me like the difference; between body farms and evalCall. Both are nice to have, and body farms are very; pleasant to work with, even if not omnipotent.

If this method does not exist, the TClass will use; a method with the name and signature:. void Reset(Optiont_t *);. TClass now provides a quick access to these merging; function via TClass::GetResetAfterMerge.

The wrapper function should have; the signature/type ROOT::ResetAfterMergeFunc_t:. void (*)(void *thisobj, TFileMergeInfo*);. ResetAfterMerge functions were added to the following classes:; TDirectoryFile, TMemFile, TTree, TChain, TBranch, TBranchElement,; TBranchClones, TBranchObject and TBranchRef. Avoid leaking the inner object in a container like vector<vector<MyClass*> > ; and vector<vector<MyClass*> *> .

It is recommended not to use special symbols in domain or user names. Several users can be add to the "".htdigest"" file. When starting the server, the following arguments should be specified:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name"");; ```. After that, the web browser will automatically request to input a name/password for the domain ""domain_name"". Based on authorized accounts, one could restrict or enable access to some elements in the server objects hierarchy, using `THttpServer::Restrict()` method. For instance, one could hide complete folder from 'guest' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""hidden=guest"");; ```. Or one could hide from all but 'admin' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""visible=admin"");; ```. Hidden folders or objects can not be accessed via http protocol. By default server runs in readonly mode and do not allow methods execution via 'exe.json' or 'exe.bin' requests. To allow such action, one could either grant generic access for all or one could allow to execute only special method:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow=all"");; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow_method=GetTitle"");; ```. One could provide several options for the same item, separating them with '&' sign:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow_method=GetTitle&hide=guest"");; ```.

At any time, one could register other objects with the command:. ```cpp; TGraph* gr = new TGraph(10);; gr->SetName(""gr1"");; serv->Register(""graphs/subfolder"", gr);; ```. One should specify sub-folder name, where objects will be registered.; If sub-folder name does not starts with slash `/`, than top-name folder `/Objects/` will be prepended.; At any time one could unregister objects:. ```cpp; serv->Unregister(gr);; ```. THttpServer does not take ownership over registered objects - they should be deleted by user. If the objects content is changing in the application, one could enable monitoring flag in the browser - then objects view will be regularly updated. ## Accessing file system. THttpServer provides partial access to the files from file system.; First of all, JSROOT scripts and files can be accessed via ""jsrootsys/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs"".; Files from ROOT install directory can be get via ""rootsys/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/rootsys/icons/about.xpm"".; Also files from current directory where ROOT is running can be accessed via ""currentdir/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/currentdir/file.txt"".

Security," function/method; that provides access to some underlying resource. The analysis ensures that; the calling thread cannot access the *resource* (i.e. call the function, or; read/write the data) unless it has the *capability* to do so. Capabilities are associated with named C++ objects which declare specific; methods to acquire and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.)

The global and constant memory spaces both use global virtual addresses, which; are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some virtual; addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible by the GPU,; and some by both. Using the constant memory space indicates that the data will not change during; the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to be; used. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated of volatile data before; each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant memory to change values between; kernel dispatches. The local memory space uses the hardware Local Data Store (LDS) which is; automatically allocated when the hardware creates work-groups of wavefronts, and; freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instruction",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst:154358,access,access,154358,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Changes made by different passes may make MemorySSA either ""overly; optimized"" (it can provide a more accurate result than if it were recomputed; from scratch), or ""under optimized"" (it could infer more if it were recomputed).; This can lead to challenges to reproduced results in isolation with a single pass; when the result relies on the state acquired by ``MemorySSA`` due to being updated by; multiple subsequent passes.; Passes that use and update ``MemorySSA`` should do so through the APIs provided by the; ``MemorySSAUpdater``, or through calls on the Walker.; Direct optimizations to ``MemorySSA`` are not permitted.; There is currently a single, narrowly scoped exception where DSE (DeadStoreElimination); updates an optimized access of a store, after a traversal that guarantees the; optimization is correct. This is solely allowed due to the traversals and inferences; being beyond what ``MemorySSA`` does and them being ""free"" (i.e. DSE does them anyway).; This exception is set under a flag (""-dse-optimize-memoryssa"") and can be disabled to; help reproduce optimizations in isolation.

Explicitly defined registers are normal operands, and can be accessed; with ``MachineInstr::getOperand(int)::getReg()``. In order to check which; registers are implicitly defined by an instruction, use the; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitDefs``, where ``opcode`` is the opcode; of the target instruction. One important difference between explicit and; implicit physical registers is that the latter are defined statically for each; instruction, whereas the former may vary depending on the program being; compiled. For example, an instruction that represents a function call will; always implicitly define or use the same set of physical registers. To read the; registers implicitly used by an instruction, use; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitUses``. Pre-colored registers impose; constraints on any register allocation algorithm. The register allocator must; make sure that none of them are overwritten by the values of virtual registers; while still alive.

Security," inclusion of a header file macro-defining bounds annotations to; empty).; * It has a relatively low adoption cost. This document discusses the key designs of ``-fbounds-safety``. The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true. In the example below, pointer ``p``; annotated with ``__counted_by(count)`` must always point to a memory buffer; containing at least ``count`` elements of the pointee type. Changing the value; of ``count``, like in the example below, may violate this invariant and permit; out-of-bounds access to the pointer. To avoid this, the compiler employs; compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as necessary to ensure the; new count v",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:3562,access,access,3562,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Functionally analogous to ``SmallSet<StringRef>``, ``StringSet`` also supports; iteration. (The iterator dereferences to a ``StringMapEntry<char>``, so you; need to call ``i->getKey()`` to access the item of the StringSet.)

See also [Category reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooCategory.html). ### Type-safe proxies for RooFit objects; RooFit's proxy classes have been modernised. The class `RooTemplateProxy` allows for access to other RooFit objects; similarly to a smart pointer. In older versions of RooFit, the objects held by *e.g.* `RooRealProxy` had to be; accessed like this:; RooAbsArg* absArg = realProxy.absArg();; RooAbsPdf* pdf = dynamic_cast<RooAbsPdf*>(absArg);; assert(pdf); // This *should* work, but the proxy doesn't have a way to check; pdf->fitTo(...);; That is, a `RooRealProxy` stores a pointer to a RooAbsArg, and this pointer has to be cast. There was no type; safety, *i.e.*, any object deriving from RooAbsArg could be stored in that proxy, and the user had to take care; of ensuring that types are correct.; Now, if one uses; RooTemplateProxy<RooAbsPdf> pdfProxy;; instead of; RooRealProxy realProxy;; in RooFit classes, the above code can be simplified to; pdfProxy->fitTo(...);.

Each scalar type has a parent type, which must also; be a scalar type or the TBAA root. Via this parent relation, scalar types; within a TBAA root form a tree. **Struct type descriptors** denote types; that contain a sequence of other type descriptors, at known offsets. These; contained type descriptors can either be struct type descriptors themselves; or scalar type descriptors. **Access tags** are metadata nodes attached to load and store instructions.; Access tags use type descriptors to describe the *location* being accessed; in terms of the type system of the higher level language. Access tags are; tuples consisting of a base type, an access type and an offset. The base; type is a scalar type descriptor or a struct type descriptor, the access; type is a scalar type descriptor, and the offset is a constant integer.

Security," is inconvenient and wasteful for every front-end to; have to reproduce this logic. Memory in LLVM; ==============. The 'trick' here is that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space. Stack variables; work the same way, except that instead of being declared with global; variable definitions, they are declared with the `LLVM alloca; instruction <../../LangRef.html#alloca-instruction>`_:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @example() {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; ...; %tmp = load i32, i32* %X ; load the stack value %X from the stack.; %tmp2 = add i32 %tmp, 1 ; increment it; store i32 %tmp2, i32* %X ; store it back; ...

The following process occurs on the discussion medium for each reported issue:. * A security issue reporter (not necessarily an LLVM contributor) reports an issue.; * Within two business days, a member of the Security Group is put in charge of driving the issue to an acceptable resolution. This champion doesn’t need to be the same person for each issue. This person can self-nominate.; * Members of the Security Group discuss in which circumstances (if any) an issue is relevant to security, and determine if it is a security issue.; * Negotiate an embargo date for public disclosure, with a default minimum time limit of ninety days.; * Security Group members can recommend that key experts be pulled in to specific issue discussions. The key expert can be pulled in unless there are objections from other Security Group members.; * Patches are written and reviewed.; * Backporting security patches from recent versions to old versions cannot always work. It is up to the Security Group to decide if such backporting should be done, and how far back.; * The Security Group figures out how the LLVM project’s own releas",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst:12130,secur,security,12130,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,1,['secur'],['security']
Security," is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``\ s has quadratic time complexity and is not done; by default. A walk of the uses for any MemoryDef can find the accesses that were optimized; to it.; A code snippet for such a walk looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++.

Security," isn't given the llvm.loop prefix; as it is not affected by the ``llvm.loop.disable_nonforced`` metadata. '``llvm.access.group``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``llvm.access.group`` metadata can be attached to any instruction that; potentially accesses memory. It can point to a single distinct metadata; node, which we call access group. This node represents all memory access; instructions referring to it via ``llvm.access.group``. When an; instruction belongs to multiple access groups, it can also point to a; list of accesses groups, illustrated by the following example. .. code-block:: llvm. %val = load i32, ptr %arrayidx, !llvm.access.group !0; ...; !0 = !{!1, !2}; !1 = distinct !{}; !2 = distinct !{}. It is illegal for the list node to be empty since it might be confused; with an access group. The access group metadata node must be 'distinct' to avoid collapsing; multiple access groups by content. An access group metadata node must; always be empty which can be used to distinguish an access group; metadata node from a list of access groups. Being empty avoids the; situation that the content must be updated which, because metadata is; immutable by design, would required finding and updating all references; to the access group node. The access group can be used to refer to a memory access instruction; without pointing to it directly (which is not possible in global; metadata). Currently, the only metadata making use of it is; ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``. '``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata refers to one or more; access group metadata nodes (see ``llvm.access.group``). It denotes that; no loop-carried memory dependence exist between it and other instructions; in the loop with this metadata.

Boolean vectors are a Clang extension of the ext vector type. Boolean vectors; are intended, though not guaranteed, to map to vector mask registers. The size; parameter of a boolean vector type is the number of bits in the vector. The; boolean vector is dense and each bit in the boolean vector is one vector; element. The semantics of boolean vectors borrows from C bit-fields with the following; differences:. * Distinct boolean vectors are always distinct memory objects (there is no; packing).; * Only the operators `?:`, `!`, `~`, `|`, `&`, `^` and comparison are allowed on; boolean vectors.; * Casting a scalar bool value to a boolean vector type means broadcasting the; scalar value onto all lanes (same as general ext_vector_type).; * It is not possible to access or swizzle elements of a boolean vector; (different than general ext_vector_type).

However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape.

These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important. However, if community input is not reached before the; release is out, all bugs reported will have to go on the next stable release. The official release managers are:. * Even releases: Tom Stellard (tstellar@redhat.com); * Odd releases: Tobias Hieta (tobias@hieta.se). The official release testers are volunteered from the community and have; consistently validated and released binaries for their targets/OSs.

The index expressions shall have integral or unscoped; enumeration type and shall not be uses of the comma operator unless; parenthesized. The first index expression shall evaluate to a; non-negative value less than ``R``, and the second index expression shall; evaluate to a non-negative value less than ``C``, or else the expression has; undefined behavior. If ``E1`` is a prvalue, the result is a prvalue with type; ``T`` and is the value of the element at the given row and column in the matrix.; Otherwise, the result is a glvalue with type ``cv T`` and with the same value; category as ``E1`` which refers to the element at the given row and column in; the matrix. Programs containing a single subscript expression into a matrix are ill-formed. **Note**: We considered providing an expression of the form; ``postfix-expression [expression]`` to access columns of a matrix. We think; that such an expression would be problematic once both column and row major; matrixes are supported: depending on the memory layout, either accessing columns; or rows can be done efficiently, but not both. Instead, we propose to provide; builtins to extract rows and columns from a matrix. This makes the operations; more explicit. Matrix Type Binary Operators; ----------------------------.

DWARF lane identifies specify a target architecture lane position for hardware; that executes in a SIMD or SIMT manner, and on which a source language maps its; threads of execution onto those lanes. The DWARF lane identifier is pushed by; the ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` DWARF expression operation. See DWARF Version 5; section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*; section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a; wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1. Operation Expressions; ---------------------. DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of; program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory; and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least; significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least; significant bits first. For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe; unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:; the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single; location description is the spilled memory location description. The; ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the; memory location description.

Security," memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires; hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load. GitHub has one important advantage over GitLab and; BitBucket: it offers read-write **SVN** access to the repository; (https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).; This would enable people to continue working post-migration as though our code; were still canonically in an SVN repository. In addition, there are already multiple LLVM mirrors on GitHub, indicating that; part of our community has already settled there. On Managing Revision Numbers with Git; -------------------------------------. The current SVN repository hosts all the LLVM sub-projects alongside each other.; A single revision number (e.g. r123456) thus identifies a consistent version of; all LLVM sub-projects. Git does not use sequential integer revision number but instead uses a hash to; identify each commit. The loss of a sequential integer revision number has been a sticking point in; past discussions about Git:. - ""The 'branch' I most care about is mainline, and losing the ability to say; 'fixed in r1234' (with some sort of monotonically increasing number) would; be a tragic",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst:3568,access,access,3568,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,1,['access'],['access']

By default, objects involved in RNTuple I/O (objects read from disk or written to disk) are passed to RNTuple as shared pointers.; Both RNTuple or the application may create the object.; Raw pointers to objects can be passed to RNTuple -- such objects are considered as owned by the application.; The caller has to ensure that the lifetime of the object lasts during the I/O operations. An RNTuple writer that is constructed without a `TFile` object (`RNTupleWriter::Recreate()`) assumes exclusive access to the underlying file.; An RNTuple writer that uses a `TFile` for writing (`RNTupleWriter::Append()`) assumes that the `TFile` object outlives the writer's lifetime.; The serial writer assumes exclusive access to the underlying file during construction, destruction and `Fill()` as well as `CommitCluster()` and `FlushCluster()`.; For `FlushColumns()` and `FillNoFlush()`, the sequential writer assumes exclusive access only if buffered writing is turned off.; The parallel writer assumes exclusive access to the underlying file during all operations on the writer (e.g. construction and destruction) and all operations on any created fill context (e.g. `Fill()` and `FlushCluster()`).; Notable exceptions are `FlushColumns()` and `FillNoFlush()` which are guaranteed to never access the underlying `TFile` during parallel writing (which is always buffered).

The AliasSetTracker class is implemented to be as efficient as possible. It; uses the union-find algorithm to efficiently merge AliasSets when a pointer is; inserted into the AliasSetTracker that aliases multiple sets. The primary data; structure is a hash table mapping pointers to the AliasSet they are in. The AliasSetTracker class must maintain a list of all of the LLVM ``Value*``\s; that are in each AliasSet. Since the hash table already has entries for each; LLVM ``Value*`` of interest, the AliasesSets thread the linked list through; these hash-table nodes to avoid having to allocate memory unnecessarily, and to; make merging alias sets extremely efficient (the linked list merge is constant; time). You shouldn't need to understand these details if you are just a client of the; AliasSetTracker, but if you look at the code, hopefully this brief description; will help make sense of why things are designed the way they are. Using the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface directly; ----------------------------------------------. If neither of these utility class are what your pass needs, you should use the; interfaces exposed by the ``AliasAnalysis`` class directly. Try to use the; higher-level methods when possible (e.g., use mod/ref information instead of the; `alias`_ method directly if possible) to get the best precision and efficiency.

For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:. The ``Type`` class and its subclasses; -------------------------------------. The ``Type`` class (and its subclasses) are an important part of the AST.; Types are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates; and uniques them as they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines.

Security," not all of it is; considered security-sensitive. This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC. In some cases, parts of the codebase could be handled; as security-sensitive but need significant work to get to the stage where that's; manageable. The LLVM community will need to decide whether it wants to invest in; making these parts of the code securable, and maintain these security; properties over time. In all cases the LLVM Security Group should be consulted,; since they'll be responding to security issues filed against these parts of the; codebase. If you're not sure whether an issue is in-scope for this security process or; not, err towards assuming that it is. The Security Group might agree or disagree; and will explain its rationale in the report, as well as update this document; through the above process. The security-sensitive parts of the LLVM Project currently are the following.; Note that this list can change over time. * None are currently defined.

Security," object; becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object,; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no; longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other; object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Although we chose to call our pointer `my_objptr`, to emphasize that; it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```. As we have seen, heap objects; have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be; accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; ```. Here we have a `Quad` pointer that has been initialized with the; address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of; stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically,; which could leave you with an illegal pointer. Using it will corrupt; and may as well crash the program!. It is time to look at the destruction of objects. A destructor is a; special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an; object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the; object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a; destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to; our Quad class so that we can see when it is called. The class names; the destructor but with a prefix \~ which is the C++ one's complement; i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtone",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/ALittleC++.md:11668,access,accessed,11668,documentation/users-guide/ALittleC++.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/ALittleC++.md,1,['access'],['accessed']
Security," of **`TObject`** derived classes can be stored; in ROOT containers. However, the **`TObject`** class provides some; member functions that allow you to tune the behavior of objects in; containers. For example, by default two objects are considered equal if; their pointers point to the same address. This might be too strict for; some classes where equality is already achieved if some or all of the; data members are equal. By overriding the following **`TObject`** member; functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. - `IsEqual()`is used by the `FindObject() `collection method. By; default, `IsEqual()` compares the two object pointers. - `Compare()`returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller,; equal or larger than the other object. By default, a **`TObject`**; has not a valid `Compare()` method. - `IsSortable() `returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it; has a valid `Compare(`) method). By default, a **`TObject`** is not; sort able. - `Hash() `returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an; object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique,; like **`THashTable`**, **`THashList`** and **`TMap`**. By default,; `Hash(`) returns the address of the object. It is essential to; choose a good hash function. The example below shows how to use and override these member functions. ``` {.cpp}; class TObjNum : public TObject {; private:; Int_t num; // TObjNum is a simple container for an integer.; public:; TObjNum(Int_t i = 0) : num(i) { }; ~TObjNum() { }; void SetNum(Int_t i) { num = i; }; Int_t GetNum() const { return num; }; void Print(Option_t *) const; { printf(""num = %dn"", num); }; Bool_t IsEqual(TObject *obj) const; { return num == ((TObjNum*)obj)->num; }; Bool_t IsSortable() const { return kTRUE; }; Int_t Compare(const TObject *obj) const; { if (num < ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return -1;; else if (num > ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return 1;; else return 0; }; ULong_t Hash() const { return num; }; };; ```. ## The TIter Ge",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:9337,hash,hash,9337,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['hash'],['hash']

This configuration is called the floating point environment.; C and C++ restrict access to the floating point environment by default, and the; compiler is allowed to assume that all operations are performed in the default; environment. When code is compiled in this default mode, operations that depend; on the environment (such as floating-point arithmetic and `FLT_ROUNDS`) may have; undefined behavior if the dynamic environment is not the default environment; for; example, `FLT_ROUNDS` may or may not simply return its default value for the target; instead of reading the dynamic environment, and floating-point operations may be; optimized as if the dynamic environment were the default. Similarly, it is undefined; behavior to change the floating point environment in this default mode, for example; by calling the `fesetround` function.; C provides two pragmas to allow code to dynamically modify the floating point environment:. - ``#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON`` allows dynamic changes to the entire floating; point environment. - ``#pragma STDC FENV_ROUND FE_DYNAMIC`` allows dynamic changes to just the floating; point rounding mode.

The design; of the method pool is similar to that of the :ref:`identifier table; <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the first time a particular selector is formed; during the compilation of the program, Clang will search in the on-disk hash; table of selectors; if found, Clang will read the Objective-C methods; associated with that selector into the appropriate front-end data structure; (``Sema::InstanceMethodPool`` and ``Sema::FactoryMethodPool`` for instance and; class methods, respectively). As with identifiers, selectors are represented by numeric values within the AST; file. A separate index maps these numeric selector values to the offset of the; selector within the on-disk hash table, and will be used when de-serializing an; Objective-C method declaration (or other Objective-C construct) that refers to; the selector. AST Reader Integration Points; -----------------------------. The ""lazy"" deserialization behavior of AST files requires their integration; into several completely different submodules of Clang. For example, lazily; deserializing the declarations during name lookup requires that the name-lookup; routines be able to query the AST file to find entities stored there. For each Clang data structure that requires direct interaction with the AST; reader logic, there is an abstract class that provides the interface between; the two modules.

It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations.

Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabyt",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:28124,attack,attacker,28124,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['attack'],['attacker']

Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you.

'``llvm.access.group``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``llvm.access.group`` metadata can be attached to any instruction that; potentially accesses memory. It can point to a single distinct metadata; node, which we call access group. This node represents all memory access; instructions referring to it via ``llvm.access.group``. When an; instruction belongs to multiple access groups, it can also point to a; list of accesses groups, illustrated by the following example. .. code-block:: llvm. %val = load i32, ptr %arrayidx, !llvm.access.group !0; ...; !0 = !{!1, !2}; !1 = distinct !{}; !2 = distinct !{}. It is illegal for the list node to be empty since it might be confused; with an access group. The access group metadata node must be 'distinct' to avoid collapsing; multiple access groups by content. An access group metadata node must; always be empty which can be used to distinguish an access group; metadata node from a list of access groups. Being empty avoids the; situation that the content must be updated which, because metadata is; immutable by design, would required finding and updating all references; to the access group node. The access group can be used to refer to a memory access instruction; without pointing to it directly (which is not possible in global; metadata).

The primary use case of; MemTagSanitizer is code hardening in production binaries, where it is; expected to be a strong mitigation for both stack and heap-based; memory bugs. Usage; =====. Compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=memtag`` flag. This; will only work when targeting AArch64 with MemTag extension. One; possible way to achieve that is to add ``-target; aarch64-linux -march=armv8+memtag`` to compilation flags. Implementation; ==============. See `HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizer`_ for a general overview of a; tag-based approach to memory safety. MemTagSanitizer follows a; similar implementation strategy, but with the tag storage (shadow); provided by the hardware. A quick overview of MTE hardware capabilities:. * Every 16 aligned bytes of memory can be assigned a 4-bit Allocation Tag.; * Every pointer can have a 4-bit Address Tag that is in its most significant byte.; * Most memory access instructions generate an exception if Address Tag != Allocation Tag.; * Special instructions are provided for fast tag manipulation. Stack instrumentation; =====================. Stack-based memory errors are detected by updating Allocation Tag for; each local variable to a random value at the start of its lifetime,; and resetting it to the stack pointer Address Tag at the end of; it. Unallocated stack space is expected to match the Address Tag of; SP; this allows to skip tagging of any variable when memory safety can; be statically proven. Allocating a truly random tag for each stack variable in a large; function may incur significant code size overhead, because it means; that each variable's address is an independent, non-rematerializable; value; thus a function with N local variables will have extra N live; values to keep through most of its life time. For this reason MemTagSanitizer generates at most one random tag per; function, called a ""base tag"".

Security," start with; `RQ_OBJECT(""ClassName"") `macro. This macro allows the signals/slots; communication mechanism to be applied between compiled and interpreted; classes in an interactive ROOT session without having the class derive; from **`TQObject`**. Every signal method declaration is followed by a; comment `""*SIGNAL*"".` Only instances of a class that defines a signal or; instances of its subclasses can emit the signal. The ROOT implementation; of a popular example presenting signals and slots is the next. Let's; have a minimal class declaration:. ``` {.cpp}; class MyClass {; private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; MyClass() { fValue=0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t);; };; ```. It will become the following as interpreted:. ``` {.cpp}; class MyClass {; RQ_OBJECT(""MyClass""); private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; MyClass() { fValue=0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t); // *SIGNAL*; };; ```. Both class declarations have the same data member and public methods to; access the value. By placing the `RQ_OBJECT(""MyClass"")` macro inside the; `MyClass` body (`MyClass` is not inherited from **`TQObject`**) we allow; this class to use the signal/slot communication.

The line `Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"",v)` activates the signal; `SetValue(Int_t)` with argument v. You can use any of the methods; **`TQObject::Emit(""full_method_name"",arguments)`** to emit a signal. We; create two instances of `MyClass` and connect them together:. ``` {.cpp}; MyClass *objA = new MyClass();; MyClass *objB = new MyClass();; objA->Connect(""SetValue(Int_t)"",""MyClass"",objB,""SetValue(Int_t)"");; objB->SetValue(11);; objA->SetValue(79);; objB->",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md:44067,access,access,44067,documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,1,['access'],['access']

The ``__builtin_prefetch(addr, rw, locality)`` builtin is expected to be used to; avoid cache misses when the developer has a good understanding of which data; are going to be used next. ``addr`` is the address that needs to be brought into; the cache. ``rw`` indicates the expected access mode: ``0`` for *read* and ``1``; for *write*. In case of *read write* access, ``1`` is to be used. ``locality``; indicates the expected persistence of data in cache, from ``0`` which means that; data can be discarded from cache after its next use to ``3`` which means that; data is going to be reused a lot once in cache. ``1`` and ``2`` provide; intermediate behavior between these two extremes.

This scenario can arise, for example, if you want to collapse a; substructure into its parent. .. code-block:: c++. llvm::StringRef e = ""expr"", m = ""member"";; auto child_call = cxxMemberCallExpr(on(expr().bind(e)),; 				 callee(cxxMethodDecl(hasName(""child""))));; makeRule(cxxMemberCallExpr(on(child_call), callee(memberExpr().bind(m)),; 	 changeTo(cat(e, ""."", member(m), ""()""))),; 	 cat(""``child`` accessor is being removed; call "",; 		member(m), "" directly on parent""));. This rule isn't quite what we want: it will rewrite ``my_object.child().foo()`` to; ``my_object.foo()``, but it will also rewrite ``my_ptr->child().foo()`` to; ``my_ptr.foo()``, which is not what we intend. We could fix this by restricting; the pattern with ``not(isArrow())`` in the definition of ``child_call``. Yet, we; *want* to rewrite calls through pointers. To capture this idiom, we provide the ``access`` combinator to intelligently; construct a field/method access. In our example, the member access is expressed; as:. .. code-block:: c++. access(e, cat(member(m))). The first argument specifies the object being accessed and the second, a; description of the field/method name. In this case, we specify that the method; name should be copied from the source -- specifically, the source range of ``m``'s; member. To construct the method call, we would use this expression in ``cat``:. .. code-block:: c++. cat(access(e, cat(member(m))), ""()"").

All of; these accesses then tell us that we didn't have a match. Name Hash Tables; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". To solve the issues mentioned above we have structured the hash tables a bit; differently: a header, buckets, an array of all unique 32 bit hash values,; followed by an array of hash value data offsets, one for each hash value, then; the data for all hash values:. .. code-block:: none. .-------------.; | HEADER |; |-------------|; | BUCKETS |; |-------------|; | HASHES |; |-------------|; | OFFSETS |; |-------------|; | DATA |; `-------------'. The ``BUCKETS`` in the name tables are an index into the ``HASHES`` array.

Most often checking the 32 bit hash values is as far as the lookup; goes. If it does match, it usually is a match with no collisions.

This section presents the visualization technique available in ROOT; to represent multiple variables (>4) data sets. #### Spider (Radar) Plots. Spider plots (sometimes called “web-plots” or “radar plots”) are used; to compare series of data points (events). They use the human ability; to spot un-symmetry. ![Example of spider plot.](pictures/spider1.png). Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle.; For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and; the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for; an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult; to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view; of an event in order to compare it with the others. In ROOT the spider; plot facility is accessed from the tree viewer GUI. The variables to; be visualized are selected in the tree viewer and can be scanned using; the spider plot button. ![The tree viewer Graphical User Interface and the Spider Plot Editor.](pictures/spider2.png). The spider plot graphics editor provides two tabs to interact with; the spider plots’ output: the tab “Style” defining the spider layout; and the tab “Browse” to navigate in the tree. #### Parallel Coordinates Plots; \index{parallel coordinates}. The Parallel Coordinates Plots are a common way of studying and; visualizing multiple variables data sets. They were proposed by in; A.Inselberg in 1981 as a new way to represent multi-dimensional; information. In traditional Cartesian coordinates, axes are mutually; perpendicular. In Parallel coordinates, all axes are parallel which; allows representing data in much more than three dimensions.

A; method that performs this task finding the next location is; TGeoManager::Step(), described in ""Making a Step"", but users may; implement more precise methods to insure post-step boundary crossing. \anchor GP08; ## Geometry Graphical User Interface. The geombuilder package allows you to create and edit geometries. The; package provides a library of all GUI classes related to geometry. Each; editable geometry class `TGeoXXX` have a correspondent editor; `TGeoXXXEditor` that provides a graphics user interface allowing to; edit some (or all) parameters of a geometry object. The editable objects; are geometry manager, volumes, nodes, shapes, media, materials and; matrices. The interfaces provide also access to specific functionality; of geometry objects. The editing mechanism is based on ROOT GED; (Graphics Editors) functionality and the library is loaded using the; plug-in mechanism. \anchor GP08a; ### Editing a Geometry. There are two different use cases having different ways of invoking the; geometry editors. The first one applies when starting with geometry from; scratch and using the builder functionality to create new geometry; objects. In this case, one should use the sequence:. ~~~{.cpp}; root[] TGeoManager *geom = new TGeoManager(""MyGeom"",; ""Test builder"");; root[] geom->Edit(Option_t *option="""");; ~~~.

Security," the non-ARC rule which states that such; properties are implicitly ``assign``. However, that rule is clearly; untenable in ARC, since it leads to default-unsafe code. The main merit to; banning the properties is to avoid confusion with non-ARC practice, which did; not ultimately strike us as sufficient to justify requiring extra syntax and; (more importantly) forcing novices to understand ownership rules just to; declare a property when the default is so reasonable. Changing the rule away; from non-ARC practice was acceptable because we had conservatively banned the; synthesis in order to give ourselves exactly this leeway. Applying ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` to a property not of retainable object; pointer type has the same behavior it does outside of ARC: it requires the; property type to be some sort of pointer and permits the use of modifiers other; than ``assign``. These modifiers only affect the synthesized getter and; setter; direct accesses to the ivar (even if synthesized) still have primitive; semantics, and the value in the ivar will not be automatically released during; deallocation. .. _arc.ownership.semantics:. Semantics; ---------. There are five :arc-term:`managed operations` which may be performed on an; object of retainable object pointer type. Each qualifier specifies different; semantics for each of these operations. It is still undefined behavior to; access an object outside of its lifetime. A load or store with ""primitive semantics"" has the same semantics as the; respective operation would have on an ``void*`` lvalue with the same alignment; and non-ownership qualification. :arc-term:`Reading` occurs when performing a lvalue-to-rvalue conversion on an; object lvalue. * For ``__weak`` objects, the current pointee is retained and then released at; the end of the current full-expression.

Typically filter expressions are used to determine; if the exception came from a particular DLL or code region, or if code faulted; while accessing a particular memory address range. LLVM does not currently have; IR to represent filter expressions because it is difficult to represent their; control dependencies. Filter expressions run during the first phase of EH,; before cleanups run, making it very difficult to build a faithful control flow; graph. For now, the new EH instructions cannot represent SEH filter; expressions, and frontends must outline them ahead of time. Local variables of; the parent function can be escaped and accessed using the ``llvm.localescape``; and ``llvm.localrecover`` intrinsics. New exception handling instructions; ------------------------------------. The primary design goal of the new EH instructions is to support funclet; generation while preserving information about the CFG so that SSA formation; still works. As a secondary goal, they are designed to be generic across MSVC; and Itanium C++ exceptions. They make very few assumptions about the data; required by the personality, so long as it uses the familiar core EH actions:; catch, cleanup, and terminate. However, the new instructions are hard to modify; without knowing details of the EH personality. While they can be used to; represent Itanium EH, the landingpad model is strictly better for optimization; purposes. The following new instructions are considered ""exception handling pads"", in that; they must be the first non-phi instruction of a basic block that may be the; unwind destination of an EH flow edge:; `",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:24796,access,accessed,24796,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['access'],['accessed']

Introduction; ============. This is a proposal to move our current revision control system from our own; hosted Subversion to GitHub. Below are the financial and technical arguments as; to why we are proposing such a move and how people (and validation; infrastructure) will continue to work with a Git-based LLVM. What This Proposal is *Not* About; =================================. Changing the development policy. This proposal relates only to moving the hosting of our source-code repository; from SVN hosted on our own servers to Git hosted on GitHub. We are not proposing; using GitHub's issue tracker, pull-requests, or code-review. Contributors will continue to earn commit access on demand under the Developer; Policy, except that that a GitHub account will be required instead of SVN; username/password-hash. Why Git, and Why GitHub?; ========================. Why Move At All?; ----------------. This discussion began because we currently host our own Subversion server; and Git mirror on a voluntary basis. The LLVM Foundation sponsors the server and; provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do. Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------.

Discussion Medium; =================. *FUTURE*: this section needs more work! Where discussions occur is influenced by other factors that are still open in this document. We can finalize it later.; It seems like bugzilla and email don't meet security requirements. The medium used to host LLVM Security Group discussions is security-sensitive. It should therefore run on infrastructure which can meet our security expectations. We are currently using the `chromium issue tracker`_ (as the `llvm` project) to have security discussions:. * File security issues.; * Discuss security improvements to LLVM. When a new issue is filed, a template is provided to help issue reporters provide all relevant information. *FUTURE*: The `Github security`_ workflow allows publicly disclosing resolved security issues on the github project page, and we would be interested in adopting it for that purpose. However, it does not easily allow confidential reporting of security issues, as creating Github Security Advisories is currently restricted to Github project admins. That is why we have started with the `chromium issue tracker`_ instead. We also occasionally need to discuss logistics of the LLVM Security Group itself:. * Nominate new members.; * Propose member removal.; * Suggest policy changes. We often have these discussions publicly, in our :ref:`monthly public sync-up call <online-sync-ups>` and on the Discourse forums. For internal or confidential discussions, we also use a private mailing list. Process; =======. The following process occurs on the discussion medium for each reported issue:. * A security issue reporter (not necessarily an LLVM contributor) reports an issue.; * Within two business days, a member of the Security Group is put in charge of driving the issue to an acceptable res",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst:11260,secur,security,11260,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,2,['secur'],['security']

Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different. Architects and many compiler people care much more about; > the second question. The Java compiler and OS community care much more; > about the first one. 3.

Pointer parameter without corresponding ``Param`` is considered unsafe and we; assume that access with any offset is possible. Example:. If we have the following function:. .. code-block:: text. define i64 @foo(ptr %0, ptr %1, ptr %2, i8 %3) {; store ptr %1, ptr @x; %5 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i64 5; %6 = load i8, ptr %5; %7 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i8 %3; tail call void @bar(i8 %3, ptr %7); %8 = load i64, ptr %0; ret i64 %8; }. We can expect the record like this:. .. code-block:: text. params: ((param: 0, offset: [0, 7]),(param: 2, offset: [5, 5], calls: ((callee: ^3, param: 1, offset: [-128, 127])))). The function may access just 8 bytes of the parameter %0 . ``calls`` is empty,; so the parameter is either not used for function calls or ``offset`` already; covers all accesses from nested function calls.; Parameter %1 escapes, so access is unknown.; The function itself can access just a single byte of the parameter %2. Additional; access is possible inside of the ``@bar`` or ``^3``. The function adds signed; offset to the pointer and passes the result as the argument %1 into ``^3``.; This record itself does not tell us how ``^3`` will access the parameter.; Parameter %3 is not a pointer. .. _refs_summary:.

With the `CalcPi` example, you should be able to see; two threads calculating Pi with the given number of intervals as; precision. ### TThread in More Details. Cling is not thread safe yet, and it will block the execution of the; threads until it has finished executing. #### Asynchronous Actions. Different threads can work simultaneously with the same object. Some; actions can be dangerous. For example, when two threads create a; histogram object, ROOT allocates memory and puts them to the same; collection. If it happens at the same time, the results are; undetermined. To avoid this problem, the user has to synchronize these; actions with:. ``` {.cpp}; TThread::Lock() // Locking the following part of code; ... // Create an object, etc...; TThread::UnLock() // Unlocking; ```. The code between `Lock()` and `UnLock()` will be performed; uninterrupted. No other threads can perform actions or access; objects/collections while it is being executed. The methods; `TThread::Lock() `and **`TThread::UnLock()`** internally use a global; `TMutex` instance for locking. The user may also define their own **`TMutex`** `MyMutex` instance and may; locally protect their asynchronous actions by calling `MyMutex.Lock()` and; `MyMutex.UnLock().`. #### Synchronous Actions: TCondition. To synchronize the actions of different threads you can use the; **`TCondition`** class, which provides a signaling mechanism. The; **`TCondition`** instance must be accessible by all threads that need to; use it, i.e. it should be a global object (or a member of the class; which owns the threaded methods, see below). To create a; **`TCondition`** object, a **`TMutex`** instance is required for the; Wait and `TimedWait` locking methods. One can pass the address of an; external mutex to the **`TCondition`** constructor:. ``` {.cpp}; TMutex MyMutex;; TCondition MyCondition(&MyMutex);; ```.

With N starting from 1, the 2N - 1 th operand,; an ``MDNode``, denotes a contained field, and the 2N th operand, a; ``ConstantInt``, is the offset of the said contained field. The offsets; must be in non-decreasing order. Access tags are represented as ``MDNode`` s with either 3 or 4 operands.; The first operand is an ``MDNode`` pointing to the node representing the; base type. The second operand is an ``MDNode`` pointing to the node; representing the access type. The third operand is a ``ConstantInt`` that; states the offset of the access. If a fourth field is present, it must be; a ``ConstantInt`` valued at 0 or 1. If it is 1 then the access tag states; that the location being accessed is ""constant"" (meaning; ``pointsToConstantMemory`` should return true; see `other useful; AliasAnalysis methods <AliasAnalysis.html#OtherItfs>`_). The TBAA root of; the access type and the base type of an access tag must be the same, and; that is the TBAA root of the access tag. '``tbaa.struct``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>` is often used to implement; aggregate assignment operations in C and similar languages, however it; is defined to copy a contiguous region of memory, which is more than; strictly necessary for aggregate types which contain holes due to; padding. Also, it doesn't contain any TBAA information about the fields; of the aggregate. ``!tbaa.struct`` metadata can describe which memory subregions in a; memcpy are padding and what the TBAA tags of the struct are. The current metadata format is very simple. ``!tbaa.struct`` metadata; nodes are a list of operands which are in conceptual groups of three.; For each group of three, the first operand gives the byte offset of a; field in bytes, the second gives its size in bytes, and the third gives; its tbaa tag. e.g.:. .. code-block:: llvm. !4 = !{ i64 0, i64 4, !1, i64 8, i64 4, !2 }.

An example of configuration file for **lighttpd** server is:. ```; server.modules += ( ""mod_fastcgi"" ); fastcgi.server = (; ""/root.app"" =>; (( ""host"" => ""192.168.1.11"",; ""port"" => 9000,; ""check-local"" => ""disable"",; ""docroot"" => ""/""; )); ); ```. Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`.

For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`.

Menus provide a list of commands or options helping the user to select; and to perform a task. The menu system classes are **`TGMenuBar`**,; **`TGMenuTitle`**, **`TGPopupMenu`**, and **`TGMenuEntry`**. The **`TGMenuBar`** class implements a menu bar widget. It is used to; specify and provide access to common and frequently used application; actions described in menu titles, implemented by **`TGMenuTitle`**; class. The menu bar is the highest-level of the menu system and it is a; starting point for all interactions. Also, it is always visible and; allows using the keyboard equivalents. The geometry of the menu bar is; automatically set to the parent widget, i.e. the menu bar automatically; resizes itself so that it has the same width as its parent (typically; **`TGMainFrame`**). The menu bar is as a container for its menus - objects of the type; **`TGPopupMenu.`** Popup menus can appear in a menu bar. They can be a; sub-menu of another popup menu (cascading menus) or can be standalone; (as a context menu). They are made of one or more menu items choices.; When displayed, the menu items are arranged in a vertical list. Usually; they correspond to actions (e.g. `Open`**)**.

Mitigating this requires hardening loads from these locations, or mitigating; the indirect call or indirect jump. Any of these are sufficient to block the; call or jump from using a speculatively stored value that has been read back. For both of these, using retpolines would be equally sufficient. One possible; hybrid approach is to use retpolines for indirect call and jump, while relying; on SLH to mitigate returns. Another approach that is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores.

There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1:",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:14410,attack,attack,14410,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['attack'],['attack']

Logarithmical search; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; We could introduce total ordering among the functions set, once ordered we; could then implement a logarithmical search. Lookup time still depends on N,; but adds a little of delay (*log(N)*). Present state; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; Both of the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (in theory) random-access approach.

Security," with the ``-Wthread-safety`` flag, e.g. .. code-block:: bash. clang -c -Wthread-safety example.cpp. Note that this example assumes the presence of a suitably annotated; :ref:`mutexheader` that declares which methods perform locking,; unlocking, and so on. Basic Concepts: Capabilities; ============================. Thread safety analysis provides a way of protecting *resources* with; *capabilities*. A resource is either a data member, or a function/method; that provides access to some underlying resource. The analysis ensures that; the calling thread cannot access the *resource* (i.e. call the function, or; read/write the data) unless it has the *capability* to do so. Capabilities are associated with named C++ objects which declare specific; methods to acquire and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.) These act like keys; or tokens that allow the thread to access a given resource. Just like physical; security keys, a thread cannot make copy of a capability, nor can it destroy; one. A thread can only release a capability to another thread, or acquire one; from another thread. The annotations are deliberately agnostic about the; exact mechanism used to acquir",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:4207,access,access,4207,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Mocks for; more complicated languages (e.g. C++) are much trickier: Any code involving; classes tends to have a lot of non-trivial surface area (e.g. vtables) that; would require great care to mock. Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance.

Let's look at an example where the raw pointer owns two different memory blocks:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership2() {; int *pi = new int; // pi is Defined; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; if (smth) {; pi = new int; // pi is Defined; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```. It can be refactored to use `unique_ptr` like this:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership2() {; auto pi = make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi);; if (smth) {; pi = make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi);; }; }; ```. In the following example, the raw pointer is used to access the heap object; after the ownership has been transferred. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership3() {; int *pi = new int; // pi is Defined; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; } else {; vector<unique_ptr<int>> v = {std::unique_ptr(pi)}; // pi is Compatible; print(*pi);; use(v);; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```. We can refactor this code to use `unique_ptr`, however we would have to; introduce a non-owning pointer variable, since we can't use the moved-from; `unique_ptr` to access the object:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership3() {; std::unique_ptr<int> pi = std::make_unique<int>();; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; } else {; int *pi_non_owning = pi.get();; vector<unique_ptr<int>> v = {std::move(pi)};; print(*pi_non_owning);; use(v);; }; }; ```. If the original code didn't call `delete` at the very end of the function, then; our refactoring may change the point at which we run the destructor and release; memory. Specifically, if there is some user code after `delete`, then extending; the lifetime of the object until the end of the function may hold locks for; longer than necessary, introduce memory overhead etc. One solution is to always replace `delete` with a call to `reset()`, and then; perform another analysis that removes unnecessary `reset()` calls. ```c++; void AddedMemoryOverhead() {; HugeObject *ho = new HugeObject();; use(ho);; delete ho; // Release the large amount of memory quickly.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:23851,access,access,23851,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"# Appendix A: Install and Build ROOT; \index{install ROOT}. ## License. ROOT is made available under the LGPL v2.1 license. For full details see; the file LICENSE in the ROOT distribution. ## Installing ROOT. To install ROOT you will need to go to the ROOT website at:; <https://root.cern/install/>. You have a choice to download the binaries or the source. The source is; quicker to transfer since it is only 31 MB, but you will need to compile; and link it. The binaries range from 50 MB to 100 MB depending on the; target platform. ## Choosing a Version. The ROOT developers follow the principle of ""release early and release; often"", however a very large portion of a user base requires a stable; product therefore generally three versions of the system is available; for download - new, old and pro:. - The *new* version evolves quickly, with weekly or bi-weekly; releases. Use this to get access to the latest and greatest, but it; may not be stable. By trying out the new version you can help us; converge quickly to a stable version that can then become the new; pro version. If you are a new user we would advice you to try the; new version. - The *pro* (production) version is a version we feel comfortable with; to exposing to a large audience for serious work. The change rate of; this version is much lower than for the new version, it is about 3; to 6 months. - The *old* version is the previous pro version that people might need; for some time before switching the new pro version. The old change; rate is the same as for pro. ## Installing Precompiled Binaries. The binaries are available for downloading from; <https://root.cern/install/>. Once downloaded; you need to unzip and de-tar the file. For example, if you have; downloaded ROOT v5.30 for Linux-SLC5:. ``` {.cpp}; % gunzip root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar.gz; % tar xvf root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar; ```.

Security,"# Collection Classes. Collections are a key feature of the ROOT system. Many, if not most, of; the applications you write will use collections. If you have used; parameterized C++ collections or polymorphic collections before, some of; this material will be review. However, much of this chapter covers; aspects of collections specific to the ROOT system. When you have read; this chapter, you will know. - How to create instances of collections. - The difference between lists, arrays, hash tables, maps, etc. - How to add and remove elements of a collection. - How to search a collection for a specific element. - How to access and modify collection elements. - How to iterate over a collection to access collection elements. - How to manage memory for collections and collection elements. - How collection elements are tested for equality (`IsEqual(`)). - How collection elements are compared (`Compare())` in case of sorted; collections. - How collection elements are hashed (`Hash()`) in hash tables. ## Understanding Collections. A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram; editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets; for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A; geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials; and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in; collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional; data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees. ### General Characteristics. The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to; `TObjects`, so:. - They can only hold objects that inherit from **`TObject`**. - They return pointers to `TObjects`, that have to be cast back to the; correct subclass. Collections are dynamic; they can grow in size as required.

Security,"# Example Analysis. This chapter is an example of a typical physics analysis. Large data; files are chained together and analyzed using the **`TSelector`** class. ## Explanation. This script uses four large data sets from the H1 collaboration at DESY; Hamburg. One can access these data sets (277 Mbytes) from the ROOT web; site at: <ftp://root.cern.ch/root/h1analysis/>. The physics plots generated by this example cannot be produced using; smaller data sets. There are several ways to analyze data stored in a ROOT Tree. - Using `TTree::Draw`:. - This is very convenient and efficient for small tasks. A; **`TTree`**::Draw call produces one histogram at the time. The; histogram is automatically generated. The selection expression may; be specified in the command line. - Using the **`TTreeViewer`**:. - This is a graphical interface to `TTree::Draw` with the same; functionality. - Using the code generated by `TTree::MakeClass`:. - In this case, the user creates an instance of the analysis class. They; have the control over the event loop and can generate an unlimited; number of histograms. - Using the code generated by `TTree::MakeSelector`: Like for the code; generated by **`TTree::MakeClass`**, the user can do complex analysis.; However, they cannot control the event loop. The event loop is; controlled by `TTree::Process` called by the user. This solution is; illustrated by the code below. The advantage of this method is that; it can be run in a parallel environment using PROOF (the Parallel; Root Facility). A chain of four files (originally converted from PAW ntuples) is used to; illustrate the various ways to loop on ROOT data sets. Each contains a; ROOT Tree named ""`h42`"".

Security,"# Folders and Tasks. ## Folders. ![](pictures/030000E1.png). A **`TFolder`** is a collection of objects; visible and expandable in the ROOT object browser. Folders have a name; and a title and are identified in the folder hierarchy by an ""UNIX-like""; naming convention. The base of all folders is `//root`. It is visible at; the top of the left panel in the browser. The browser shows several; folders under `//root`. New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder. ## Why Use Folders?. One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve; modularity. Each set of data has a producer class and one or many; consumer classes. When using folders, the producer class places a; pointer to the data into a folder, and the consumer class retrieves a; reference to the folder. The consumer can access the objects in a folder by specifying the path; name of the folder. Here is an example of a folder's path name:. `//root/Event/Hits/TCP`. One does not have to specify the full path name. If the partial path; name is unique, it will find it; otherwise it will return the first; occurrence of the path. The first diagram shows a system without folders. The objects have; pointers to each other to access each other's data. Pointers are an; efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer; creates a direct coupling between classes. This design can become a very; tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. ![](pictures/020000E2.jpg). In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the; consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data.; The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy; provides an alternative. It loosely couples the classes and greatly; enhances I/O operations. In this way, folders separate the data from the; algorithms and greatly improve the modularity of an application by; minimizing the class dependencies. ![](pictures/020000E3.jpg).

Security,"# Functions and Parameter Estimation #. After going through the previous chapters, you already know how to use; analytical functions (class `TF1`), and you got some insight into the; graph (`TGraphErrors`) and histogram classes (`TH1F`) for data; visualisation. In this chapter we will add more detail to the previous; approximate explanations to face the fundamental topic of parameter; estimation by fitting functions to data. For graphs and histograms, ROOT; offers an easy-to-use interface to perform fits - either the fit panel; of the graphical interface, or the `Fit` method. The class `TFitResult`; allows access to the detailed results. Very often it is necessary to study the statistical properties of; analysis procedures. This is most easily achieved by applying the; analysis to many sets of simulated data (or ""pseudo data""), each; representing one possible version of the true experiment. If the; simulation only deals with the final distributions observed in data, and; does not perform a full simulation of the underlying physics and the; experimental apparatus, the name ""Toy Monte Carlo"" is frequently used; [^5]. Since the true values of all parameters are known in the; pseudo-data, the differences between the parameter estimates from the; analysis procedure w.r.t. the true values can be determined, and it is; also possible to check that the analysis procedure provides correct; error estimates. ## Fitting Functions to Pseudo Data ##.

Security,"# Pointer Authentication. ## Introduction. Pointer Authentication is a mechanism by which certain pointers are signed.; When a pointer gets signed, a cryptographic hash of its value and other values; (pepper and salt) is stored in unused bits of that pointer. Before the pointer is used, it needs to be authenticated, i.e., have its; signature checked. This prevents pointer values of unknown origin from being; used to replace the signed pointer value. At the IR level, it is represented using:. * a [set of intrinsics](#intrinsics) (to sign/authenticate pointers); * a [call operand bundle](#operand-bundle) (to authenticate called pointers). The current implementation leverages the; [Armv8.3-A PAuth/Pointer Authentication Code](#armv8-3-a-pauth-pointer-authentication-code); instructions in the [AArch64 backend](#aarch64-support).; This support is used to implement the Darwin arm64e ABI, as well as the; [PAuth ABI Extension to ELF](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/pauthabielf64/pauthabielf64.rst). ## LLVM IR Representation. ### Intrinsics.

Security,"# Python Interface; \index{Python}. Python is a popular, open-source, dynamic programming language with an; interactive interpreter. Its interoperability with other programming; languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is; excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have; therefore so-called ""Python bindings."" PyROOT provides Python bindings; for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice; versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of; user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables; access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python; bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from; the python interpreter. ## PyROOT Overview. The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming,; including high performance and distributed parallel code (see; <http://www.scipy.org>). It is the second most popular scripting; language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a ""glue language"":; practically every library and application these days comes with Python; bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated). `PyROOT`, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT; class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it; allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus; the ""glue-ing"" of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or; applications that provide Python bindings. Further, `PyROOT` can be; loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary); access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of; `PyROOT` is through a few examples. ### Glue-ing Applications. The `PyQt` library, see <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt>,; provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework (; <http://www.trolltech.com>).

Security,"# ROOT in Python #. ROOT offers the possibility to interface to Python via a set of bindings called; PyROOT.; Python is used in a wide variety of application areas and one of the most used; scripting languages today.; With the help of PyROOT it becomes possible to combine the power of a scripting; language with ROOT tools. Introductory material to Python is available from many; sources on the web, see e. g. http://docs.python.org. ## PyROOT ##. The access to ROOT classes and their methods in PyROOT is almost identical to C++; macros, except for the special language features of Python, most importantly dynamic; type declaration at the time of assignment. Coming back to our first example, simply; plotting a function in ROOT, the following C++ code:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 *f1 = new TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.);; f1->SetParameter(0,1);; f1->SetParameter(1,1);; f1->Draw();; ```. in Python becomes:. ``` {.python}; import ROOT; f1 = ROOT.TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.); f1.SetParameter(0,1);; f1.SetParameter(1,1);; f1.Draw();; ```. A slightly more advanced example hands over data defined in the macro to the ROOT; class `TGraphErrors`. Note that a Python array can be used to pass data between; Python and ROOT. The first line in the Python script allows it to be executed; directly from the operating system, without the need to start the script from; python or the highly recommended powerful interactive shell ipython. The last line; in the python script is there to allow you to have a look at the graphical output; in the ROOT canvas before it disappears upon termination of the script. Here is the C++ version:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.C; ```. In Python it looks like this:. ``` {.python}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.py; ```.

These; exploits are currently broken down into three variants:; * GPZ Variant #1 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #1): Bounds check (or predicate) bypass; * GPZ Variant #2 (a.k.a.

For more details, see the Google Project Zero blog post and the Spectre research; paper:; * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html; * https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf.

This path; is speculatively executed with the available data, and may load from memory and; leak the loaded values through various side channels that survive even when the; speculative execution is unwound due to being incorrect.

Security,"# Trees. ## Why Should You Use a Tree?. In the ""Input/Output"" chapter, we saw how objects can be saved in ROOT; files. In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects,; ROOT has designed the **`TTree`** and **`TNtuple`** classes specifically; for that purpose. The **`TTree`** class is optimized to reduce disk; space and enhance access speed. A **`TNtuple`** is a **`TTree`** that is; limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a **`TTree`** on the other; hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to; all the simple types. When using a **`TTree`**, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and; the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and; leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is; important to realize that each object is not written individually, but; rather collected and written a bunch at a time. This is where the **`TTree`** takes advantage of compression and will; produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written; individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the; **`TTree`** contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects; can be compressed. The **`TTree`** reduces the header of each object, but it still contains; the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class; object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression; algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using; a **`TTree`** and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes; compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned; off, you will not see these large savings. The **`TTree`** is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a; hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from; any other branch.

ROOT executables will get the config automatically, using a static version of the config library, `libROOTStaticSanitizerConfig.a`.; All ROOT executables statically link against it, so they start up without reporting lots of unfixable memory leaks (e.g. llvm). #### Small linker magic to get the config symbols into ROOT's executables; When linking a ROOT executable, the setup functions from the sanitiser config library might get ignored, because they are not used in any of our executables.; In `cmake/modules/SetUp{Linux|MacOS}.cmake`, the functions are therefore marked as ""undefined"" for the linker, so it starts copying; them into all ROOT executables.; This way, root.exe, cling, ... can start up with a sane default config. ### Use your own address/leak sanitizer configuration; The default configurations can be overridden using the environment variables `ASAN_OPTIONS` and `LSAN_OPTIONS`.

All the fixes and improvements in the PROOF system occured since the release of 5.34/00 are available both in the latest 5.34 tags and in 6.00/00.; The following is a summary of the major modifications since 5.34 . ### New developments/functionality. - Several improvements in the merging phase; in particular:; - Modification of output sending protocol to control memory usage, significantly reducing the memory footprint on the master, in particular when merging; large numbers of histograms.; - Use an hash table for the output list to significantly speed up names lookups during merging.; - Add support for dynamic addition of workers to a currently running process (currently supported by the unit packetizer).; - Automatization of the usage of file-based technology to handle outputs.; - [Improved dataset management model](https://root.cern/doc/v628/classTDataSetManagerAliEn.html); where the PROOF (ROOT) dataset manager is a light frontend to the experiment file catalogs; TDataSetManagerFile is still; used as local cache of the experiment information or to store the work-in-progress status of the dataset manager daemon. This model addresses the scalability issues observed at ALICE AFs.; - Improvements in [TProofBench](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTProofBench.html):; - Recording and display of the maximum rate during query, CPU efficiency calculation for PROOF-Lite runs, better measurement of wall time.; - Support for dynamic startup mode. - Test program xpdtest to test the status of xproofd (see also man page under $ROOTSYS/man/man1):. ``` {.sh}; $ xpdtest [options]; --help, -h; Gives a short list of options avaliable, and exit; -t <test>; type of test to be run:; 0 ping the daemon (includes process existence check if pid specified; see below); 1 ping the daemon and check connection for default user; 2 ping the daemon and check connection for the default user and all recent users; ...; ```; - Interface with **igprof** for fast statistic profiling.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/proof/doc/v600/index.md:522,hash,hash,522,proof/doc/v600/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/proof/doc/v600/index.md,1,['hash'],['hash']

ROOT offers a new class `TTreeReader` that gives simple, safe and fast access to the content of a `TTree`.; Using it is trivial:. ``` {.cpp}; #include ""TFile.h""; #include ""TH1F.h""; #include ""TTreeReader.h""; #include ""TTreeReaderValue.h"". void hsimpleReader() {; TH1F *myHist = new TH1F(""h1"",""ntuple"",100,-4,4);; TFile *myFile = TFile::Open(""hsimple.root"");. // Create a TTreeReader for the tree, for instance by passing the; // TTree's name and the TDirectory / TFile it is in.; TTreeReader myReader(""ntuple"", myFile);. // The branch ""px"" contains floats; access them as myPx.; TTreeReaderValue<Float_t> myPx(myReader, ""px"");; // The branch ""py"" contains floats, too; access those as myPy.; TTreeReaderValue<Float_t> myPy(myReader, ""py"");. // Loop over all entries of the TTree or TChain.; while (myReader.Next()) {; // Just access the data as if myPx and myPy were iterators (note the '*'; // in front of them):; myHist->Fill(*myPx + *myPy);; }. myHist->Draw();; }; ```. TTreeReader checks whether the type that you expect can be extracted from the tree's branch and will clearly complain if not.; It reads on demand: only data that are actually needed are read, there is no need for `SetBranchStatus()`, `SetBranchAddress()`, `LoadTree()` or anything alike.; It uses the memory management of TTree, removing possible double deletions or memory leaks and relieveing you from the need to manage the memory yourself.; It turns on the tree cache, accelerating the reading of data.; It has been extensively tested on all known types of TTree branches and is thus a generic, fits-all access method for data stored in TTrees. ### TTreePlayer. - The TEntryList for ||-Coord plot was not defined correctly.

Both sets return the same values but the first set is; more relevant for use where **`TLorentzVector`** describes a combination; of position and time and the second set is more relevant where; **`TLorentzVector`** describes momentum and energy:. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t xx =v.X();; ...; Double_t tt = v.T();; Double_t px = v.Px();; ...; Double_t ee = v.E();; ```.

You can use the `Vect()` method to get the vector component of; **`TLorentzVector`**:. ``` {.cpp}; TVector3 p = v.Vect();; ```. For setting components there are two methods: `SetX(),.., SetPx(),..:`. ``` {.cpp}; v.SetX(1.); orv.SetPx(1.);; ......; v.SetT(1.);v.SetE(1.);; ```.

The; parsing time of the library is directly proportional to the number of; arguments parsed, not the number of options recognized. Additionally,; command line argument values are captured transparently into user defined; global variables, which can be accessed like any other variable (and with the; same performance). #. Type Safe: As a user of CommandLine, you don't have to worry about; remembering the type of arguments that you want (is it an int? a string? a; bool? an enum?) and keep casting it around. Not only does this help prevent; error prone constructs, it also leads to dramatically cleaner source code. #. No subclasses required: To use CommandLine, you instantiate variables that; correspond to the arguments that you would like to capture, you don't; subclass a parser. This means that you don't have to write **any**; boilerplate code. #. Globally accessible: Libraries can specify command line arguments that are; automatically enabled in any tool that links to the library. This is; possible because the application doesn't have to keep a list of arguments to; pass to the parser. This also makes supporting `dynamically loaded options`_; trivial. #. Cleaner: CommandLine supports enum and other types directly, meaning that; there is less error and more security built into the library.

In each case the second operand is the pointer through which the GEP instruction; starts. The same is true whether the second operand is an argument, allocated; memory, or a global variable. To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global i32; ...; %idx1 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 0; %idx2 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 1; %idx3 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 2. These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the base; address of ``MyVar``. They compute, as follows (using C syntax):. .. code-block:: c++. idx1 = (char*) &MyVar + 0; idx2 = (char*) &MyVar + 4; idx3 = (char*) &MyVar + 8. Since the type ``i32`` is known to be four bytes long, the indices 0, 1 and 2; translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No memory is; accessed to make these computations because the address of ``@MyVar`` is passed; directly to the GEP instructions. The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of ``%idx2`` and ``%idx3``. They; result in the computation of addresses that point to memory past the end of the; ``@MyVar`` global, which is only one ``i32`` long, not three ``i32``\s long.; While this is legal in LLVM, it is inadvisable because any load or store with; the pointer that results from these GEP instructions would trigger undefined; behavior (UB). Why is the extra 0 index required?; ----------------------------------. Quick answer: there are no superfluous indices. This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a global; variable which is always a pointer type. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. %MyStruct = external global { ptr, i32 }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { ptr, i32 }, ptr %MyStruct, i64 0, i32 1.

Memory Management with JITLinkMemoryManager; -------------------------------------------. JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs. To satisfy these requirements ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` adopts the following; design: The memory manager itself has just two virtual methods for asynchronous; operations (each with convenience overloads for calling synchronously):. .. code-block:: c++. /// Called when allocation has been completed.; using OnAllocatedFunction =; unique_function<void(Expected<std::unique_ptr<InFlightAlloc>)>;. /// Called when deallocation has completed.; using OnDeallocatedFunction = unique_function<void(Error)>;. /// Call to allocate memory.; virtual void allocate(const JITLinkDylib *JD, LinkGraph &G,; OnAllocatedFunction OnAllocated) = 0;. /// Call to deallocate memory.; virtual void deallocate(std::vector<FinalizedAlloc> Allocs,; OnDeallocatedFunction OnDeallocated) = 0;.

The ``JITLinkContext`` can use this flag to determine; whether this symbol definition should be kept or dropped. * ``Scope`` is one of *Default*, *Hidden*, or *Local*, and is accessible via; the ``getScope`` method. The ``JITLinkContext`` can use this to determine; who should be able to see the symbol. A symbol with default scope should be; globally visible.

One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option. Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/th2ul.json.gz"";; let obj = await httpRequest(filename, 'object');; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""lego"");; ```. In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```.

On the other hand, the internal M minimizing routines only want to; ""see"" variable parameters without limits, and so they have access only; to the *internal parameter list* which is created from the external list; by the following transformation:. - Squeeze out all parameters that are not variable. - Transform all variable parameters with limits, so that the; transformed parameter can vary without limits. (See the next section; for details concerning this transformation.) Because this; transformation is non-linear, it is recommended to avoid putting; limits on parameters where they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely variable. - Parameter 2, variable with limits. - Parameter 3, constant. - Parameter 4, freely variable.

This utility uses page-granular lazy initialization; when the element is accessed. When the number of used pages is small; significant memory savings can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used). Moreover, while retaining the order of the elements based on their insertion; index, like a vector, iterating over the elements via ``begin()`` and ``end()``; is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``. Finally a ``materialized_begin()`` and ``materialized_end`` iterators are; provided to access the elements associated to the accessed pages, which could; speed up operations that need to iterate over initialized elements in a; non-ordered manner. .. _dss_vec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:63732,access,accessing,63732,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['access'],['accessing']

(Such a set of operations comprises a *release; sequence*). This corresponds to the C/C++; ``memory_order_release``.; ``acq_rel`` (acquire+release); Acts as both an ``acquire`` and ``release`` operation on its; address. This corresponds to the C/C++ ``memory_order_acq_rel``.; ``seq_cst`` (sequentially consistent); In addition to the guarantees of ``acq_rel`` (``acquire`` for an; operation that only reads, ``release`` for an operation that only; writes), there is a global total order on all; sequentially-consistent operations on all addresses. Each; sequentially-consistent read sees the last preceding write to the; same address in this global order. This corresponds to the C/C++; ``memory_order_seq_cst`` and Java ``volatile``. Note: this global total order is *not* guaranteed to be fully; consistent with the *happens-before* partial order if; non-``seq_cst`` accesses are involved.

Security,"++ does not garbage; collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object; becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object,; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no; longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other; object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Although we chose to call our pointer `my_objptr`, to emphasize that; it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```. As we have seen, heap objects; have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be; accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; ```. Here we have a `Quad` pointer that has been initialized with the; address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of; stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically,; which could leave you with an illegal pointer. Using it will corrupt; and may as well crash the program!. It is time to look at the destruction of objects. A destructor is a; special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an; object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the; object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a; destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to; our Quad class so that we can see when it is called.

Structures may optionally be ""packed"" structures, which indicate that; the alignment of the struct is one byte, and that there is no padding; between the elements. In non-packed structs, padding between field types; is inserted as defined by the DataLayout string in the module, which is; required to match what the underlying code generator expects. Structures can either be ""literal"" or ""identified"". A literal structure; is defined inline with other types (e.g. ``[2 x {i32, i32}]``) whereas; identified types are always defined at the top level with a name.; Literal types are uniqued by their contents and can never be recursive; or opaque since there is no way to write one.

This combination provides the several nice properties: the result data is; contiguous in memory (good for cache locality), has few allocations, is easy to; address (iterators in the final vector are just indices or pointers), and can be; efficiently queried with a standard binary search (e.g.; ``std::lower_bound``; if you want the whole range of elements comparing; equal, use ``std::equal_range``). .. _dss_smallset:. llvm/ADT/SmallSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Security,"-----------------------------------------. Introduction; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Objective C provides a simpler way to declare and define accessor methods using; declared properties. The language provides features to declare a property and; to let compiler synthesize accessor methods. The debugger lets developer inspect Objective C interfaces and their instance; variables and class variables. However, the debugger does not know anything; about the properties defined in Objective C interfaces. The debugger consumes; information generated by compiler in DWARF format. The format does not support; encoding of Objective C properties. This proposal describes DWARF extensions to; encode Objective C properties, which the debugger can use to let developers; inspect Objective C properties. Proposal; ^^^^^^^^. Objective C properties exist separately from class members. A property can be; defined only by ""setter"" and ""getter"" selectors, and be calculated anew on each; access. Or a property can just be a direct access to some declared ivar.; Finally it can have an ivar ""automatically synthesized"" for it by the compiler,; in which case the property can be referred to in user code directly using the; standard C dereference syntax as well as through the property ""dot"" syntax, but; there is no entry in the ``@interface`` declaration corresponding to this ivar. To facilitate debugging, these properties we will add a new DWARF TAG into the; ``DW_TAG_structure_type`` definition for the class to hold the description of a; given property, and a set of DWARF attributes that provide said description.; The property tag will also contain the name and declared type of the property. If there is a related ivar, there will also be a DWARF property attribute placed; in the ``DW_TAG_member`` DIE for that ivar referring back to the property TAG; for that property. And in the case where the compiler synthesizes the ivar; directly, the compiler is expected to generate a ``DW_TAG_member`` for that; ivar (with th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:50186,access,access,50186,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"---------------------. We use an 8-bit unsigned integer for the representation of a; label. The label identifier 0 is special, and means that the data item; is unlabelled. This is optimizing for low CPU and code size overhead; of the instrumentation. When a label union operation is requested at a; join point (any arithmetic or logical operation with two or more; operands, such as addition), we can simply OR the two labels in O(1). Users are responsible for managing the 8 integer labels (i.e., keeping; track of what labels they have used so far, picking one that is yet; unused, etc). Origin tracking trace representation; ------------------------------------. An origin tracking trace is a list of chains. Each chain has a stack trace; where the DFSan runtime records a label propagation, and a pointer to its; previous chain. The very first chain does not point to any chain. Every four 4-bytes aligned application bytes share a 4-byte origin trace ID. A; 4-byte origin trace ID contains a 4-bit depth and a 28-bit hash ID of a chain. A chain ID is calculated as a hash from a chain structure. A chain structure; contains a stack ID and the previous chain ID. The chain head has a zero; previous chain ID. A stack ID is a hash from a stack trace. The 4-bit depth; limits the maximal length of a path. The environment variable ``origin_history_size``; can set the depth limit. Non-positive values mean unlimited. Its default value; is 16. When reaching the limit, origin tracking ignores following propagation; chains. The first chain of a trace starts by `dfsan_set_label` with non-zero labels. A; new chain is appended at the end of a trace at stores or memory transfers when; ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 1. Memory transfers include LLVM memory transfer; instructions, glibc memcpy and memmove. When ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 2, a; new chain is also appended at loads. Other instructions do not create new chains, but simply propagate origin trace; IDs.

Disabling Instrumentation with ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""address"")))``; --------------------------------------------------------------------------. Some code should not be instrumented by AddressSanitizer. One may use; the attribute ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""address"")))`` (which has; deprecated synonyms `no_sanitize_address` and; `no_address_safety_analysis`) to disable instrumentation of a; particular function. This attribute may not be supported by other; compilers, so we suggest to use it together with; ``__has_feature(address_sanitizer)``. The same attribute used on a global variable prevents AddressSanitizer; from adding redzones around it and detecting out of bounds accesses. AddressSanitizer also supports; ``__attribute__((disable_sanitizer_instrumentation))``. This attribute; works similar to ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""address"")))``, but it also; prevents instrumentation performed by other sanitizers. Suppressing Errors in Recompiled Code (Ignorelist); --------------------------------------------------. AddressSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress error reports; in the specified source files or functions. Additionally, AddressSanitizer; introduces ``global`` and ``type`` entity types that can be used to; suppress error reports for out-of-bound access to globals with certain; names and types (you may only specify class or struct types).

Security,"-----------------. By default, all command line options automatically hold the value that they; parse from the command line. This is very convenient in the common case,; especially when combined with the ability to define command line options in the; files that use them. This is called the internal storage model. Sometimes, however, it is nice to separate the command line option processing; code from the storage of the value parsed. For example, lets say that we have a; '``-debug``' option that we would like to use to enable debug information across; the entire body of our program. In this case, the boolean value controlling the; debug code should be globally accessible (in a header file, for example) yet the; command line option processing code should not be exposed to all of these; clients (requiring lots of .cpp files to ``#include CommandLine.h``). To do this, set up your .h file with your option, like this for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // DebugFlag.h - Get access to the '-debug' command line option; //. // DebugFlag - This boolean is set to true if the '-debug' command line option; // is specified. This should probably not be referenced directly, instead, use; // the DEBUG macro below.; //; extern bool DebugFlag;. // DEBUG macro - This macro should be used by code to emit debug information.; // In the '-debug' option is specified on the command line, and if this is a; // debug build, then the code specified as the option to the macro will be; // executed. Otherwise it will not be.; #ifdef NDEBUG; #define LLVM_DEBUG(X); #else; #define LLVM_DEBUG(X) do { if (DebugFlag) { X; } } while (0); #endif. This allows clients to blissfully use the ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macro, or the; ``DebugFlag`` explicitly if they want to. Now we just need to be able to set; the ``DebugFlag`` boolean when the option is set. To do this, we pass an; additional argument to our command line argument processor, and we specify where; to fill in with the `cl::location`_ attribute:. .. code-block",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:33994,access,access,33994,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"-----------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header. Care has been taken to remove all such ``#includes`` from LLVM; while ``lib/Support`` was being developed. Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------. The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Support`` interfaces. Use Standard C++ Headers; ------------------------. The **standard** C++ headers from the standard C++ library and standard; template library may be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface.

However, the two tools occupy different points; on the design space; ``-fsanitize=function`` is a developer tool designed; to find bugs in local development builds, whereas ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall``; is a security hardening mechanism designed to be deployed in release builds. ``-fsanitize=function`` has a higher space and time overhead due to a more; complex type check at indirect call sites, which may make it unsuitable for; deployment. On the other hand, ``-fsanitize=function`` conforms more closely with the C++; standard and user expectations around interaction with shared libraries;; the identity of function pointers is maintained, and calls across shared; library boundaries are no different from calls within a single program or; shared library. .. _kcfi:. ``-fsanitize=kcfi``; -------------------. This is an alternative indirect call control-flow integrity scheme designed; for low-level system software, such as operating system kernels.

These properties make KCFI easier to; adopt in low-level software. KCFI is limited to checking only function; pointers, and isn't compatible with executable-only memory. Member Function Pointer Call Checking; =====================================. This scheme checks that indirect calls via a member function pointer; take place using an object of the correct dynamic type. Specifically, we; check that the dynamic type of the member function referenced by the member; function pointer matches the ""function pointer"" part of the member function; pointer, and that the member function's class type is related to the base; type of the member function.

The most common way to build the fuzzers is; by adding the following two flags to your CMake invocation:; ``-DLLVM_USE_SANITIZER=Address -DLLVM_USE_SANITIZE_COVERAGE=On``. .. note:: If you have ``compiler-rt`` checked out in an LLVM tree when building; with sanitizers, you'll want to specify ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=Off``; to avoid building the sanitizers themselves with sanitizers enabled. .. note:: You may run into issues if you build with BFD ld, which is the; default linker on many unix systems. These issues are being tracked; in https://llvm.org/PR34636. Continuously Running and Finding Bugs; -------------------------------------.

Security,"-----. JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features. For example:. * Relaxation optimizations -- A pre-fixup pass can inspect GOT accesses and PLT; calls and identify situations where the addresses of the entry target and the; access are close enough to be accessed directly. In this case the pass can; rewrite the instruction stream of the containing block and update the fixup; edges to make the access direct. Code for this looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Error relaxGOTEdges(LinkGraph &G) {; for (auto *B : G.blocks()); for (auto &E : B->edges()); if (E.getKind() == x86_64::GOTLoad) {; auto &GOTTarget = getGOTEntryTarget(E.getTarget());; if (isInRange(B.getFixupAddress(E), GOTTarget)) {; // Rewrite B.getContent() at fixup address from; // MOVQ to LEAQ. // Update edge target and kind.; E.setTarget(GOTTarget);; E.setKind(x86_64::PCRel32);; }; }. return Error::success();; }. * Metadata registration -- Post allocation passes can be used to record the; address range of sections in the target. This can be used to register the; metadata (e.g exception handling frames, language metadata) in the target; once memory has been finalized. .. code-block:: c++.

Inspired by a similar implementation in `Cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`_,; this feature added to upstream Clang repo has essentially extended the syntax of; C++, so that it can be more helpful for people that are writing code for data; science applications. This is useful, for example, when you want to experiment with a set of values; against a set of functions, and you'd like to know the results right away.; This is similar to how Python works (hence its popularity in data science; research), but the superior performance of C++, along with this flexibility; makes it a more attractive option. Implementation Details; ======================. Parsing mechanism:; ------------------. The Interpreter in Clang-Repl (``Interpreter.cpp``) includes the function; ``ParseAndExecute()`` that can accept a 'Value' parameter to capture the result.; But if the value parameter is made optional and it is omitted (i.e., that the; user does not want to utilize it elsewhere), then the last value can be; validated and pushed into the ``dump()`` function. .. graphviz::; :name: parsing; :caption: Parsing Mechanism; :alt: Shows the Parsing Mechanism for Pretty Printing; :align: center. digraph ""prettyprint"" {; rankdir=""LR"";; graph [fontname=""Verdana"", fontsize=""12""];; node [fontname=""Verdana"", fontsize=""12""];; edge [fontname=""Verdana"", fontsize=""9""];. parse [label="" ParseAndExecute() \n in Clang "", shape=""box""];; capture [label="" Capture 'Value' parameter \n for processing?

The problem with this layout for debuggers is that we need to optimize for the; negative lookup case where the symbol we're searching for is not present. So; if we were to lookup ""``printf``"" in the table above, we would make a 32-bit; hash for ""``printf``"", it might match ``bucket[3]``. We would need to go to; the offset 0x000034f0 and start looking to see if our 32 bit hash matches. To; do so, we need to read the next pointer, then read the hash, compare it, and; skip to the next bucket. Each time we are skipping many bytes in memory and; touching new pages just to do the compare on the full 32 bit hash. All of; these accesses then tell us that we didn't have a match. Name Hash Tables; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

The use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the; object that is used for filling must be given to the **`TTree::Branch()`**; call, even though the formal argument is declared a '`void*'`. In the; case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary,; because the full type information is available, and `TTree::Branch()`; has been Pythonized to take care of the call details. However, data; members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require; something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive; types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that; purpose, there is the `AddressOf()` function. As an example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from ROOT import gROOT, AddressOf. gROOT.ProcessLine(; ""struct MyStruct { Int_t fMyInt1; Int_t fMyInt2; Int_t fMyInt3; Char_t fMyCode[4]; };"" );. from ROOT import MyStruct; mystruct = MyStruct(); f = TFile('mytree.root','RECREATE'); tree = TTree('T','Just A Tree'); tree.Branch('myints',mystruct,'MyInt1/I:MyInt2:MyInt3'); tree.Branch('mycode',AddressOf(mystruct,'fMyCode'),'MyCode/C'); for i in range(0,10):; mystruct.fMyInt1 = i; mystruct.fMyInt2 = i*i; mystruct.fMyInt3 = i*i*i; mystruct.fMyCode = ""%03d"" % i # note string assignment. tree.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); ```.

By default, ROOT now falls back to the built-in version of xrootd if it can't find it in the system.; This means that passing `-Dbuiltin_xrootd=ON` is not necessary anymore to build ROOT with xrootd support.; Note that built-in xrootd requires a working network connection. ### Experimental address sanitizer build configuration; Added a build flag `asan` that switches on address sanitizer. It's experimental, so expect problems. For example, when building with gcc,; manipulations in global variables in llvm will abort the build. Such checks can be disabled using environment variables. Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation. Even more includes will be ""hidden"" when ROOT configured with `-Ddev=ON` build option.; In that case ROOT uses `#ifdef R__LESS_INCLUDES` to replace unused includes by class forward declarations.; Such `dev` builds ca",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:8088,sanitiz,sanitizer,8088,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,1,['sanitiz'],['sanitizer']

All the static images have been replaced; by macros generating images at reference guide build time.

When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`.

Like SparseSet, it typically uses a lot of memory, but; provides operations that are almost as fast as a vector. Typical keys are; physical registers, virtual registers, or numbered basic blocks. SparseMultiSet is useful for algorithms that need very fast; clear/find/insert/erase of the entire collection, and iteration over sets of; elements sharing a key.

FoldingSet is an aggregate class that is really good at uniquing; expensive-to-create or polymorphic objects.

Consider a case where you want to implement a ""getOrCreateFoo"" method for a; complex object (for example, a node in the code generator). The client has a; description of **what** it wants to generate (it knows the opcode and all the; operands), but we don't want to 'new' a node, then try inserting it into a set; only to find out it already exists, at which point we would have to delete it; and return the node that already exists. To support this style of client, FoldingSet perform a query with a; FoldingSetNodeID (which wraps SmallVector) that can be used to describe the; element that we want to query for. The query either returns the element; matching the ID or it returns an opaque ID that indicates where insertion should; take place. Construction of the ID usually does not require heap traffic.

Certain memory accesses, such as :ref:`load <i_load>`'s,; :ref:`store <i_store>`'s, and :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`'s may be; marked ``volatile``. The optimizers must not change the number of; volatile operations or change their order of execution relative to other; volatile operations. The optimizers *may* change the order of volatile; operations relative to non-volatile operations. This is not Java's; ""volatile"" and has no cross-thread synchronization behavior. A volatile load or store may have additional target-specific semantics.; Any volatile operation can have side effects, and any volatile operation; can read and/or modify state which is not accessible via a regular load; or store in this module. Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited. If a; non-volatile store to a given address would be legal, a volatile; operation may modify the memory at that address. A volatile operation; may not modify any other memory accessible by the module being compiled.; A volatile operation may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation.

Security,". Each set of data has a producer class and one or many; consumer classes. When using folders, the producer class places a; pointer to the data into a folder, and the consumer class retrieves a; reference to the folder. The consumer can access the objects in a folder by specifying the path; name of the folder. Here is an example of a folder's path name:. `//root/Event/Hits/TCP`. One does not have to specify the full path name. If the partial path; name is unique, it will find it; otherwise it will return the first; occurrence of the path. The first diagram shows a system without folders. The objects have; pointers to each other to access each other's data. Pointers are an; efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer; creates a direct coupling between classes. This design can become a very; tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. ![](pictures/020000E2.jpg). In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the; consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data.; The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy; provides an alternative. It loosely couples the classes and greatly; enhances I/O operations. In this way, folders separate the data from the; algorithms and greatly improve the modularity of an application by; minimizing the class dependencies. ![](pictures/020000E3.jpg). In addition, the folder hierarchy creates a picture of the data; organization. This is useful when discussing data design issues or when; learning the data organization. The example below illustrates this; point. ## How to Use Folders. Using folders means to build a hierarchy of folders, posting the; reference to the data in the folder by the producer, and creating a; reference to the folder by the user. ### Creating a Folder Hierarchy. To create a folder hierarchy you add the top folder of your hierarchy to; `//root`.

The expected increases in execution speed range from; roughly 20% (for problems that were already implemented in a close-to optimal form) to more than 2000%; for certain type of problems. Below is a summary of the changes made. All of these changes are; transparent to end-use cases ; ; ; New implementation of RooFit data types. The implementation of data stored in RooDataSet and RooDataHist; was historically handled by ROOT TTrees (though class RooTreeDataStore). The default storage type; has now been changed to class RooVectorDataStore which stores the information in STL arrays. Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs.

One of the simplest and most common extensions is the use of a custom parser.; As `discussed previously`_, parsers are the portion of the CommandLine library; that turns string input from the user into a particular parsed data type,; validating the input in the process. There are two ways to use a new parser:. #. Specialize the `cl::parser`_ template for your custom data type. This approach has the advantage that users of your custom data type will; automatically use your custom parser whenever they define an option with a; value type of your data type. The disadvantage of this approach is that it; doesn't work if your fundamental data type is something that is already; supported. #. Write an independent class, using it explicitly from options that need it.

Installation; ============. cppyy requires a (modern) C++ compiler.; When installing through `conda-forge`_, ``conda`` will install the compiler; for you, to match the other conda-forge packages.; When using ``pip`` and the wheels from `PyPI`_, you minimally need gcc5,; clang5, or MSVC'17. .. note::. On Windows, a command prompt from which to run Python (or Python run; directly) needs to be opened from within an environment with MSVC setup,; otherwise the compiler will not be accessible. When installing from source, the only requirement is a compiler that supports; C++14, this in order to build LLVM. With CPython on Linux or MacOS, probably by far the easiest way to install; cppyy, is through conda-forge on `Anaconda`_ (or `miniconda`_).; A Windows recipe for ``conda`` is not available yet, but is forthcoming, so; use ``pip`` for that platform for now (see below).; PyPI always has the authoritative releases (conda-forge pulls the sources; from there), so conda-forge may sometimes lag PyPI.; If you absolutely need the latest release, use PyPI or consider; :ref:`building from source <building_from_source>`. To install using ``conda``, create and/or activate your (new) work environment; and install from the conda-forge channel::. $ conda create -n WORK; $ conda activate WORK; (WORK) $ conda install -c conda-forge cppyy; (WORK) [current compiler] $. To install with ``pip`` through `PyPI`_, use `venv`.; The use of virtual environment (`venv`) prevents pollution of any system directories and allows; you to wipe out the full installation simply by removing the virtual environment (`venv`); created directory (""WORK"" in this example)::. $ python -m venv WORK ; $ WORK\Scripts\activate; (WORK) $ python -m pip install cppyy; (WORK) $. .. note:: ; If you are using python version less than 3.3, you should use `virtualenv` instead of `venv`.; First install virtualenv package that allows you to create virtual environment. $ python -m pip install virtualenv . $ vir",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst:500,access,accessible,500,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst,1,['access'],['accessible']

Top Level; =========. cppyy provides a couple of helper functions at the module level that provide; (direct) access to the Cling interpreter (any C++ code is always accessed; through the global namespace ``cppyy.gbl``).; The documentation makes use of these helpers throughout, so they are listed; here first, but their documentation is more conveniently accessible through; the Python interpreter itself, using the ``help()`` function::. $ python; >>> import cppyy; >>> help(cppyy). `Loading C++`; -------------. C++ code can be loaded as text to be JITed, or be compiled ahead of time and; supplied in the form of a shared library.; In the latter case, C++ headers need to be loaded as well to declare; classes, functions, and variables to Cling.; Instead of headers, pre-compiled code can be used; in particular all of the; standard C++ headers and several system headers are pre-compiled at startup.; cppyy provides the following helpers to load C++ code:. * ``cppdef``: direct access to the interpreter.; This function accepts C++ declarations as a string and JITs them (bindings; are not created until actual use).; The code is loaded into the global scope, thus any previously loaded code; is available from one ``cppdef`` call to the next, as are all standard; C++ headers that have been loaded through pre-compiled headers.; Example::. >>> cppyy.cppdef(r""""""\; ... void hello() {; ... std::cout << ""Hello, World!"" << std::endl;; ... }""""""); True; >>> cppyy.gbl.hello(); Hello, World!; >>> . * ``cppexec``: direct access to the interpreter.; This function accepts C++ statements as a string, JITs and executes them.; Just like ``cppdef``, execution is in the global scope and all previously; loaded code is available.; If the statements are declarations, the effect is the same as ``cppdef``,; but ``cppexec`` also accepts executable lines.; Example::. >>> cppyy.cppexec(r""""""std::string hello = ""Hello, World!"";""""""); True; >>> cppyy.cppexec(""std::cout << hello << std::endl;""); He",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst:124,access,access,124,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst,4,['access'],"['access', 'accessed', 'accessible']"

Most type conversions are done automatically, e.g. between Python ``str``; and C++ ``std::string`` and ``const char*``, but low-level APIs exist to; perform explicit conversions.

Object pointer returns from functions provide the most derived class known; (i.e. exposed in header files) in the hierarchy of the object being returned.; This is important to preserve object identity as well as to make casting,; a pure C++ feature after all, superfluous.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Abstract, Concrete; >>> c = Concrete(); >>> Concrete.show_autocast.__doc__; 'Abstract* Concrete::show_autocast()'; >>> d = c.show_autocast(); >>> type(d); <class '__main__.Concrete'>; >>>. As a consequence, if your C++ classes should only be used through their; interfaces, then no bindings should be provided to the concrete classes; (e.g. by excluding them using a :ref:`selection file <selection-files>`).; Otherwise, more functionality will be available in Python than in C++. Sometimes, however, full control over a cast is needed.; For example, if the instance is bound by another tool or even a 3rd party,; hand-written, extension library.; Assuming the object supports the ``PyCapsule`` or ``CObject`` abstraction,; then a C++-style reinterpret_cast (i.e. without implicitly taking offsets; into account), can be done by taking and rebinding the address of an; object:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy import addressof, bind_object; >>> e = bind_object(addressof(d), Abstract); >>> type(e); <class '__main__.Abstract'>; >>>. `Operators`; ---",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/type_conversions.rst:693,expose,exposed,693,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/type_conversions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/type_conversions.rst,1,['expose'],['exposed']

A `dictionary` is a generated C++ source file containing references to the; header locations used when building (and any additional locations provided),; a set of forward declarations to reduce the need of loading header files, and; a few I/O helper functions.; The name ""dictionary"" is historic: before ``cling`` was used, it contained; the complete generated C++ reflection information, whereas now that is; derived at run-time from the header files.; It is still possible to fully embed header files rather than only storing; their names and search locations, to make the dictionary more self-contained. After generating the dictionary, it should be compiled into a shared library.; This provides additional dependency control: by linking it directly with any; further libraries needed, you can use standard mechanisms such as ``rpath``; to locate those library dependencies.; Alternatively, you can add the additional libraries to load to the mapping; files of the class load",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst:409,access,access,409,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst,1,['access'],['access']

That pointer; must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices through it; transparently. To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;. Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent pointers; won't be dereferenced?*. The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to perform the; computation. The second operand to the GEP instruction must be a value of a; pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %str",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:2338,access,accessing,2338,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['access'],['accessing']

This utility uses page-granular lazy initialization; when the element is accessed. When the number of used pages is small; significant memory savings can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used).

Future tables could include more information about the; DIE such as flags indicating if the DIE is a function, method, block,; or inlined.

So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad. To handle this, either define a custom derivative for that external function,; or find a way to expose it to Clad. An example of this can be seen with `gamma_cdf()` in MathFuncs.h`,; for which the custom derivative is not supported, but in this specific; instance, it falls back to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:27914,expose,expose,27914,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security,".insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s. This reduces; indentation in the body of the file for source editors that indent based on; braces, and keeps the conceptual context cleaner. The general form of this rule; is that any ``.cpp`` file that implements code in any namespace may use that; namespace (and its parents'), but should not use any others.

ROOT looks for scripts in the path specified in the `.rootrc` file in; the `Root.Macro.Path` variable. You can expand this path to hold your; own directories. ### Logon and Logoff Scripts. The `rootlogon.C` and `rootlogoff.C` files are scripts loaded and; executed at start-up and shutdown. The `rootalias.C` file is loaded; but not executed. It typically contains small utility functions. For; example, the `rootalias.C` script that comes with the ROOT; distributions (located in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials)` defines the function; `edit(char *file)`. This allows the user to call the editor from the; command line. This particular function will start the VI editor if the; environment variable `EDITOR` is not set. ``` {.cpp}; root[0] edit(""c1.C""); ```. For more details, see `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/rootalias.C`. ### History File. You can use the up and down arrow at the command line, to access the; previous and next command. The commands are recorded in the history; file `$HOME/.root_hist`. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and; paste from it. You can specify the history file in the `system.rootrc`; file, by setting the `Rint.History `option. You can also turn off the; command logging in the `system.rootrc` file with the option:; `Rint.History: -`. The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in `.rootrc`; by:. ```; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; ```. The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached; all, the last `HistSave` lines will be removed. One can set `HistSize`; to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an; environment variable called `ROOT_HIST`. By setting; `ROOT_HIST=300:200` the above values can be overriden - the first; value corresponds to `HistSize`, the (optional) second one to; `HistSave`.

Make sure to use ``clang++`` (not ``ld``) as a linker, so that your; executable is linked with proper UBSan runtime libraries, unless all enabled; checks use trap mode. You can use ``clang`` instead of ``clang++`` if you're; compiling/linking C code. .. code-block:: console. % cat test.cc; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; int k = 0x7fffffff;; k += argc;; return 0;; }; % clang++ -fsanitize=undefined test.cc; % ./a.out; test.cc:3:5: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'.

Three new parameters are available in `$ROOTSYS/etcsystem.rootrc`; ```{.cpp}; Hist.Precision.1D: float; Hist.Precision.2D: float; Hist.Precision.3D: float; ```; the default values are `float`.

Security,"/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=colz>. ## Data monitoring with JSROOT. ### Monitoring with http server. The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hprof/draw.htm?monitoring=1000>. The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed vi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:31448,access,accessed,31448,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,1,['access'],['accessed']

The final spacing is set by `SetHatchesSpacing()`; method and it is`*GetHatchesSpacing()`. - `j(0-9)` specifies the angle between 0 and 90 degres as follows:; `0=0`, `1=10`, `2=20`, `3=30`, `4=45`, `5=not drawn`, `6=60`,; `7=70`, `8=80` and `9=90`. - `k(0-9)` specifies the angle between 0 and 90 degres as follows:; `0=180`, `1=170`, `2=160`, `3=150`, `4=135`, `5=not drawn`, `6=120`,; `7=110`, `8=100` and `9=90`. ![The various patterns](pictures/030000D2.png). ### Color and Color Palettes. At initialization time, a table of basic colors is generated when the; first Canvas constructor is called. This table is a linked list, which; can be accessed from the ***`gROOT`*** object (see; `TROOT::GetListOfColors()`). Each color has an index and when a basic; color is defined, two ""companion"" colors are defined: the dark version and the bright version.; Two static functions are available that return the bright or dark color number corresponding; to a given color index. If these variants don't already exist, they are created as needed:; ```; Int_t dark = TColor::GetColorDark(color_index);; Int_t bright = TColor::GetColorBright(color_index);; ```. The dark and bright colors are used to give 3-D effects when drawing; various boxes (see **`TWbox`**, **`TPave`**, **`TPaveText`**,; **`TPaveLabel`**, etc). If you have a black and white copy of the; manual, here are the basic colors and their indices. ![The basic ROOT colors](pictures/030000D3.png). ![](pictures/image212.jpg).

So we still have all of the same data, we just organize it more efficiently for; debugger lookup. If we repeat the same ""``printf``"" lookup from above, we; would hash ""``printf``"" and find it matches ``BUCKETS[3]`` by taking the 32 bit; hash value and modulo it by ``n_buckets``. ``BUCKETS[3]`` contains ""6"" which; is the index into the ``HASHES`` table. We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``. We do this by verifying that each subsequent hash value modulo; ``n_buckets`` is still 3. In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible. The string hash that is used for these lookup tables is the Daniel J.; Bernstein hash which is also used in the ELF ``GNU_HASH`` sections. It is a; very good hash for all kinds of names in programs with very few hash; collisions. Empty buckets are designated by using an invalid hash index of ``UINT32_MAX``. Details; ^^^^^^^. These name hash tables are designed to be generic where specializations of the; table get to define additional data that goes into the header (""``HeaderData``""),; how the string value is stored (""``KeyType``"") and the content of the data for each; hash value.

Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.store``' intrinsics is designed for conditional writing of selected vector elements in a single IR operation.

The '``llvm.memset.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsic is a specialization of the; '``llvm.memset.*``' intrinsic. It differs in that the ``dest`` is treated as an array; with elements that are exactly ``element_size`` bytes, and the assignment to that array; uses uses a sequence of :ref:`unordered atomic <ordering>` store operations; that are a positive integer multiple of the ``element_size`` in size. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first three arguments are the same as they are in the :ref:`@llvm.memset <int_memset>`; intrinsic, with the added constraint that ``len`` is required to be a positive integer; multiple of the ``element_size``. If ``len`` is not a positive integer multiple of; ``element_size``, then the behaviour of the intrinsic is undefined. ``element_size`` must be a compile-time constant positive power of two no greater than; target-specific atomic access size limit. The ``dest`` input pointer must have the ``align`` parameter attribute specified. It; must be a power of two no less than the ``element_size``. Caller guarantees that; the destination pointer is aligned to that boundary. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.memset.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsic sets the ``len`` bytes of; memory starting at the destination location to the given ``value``. The memory is; set with a sequence of store operations where each access is guaranteed to be a; multiple of ``element_size`` bytes wide and aligned at an ``element_size`` boundary. The order of the assignment is unspecified. Only one write is issued to the; destination buffer per element. It is well defined to have concurrent reads and; writes to the destination provided those reads and writes are unordered atomic; when specified.

Composite shapes can be subsequently used for defining volumes.; Moreover, these volumes contain other volumes, following the general; criteria. Volumes created based on composite shapes cannot be divided. ### Navigation Methods Performed By Shapes. Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the `manager class`; at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes; can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed.; Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation; stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes; may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible; once volumes were defined based on it. The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are; performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific; algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note; that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry.; However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; ```.

Each operand in the ``memprof`` metadata attachment describes the profiled; behavior of memory allocated by the associated allocation for a given context.; In the above example, there were 2 profiled contexts, one allocating memory; that was typically cold and one allocating memory that was typically not cold. The format of the metadata describing a context specific profile (e.g.; ``!1`` and ``!3`` above) requires a first operand that is a metadata node; describing the context, followed by a list of string metadata tags describing; the profile behavior (e.g. ``cold`` and ``notcold``) above. The metadata nodes; describing the context (e.g. ``!2`` and ``!4`` above) are unique ids; corresponding to callsites, which can be matched to associated IR calls via; :ref:`callsite metadata<md_callsite>`. In practice these ids are formed via; a hash of the callsite's debug info, and the associated call may be in a; different module. The contexts are listed in order from leaf-most call (the; allocation itself) to the outermost callsite context required for uniquely; identifying the described profile behavior (note this may not be the top of; the profiled call stack). .. _md_callsite:. '``callsite``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``callsite`` metadata is used to identify callsites involved in memory; profile contexts described in :ref:`memprof metadata<md_memprof>`.

To get the source code from the CVS; repository one needs to do:. Kerberos IV authorization:. $ setenv CVSROOT :kserver:SEAL.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/SEAL. $ cvs co MathLibs/Minuit. Anonymous read-only access (if it's enabled by the librarian, see; details):. $ setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@SEAL.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/SEAL. $ cvs login. (Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@seal.cvs.cern.ch:2401/cvs/SEAL) CVS; password:cvs. $ cvs co MathLibs/Minuit. (If you want to check out a tagged version SEAL\_x\_x\_x of MINUIT, then; do. $ cvs co -r SEAL\_x\_x\_x MathLibs/Minuit ). ## Create a tar.gz from CVS ##. Once the sources are checked out from the CVS code repository,. 1. change to the directory:. $ cd MathLibs/Minuit. 2. run autogen:. $ ./autogen. 3. create a new directory:. $ cd ..; $ mkdir Minuit-BUILD; $ cd Minuit-BUILD/. 4. run configure:. $ ../Minuit/configure. 5. create the tar.gz:. $ make dist. This will create a Minuit-x.x.x.tar.gz which can be distributed and used; as described above. ## M versions ##. The version numbers of M follow the release numbers of the SEAL project; @bib-SEAL at CERN @bib-CERN. ### From to ###. The program is entirely written in standard portable .

So we still have all of the same data, we just organize it more efficiently for; debugger lookup. If we repeat the same ""``printf``"" lookup from above, we; would hash ""``printf``"" and find it matches ``BUCKETS[3]`` by taking the 32 bit; hash value and modulo it by ``n_buckets``. ``BUCKETS[3]`` contains ""6"" which; is the index into the ``HASHES`` table. We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``. We do this by verifying that each subsequent hash value modulo; ``n_buckets`` is still 3. In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible.

Reading and writing references in the heap; ------------------------------------------. Some collectors need to be informed when the mutator (the program that needs; garbage collection) either reads a pointer from or writes a pointer to a field; of a heap object. The code fragments inserted at these points are called *read; barriers* and *write barriers*, respectively. The amount of code that needs to; be executed is usually quite small and not on the critical path of any; computation, so the overall performance impact of the barrier is tolerable. Barriers often require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n. LLVM does not enforce this relationship between the object and derived pointer; (although a particular :ref:`collector strategy <plugin>` might). However, it; would be an unusual collector that violated it. The use of these intrinsics is naturally optional if the target GC does not; require the corresponding barrier.

Which image should I choose?; ============================; We currently provide two images: Debian10-based and nvidia-cuda-based. They; differ in the base image that they use, i.e. they have a different set of; preinstalled binaries. Debian8 is very minimal, nvidia-cuda is larger, but has; preinstalled CUDA libraries and allows to access a GPU, installed on your; machine. If you need a minimal linux distribution with only clang and libstdc++ included,; you should try Debian10-based image. If you want to use CUDA libraries and have access to a GPU on your machine,; you should choose nvidia-cuda-based image and use `nvidia-docker; <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ to run your docker containers. Note; that you don't need nvidia-docker to build the images, but you need it in order; to have an access to GPU from a docker container that is running the built; image. If you have a different use-case, you could create your own image based on; ``example/`` folder. Any docker image can be built and run using only the docker binary, i.e. you can; run debian10 build on Fedora or any other Linux distribution. You don't need to; install CMake, compilers or any other clang dependencies. It is all handled; during the build process inside Docker's isolated environment.

ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext are wrappers around Modules and; LLVMContexts respectively. A ThreadSafeModule is a pair of a; std::unique_ptr<Module> and a (possibly shared) ThreadSafeContext value. A; ThreadSafeContext is a pair of a std::unique_ptr<LLVMContext> and a lock.; This design serves two purposes: providing a locking scheme and lifetime; management for LLVMContexts. The ThreadSafeContext may be locked to prevent; accidental concurrent access by two Modules that use the same LLVMContext.; The underlying LLVMContext is freed once all ThreadSafeContext values pointing; to it are destroyed, allowing the context memory to be reclaimed as soon as; the Modules referring to it are destroyed. ThreadSafeContexts can be explicitly constructed from a; std::unique_ptr<LLVMContext>:. .. code-block:: c++. ThreadSafeContext TSCtx(std::make_unique<LLVMContext>());.

Security,"::vector<std::string>``. The rest of this section shows examples of how STL containers can be used in; a natural, pythonistic, way. `std::vector`; -------------. A ``std::vector`` is the most commonly used C++ container type because it is; more efficient and performant than specialized types such as ``list`` and; ``map``, unless the number of elements gets very large.; Python has several similar types, from the builtin ``tuple`` and ``list``,; the ``array`` from builtin module ``array``, to ""as-good-as-builtin""; ``numpy.ndarray``.; A vector is more like the latter two in that it can contain only one type,; but more like the former two in that it can contain objects.; In practice, it can interplay well with all these containers, but e.g.; efficiency and performance can differ significantly. A vector can be instantiated from any sequence, including generators, and; vectors of objects can be recursively constructed.; If the template type is to be inferred from the argument to the constructor,; the first element needs to be accessible, which precludes generators. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl.std import vector, pair; >>> v = vector[int](range(10)) # from generator; >>> len(v); 10; >>> v = vector([x for x in range(10)]) # type inferred; >>> type(v); <class cppyy.gbl.std.vector<int> at 0x12d226f00>; >>> len(v); 10; >>> vp = vector[pair[int, int]](((1, 2), (3, 4))); >>> len(vp); 2; >>> vp[1][0]; 3; >>>. To extend a vector in-place with another sequence object, use ``+=``, just as; for Python's ``list``:. .. code-block:: python. >>> v += range(10, 20); >>> len(v); 20; >>>.

Every edge will have its own `guard_variable` (uint32_t).

Security,"; --------------------. The ``alias`` method is the primary interface used to determine whether or not; two memory objects alias each other. It takes two memory objects as input and; returns MustAlias, PartialAlias, MayAlias, or NoAlias as appropriate. Like all ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces, the ``alias`` method requires that either; the two pointer values be defined within the same function, or at least one of; the values is a :ref:`constant <constants>`. .. _Must, May, or No:. Must, May, and No Alias Responses; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``NoAlias`` response may be used when there is never an immediate dependence; between any memory reference *based* on one pointer and any memory reference; *based* the other. The most obvious example is when the two pointers point to; non-overlapping memory ranges. Another is when the two pointers are only ever; used for reading memory. Another is when the memory is freed and reallocated; between accesses through one pointer and accesses through the other --- in this; case, there is a dependence, but it's mediated by the free and reallocation. As an exception to this is with the :ref:`noalias <noalias>` keyword;; the ""irrelevant"" dependencies are ignored. The ``MayAlias`` response is used whenever the two pointers might refer to the; same object. The ``PartialAlias`` response is used when the two memory objects are known to; be overlapping in some way, regardless whether they start at the same address; or not. The ``MustAlias`` response may only be returned if the two memory objects are; guaranteed to always start at exactly the same location. A ``MustAlias``; response does not imply that the pointers compare equal. The ``getModRefInfo`` methods; -----------------------------.

The matrix elements can be set using the `operator()(irow,icol)`, where; `irow` and `icol` are the row and column indexes or by using the; iterator interface. Notice that the indexes start from zero and not from; one as in FORTRAN. Furthermore, all the matrix elements can be set also; by using the SetElements function passing a generic iterator. The; elements can be accessed by the same methods as well as by using the; function `ROOT::Math::SMatrix::apply`. The `apply(i)` has exactly the; same behavior for general and symmetric matrices; in contrast to the; iterator access methods which behave differently (it follows the data; order). ``` {.cpp}; SMatrix33 m;; m(0,0) = 1; // set the element in first row and first column; *(m.begin()+1) = 2; // set the second element (0,1); double d[9]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};; m.SetElements(d,d+9); // set the d[] values in m; double x = m(2,1); // return the element in 3; x = m.apply(7); // return the 8-th element (row=2,col=1); x = *(m.begin()+7); // return the 8-th element (row=2,col=1); // symmetric matrices; //(note the difference in behavior between apply and the iterators); x = *(m.begin()+4) // return the element (row=2,col=1); x = m.apply(7); // returns again the (row=2,col=1) element; ```. There are methods to place and/or retrieve **`ROOT::Math::SVector`**; objects as rows or columns in (from) a matrix.

However, this can be mitigated by hardening the load of the return address just; like any other load. This is sometimes complicated because x86 for example; *implicitly* loads the return address off the stack. However, the; implementation technique below is specifically designed to mitigate this; implicit load by using the stack pointer to communicate misspeculation between; functions.

Security,"; ======================; Thread Safety Analysis; ======================. Introduction; ============. Clang Thread Safety Analysis is a C++ language extension which warns about; potential race conditions in code. The analysis is completely static (i.e.; compile-time); there is no run-time overhead. The analysis is still; under active development, but it is mature enough to be deployed in an; industrial setting. It is being developed by Google, in collaboration with; CERT/SEI, and is used extensively in Google's internal code base. Thread safety analysis works very much like a type system for multi-threaded; programs. In addition to declaring the *type* of data (e.g. ``int``, ``float``,; etc.), the programmer can (optionally) declare how access to that data is; controlled in a multi-threaded environment. For example, if ``foo`` is; *guarded by* the mutex ``mu``, then the analysis will issue a warning whenever; a piece of code reads or writes to ``foo`` without first locking ``mu``.; Similarly, if there are particular routines that should only be called by; the GUI thread, then the analysis will warn if other threads call those; routines. Getting Started; ----------------. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""mutex.h"". class BankAccount {; private:; Mutex mu;; int balance GUARDED_BY(mu);. void depositImpl(int amount) {; balance += amount; // WARNING! Cannot write balance without locking mu.; }. void withdrawImpl(int amount) REQUIRES(mu) {; balance -= amount; // OK. Caller must have locked mu.; }. public:; void withdraw(int amount) {; mu.Lock();; withdrawImpl(amount); // OK. We've locked mu.; } // WARNING!

Two non-generic instructions: (BPF_ABS | <size> | BPF_LD) and; (BPF_IND | <size> | BPF_LD) which are used to access packet data.; Register R6 is an implicit input that must contain pointer to sk_buff.; Register R0 is an implicit output which contains the data fetched; from the packet. Registers R1-R5 are scratch registers and must not; be used to store the data across BPF_ABS | BPF_LD or BPF_IND | BPF_LD; instructions. These instructions have implicit program exit condition; as well. When eBPF program is trying to access the data beyond; the packet boundary, the interpreter will abort the execution of the program.

Function calls; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Function call arguments are passed using up to five registers (R1 - R5).; The return value is passed in a dedicated register (R0). Four additional; registers (R6 - R9) are callee-saved, and the values in these registers; are preserved within kernel functions. R0 - R5 are scratch registers within; kernel functions, and eBPF programs must therefor store/restore values in; these registers if needed across function calls. The stack can be accessed; using the read-only frame pointer R10. eBPF registers map 1:1 to hardware; registers on x86_64 and other 64-bit architectures.

Still some work and; polish has to be done but the reference guide in this new format is now online; and can be seen from the [ROOT home page](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html). ## Core Libraries. ### Dictionary generation. Fixed the dictionary generation in the case of class inside a namespace; marked inlined. Added mechanisms to stop the dictionary generation while parsing the XML and while selecting in presence of duplicates. Fix [ROOT-7760] : fully allow the usage of the dylib extension on OSx. Fix [ROOT-7723] : allow IOCtors to have as argument a ref to a type called __void__. We added a dictionary for map<string,string> as part of the default STL dictionary. We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ### Thread safety and thread awareness. We added the function `TMethodCall::GetCallFunc` to allow direct access to the function wrapper. We reduced thread serialization in `TClass::GetCheckSum`, `TClass::GetBaseClassOffset` and `TClass::Property`. `TObjArray::Delete` was updated to allow its caller to explicitly avoid costly checks (extra RecursiveRemove and lock). We removed the need to create a TThread object per thread in a multi-threaded application. Now ROOT can be used with any threading model (e.g. OpenMP, STL threads, TBB) transparently. All the internal synchronisation mechanisms of ROOT are activated by a single call: `ROOT::EnableThreadSafety()` which is the successor of the existing `TThread::Initialize`. This call must take place if ROOT needs to be used in a thread safe manner. The implementation of TSemaphore was redone based on C++11 thread primitive in order to prevent cases where some of request post were lost. ### TDirectory::TContext.

This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already.

The *static subobjects* of a type ``T`` at a location ``L`` are:. - an object of type ``T`` spanning from ``L`` to ``L + sizeof(T)``;. - if ``T`` is a struct type, then for each field ``f`` of that struct,; the static subobjects of ``T`` at location ``L + offsetof(T, .f)``; and. - if ``T`` is the array type ``E[N]``, then for each ``i`` satisfying; ``0 <= i < N``, the static subobjects of ``E`` at location; ``L + i * sizeof(E)``. If an l-value is converted to an r-value, then all static subobjects; whose types are non-trivial to copy are accessed. If an l-value is; assigned to, or if an object of automatic storage duration goes out of; scope, then all static subobjects of types that are non-trivial to destroy; are accessed.

RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation), but to; fully use vector extensions of modern CPUs, a manual compilation of ROOT was necessary, setting the required compiler flags. Now, RooFit comes with dedicated computation libraries, each compiled for a specific CPU architecture. When RooFit is loaded for the; first time, ROOT inspects the CPU capabilities, and loads the fastest supported version of this computation library.; This means that RooFit can now use vector extensions such as AVX2 without being recompiled, which enables a speed up of up to 4x for certain computations.; Combined with better data access patterns (~3x speed up, ROOT 6.20), computations with optimised PDFs speed up between 4x and 16x. The fast `BatchMode` now also works in combination with multi processing (`NumCPU`) and with binned data (`RooDataHist`). See [Demo notebook in SWAN](https://github.com/hageboeck/rootNotebooks),; [EPJ Web Conf. 245 (2020) 06007](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2020/21/epjconf_chep2020_06007/epjconf_chep2020_06007.html),; [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). #### RooBatchCompute Library. The library that contains the optimised computation functions is called `RooBatchCompute`. The PDFs contained in this library are highly optimized, and there is currently work in progress for further optimization using CUDA and multi-threaded computations.

Note that ``getelementptr`` with all-zero indices is always considered to be; ``inbounds``, even if the base pointer does not point to an allocated object.; As a corollary, the only pointer in bounds of the null pointer in the default; address space is the null pointer itself. These rules are based on the assumption that no allocated object may cross; the unsigned address space boundary, and no allocated object may be larger; than half the pointer index type space. If the ``inrange`` keyword is present before any index, loading from or; storing to any pointer derived from the ``getelementptr`` has undefined; behavior if the load or store would access memory outside of the bounds of; the element selected by the index marked as ``inrange``. The result of a; pointer comparison or ``ptrtoint`` (including ``ptrtoint``-like operations; involving memory) involving a pointer derived from a ``getelementptr`` with; the ``inrange`` keyword is undefined, with the exception of comparisons; in the case where both operands are in the range of the element selected; by the ``inrange`` keyword, inclusive of the address one past the end of; that element.

Internal vs External Storage; ----------------------------. By default, all command line options automatically hold the value that they; parse from the command line. This is very convenient in the common case,; especially when combined with the ability to define command line options in the; files that use them. This is called the internal storage model. Sometimes, however, it is nice to separate the command line option processing; code from the storage of the value parsed. For example, lets say that we have a; '``-debug``' option that we would like to use to enable debug information across; the entire body of our program. In this case, the boolean value controlling the; debug code should be globally accessible (in a header file, for example) yet the; command line option processing code should not be exposed to all of these; clients (requiring lots of .cpp files to ``#include CommandLine.h``). To do this, set up your .h file with your option, like this for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // DebugFlag.h - Get access to the '-debug' command line option; //. // DebugFlag - This boolean is set to true if the '-debug' command line option; // is specified. This should probably not be referenced directly, instead, use; // the DEBUG macro below.; //; extern bool DebugFlag;. // DEBUG macro - This macro should be used by code to emit debug information.; // In the '-debug' option is specified on the command line, and if this is a; // debug build, then the code specified as the option to the macro will be; // executed. Otherwise it will not be.; #ifdef NDEBUG; #define LLVM_DEBUG(X); #else; #define LLVM_DEBUG(X) do { if (DebugFlag) { X; } } while (0); #endif.

The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths.

Now we can add the friends to the first chain. ``` {.cpp}; ch.AddFriend(""t1"");; ch.AddFriend(""t2"");; ch.AddFriend(""t3"");; ```. The parameter is the name of friend chain (the name of a chain is always; the name of the tree from which it was created). The original chain has; access to all variables in its friends. We can use the `TChain::Draw`; method as if the values in the friends were in the original chain. To; specify the chain to use in the `Draw` method, use:. ``` {.cpp}; <chainname>.<branchname>.<varname>; ```. If the variable name is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you; can leave out the chain and/or branch name.

However, some virtual; addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible by the GPU,; and some by both. Using the constant memory space indicates that the data will not change during; the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to be; used. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated of volatile data before; each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant memory to change values between; kernel dispatches.

A *linkage unit* is a set of; translation units linked together into an executable or DSO, and a linkage; unit's *LTO unit* is the subset of the linkage unit that is linked together; using link-time optimization; in the case where LTO is not being used, the; linkage unit's LTO unit is empty. Each linkage unit has only a single LTO unit. The LTO visibility of a class is used by the compiler to determine which; classes the whole-program devirtualization (``-fwhole-program-vtables``) and; control flow integrity (``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall`` and ``-fsanitize=cfi-mfcall``); features apply to. These features use whole-program information, so they; require the entire class hierarchy to be visible in order to work correctly. If any translation unit in the program uses either of the whole-program; devirtualization or control flow integrity features, it is effectively an ODR; violation to define a class with hidden LTO visibility in multiple linkage; units. A class with public LTO visibility may be defined in multiple linkage; units, but the tradeoff is that the whole-program devirtualization and; control flow integrity features can only be applied to classes with hidden LTO; visibility. A class's LTO visibility is treated as an ODR-relevant property; of its definition, so it must be consistent between translation units. In translation units built with LTO, LTO visibility is based on the; class's symbol visibility as expressed at the source level (i.e. the; ``__attribute__((visibility(""..."")))`` attribute, or the ``-fvisibility=``; flag) or, on the Windows platform, the dllimport and dllexport attributes.

Security,"=======. Debugging Information Extension for Objective C Properties; ----------------------------------------------------------. Introduction; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Objective C provides a simpler way to declare and define accessor methods using; declared properties. The language provides features to declare a property and; to let compiler synthesize accessor methods. The debugger lets developer inspect Objective C interfaces and their instance; variables and class variables. However, the debugger does not know anything; about the properties defined in Objective C interfaces. The debugger consumes; information generated by compiler in DWARF format. The format does not support; encoding of Objective C properties. This proposal describes DWARF extensions to; encode Objective C properties, which the debugger can use to let developers; inspect Objective C properties. Proposal; ^^^^^^^^. Objective C properties exist separately from class members. A property can be; defined only by ""setter"" and ""getter"" selectors, and be calculated anew on each; access. Or a property can just be a direct access to some declared ivar.; Finally it can have an ivar ""automatically synthesized"" for it by the compiler,; in which case the property can be referred to in user code directly using the; standard C dereference syntax as well as through the property ""dot"" syntax, but; there is no entry in the ``@interface`` declaration corresponding to this ivar. To facilitate debugging, these properties we will add a new DWARF TAG into the; ``DW_TAG_structure_type`` definition for the class to hold the description of a; given property, and a set of DWARF attributes that provide said description.; The property tag will also contain the name and declared type of the property. If there is a related ivar, there will also be a DWARF property attribute placed; in the ``DW_TAG_member`` DIE for that ivar referring back to the property TAG; for that property.

Security,"=======; Modules; =======. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============; Most software is built using a number of software libraries, including libraries supplied by the platform, internal libraries built as part of the software itself to provide structure, and third-party libraries. For each library, one needs to access both its interface (API) and its implementation. In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):. .. code-block:: c. #include <SomeLib.h>. The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker. Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library. Problems with the current model; -------------------------------; The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:. * **Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the; compiler must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every; header it includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion.

Security,"=========; SafeStack; =========. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. SafeStack is an instrumentation pass that protects programs against attacks; based on stack buffer overflows, without introducing any measurable performance; overhead. It works by separating the program stack into two distinct regions:; the safe stack and the unsafe stack. The safe stack stores return addresses,; register spills, and local variables that are always accessed in a safe way,; while the unsafe stack stores everything else. This separation ensures that; buffer overflows on the unsafe stack cannot be used to overwrite anything; on the safe stack. SafeStack is a part of the `Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) Project; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/>`_. Performance; -----------. The performance overhead of the SafeStack instrumentation is less than 0.1% on; average across a variety of benchmarks (see the `Code-Pointer Integrity; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf>`__ paper for details). This is mainly; because most small functions do not have any variables that require the unsafe; stack and, hence, do not need unsafe stack frames to be created. The cost of; creating unsafe stack frames for large functions is amortized by the cost of; executing the function. In some cases, SafeStack actually improves the performance. Objects that end up; being moved to the unsafe stack are usually large arrays or variables that are; used through multiple stack frames. Moving such objects away from the safe; stack increases the locality of frequently accessed values on the stack, such; as register spills, return addresses, and small local variables. Compatibility; -------------. Most programs, static libraries, or individual files can be compiled; with SafeStack as is. SafeStack requires basic runtime support, which, on most; platforms, is implemented as a compiler-rt library that is automatically linked; in when the program is compiled with SafeStack.

Security,"=============; Type Metadata; =============. Type metadata is a mechanism that allows IR modules to co-operatively build; pointer sets corresponding to addresses within a given set of globals. LLVM's; `control flow integrity`_ implementation uses this metadata to efficiently; check (at each call site) that a given address corresponds to either a; valid vtable or function pointer for a given class or function type, and its; whole-program devirtualization pass uses the metadata to identify potential; callees for a given virtual call. To use the mechanism, a client creates metadata nodes with two elements:. 1. a byte offset into the global (generally zero for functions); 2. a metadata object representing an identifier for the type. These metadata nodes are associated with globals by using global object; metadata attachments with the ``!type`` metadata kind. Each type identifier must exclusively identify either global variables; or functions. .. admonition:: Limitation. The current implementation only supports attaching metadata to functions on; the x86-32 and x86-64 architectures. An intrinsic, :ref:`llvm.type.test <type.test>`, is used to test whether a; given pointer is associated with a type identifier. .. _control flow integrity: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html.

Security,"==============; LTO Visibility; ==============. *LTO visibility* is a property of an entity that specifies whether it can be; referenced from outside the current LTO unit. A *linkage unit* is a set of; translation units linked together into an executable or DSO, and a linkage; unit's *LTO unit* is the subset of the linkage unit that is linked together; using link-time optimization; in the case where LTO is not being used, the; linkage unit's LTO unit is empty. Each linkage unit has only a single LTO unit. The LTO visibility of a class is used by the compiler to determine which; classes the whole-program devirtualization (``-fwhole-program-vtables``) and; control flow integrity (``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall`` and ``-fsanitize=cfi-mfcall``); features apply to. These features use whole-program information, so they; require the entire class hierarchy to be visible in order to work correctly. If any translation unit in the program uses either of the whole-program; devirtualization or control flow integrity features, it is effectively an ODR; violation to define a class with hidden LTO visibility in multiple linkage; units. A class with public LTO visibility may be defined in multiple linkage; units, but the tradeoff is that the whole-program devirtualization and; control flow integrity features can only be applied to classes with hidden LTO; visibility. A class's LTO visibility is treated as an ODR-relevant property; of its definition, so it must be consistent between translation units. In translation units built with LTO, LTO visibility is based on the; class's symbol visibility as expressed at the source level (i.e. the; ``__attribute__((visibility(""..."")))`` attribute, or the ``-fvisibility=``; flag) or, on the Windows platform, the dllimport and dllexport attributes. When; targeting non-Windows platforms, classes with a visibility other than hidden; visibility receive public LTO visibility.

The sanitizers support a simple mechanism for gathering profiling statistics; to help understand the overhead associated with sanitizers. How to build and run; ====================. SanitizerStats can currently only be used with :doc:`ControlFlowIntegrity`.; In addition to ``-fsanitize=cfi*``, pass the ``-fsanitize-stats`` flag.; This will cause the program to count the number of times that each control; flow integrity check in the program fires. At run time, set the ``SANITIZER_STATS_PATH`` environment variable to direct; statistics output to a file. The file will be written on process exit.; The following substitutions will be applied to the environment variable:. - ``%b`` -- The executable basename.; - ``%p`` -- The process ID. You can also send the ``SIGUSR2`` signal to a process to make it write; sanitizer statistics immediately. The ``sanstats`` program can be used to dump statistics. It takes as a; command line argument the path to a statistics file produced by a program; compiled with ``-fsanitize-stats``. The output of ``sanstats`` is in four columns, separated by spaces. The first; column is the file and line number of the call site. The second column is; the function name.

Security,"===============; ShadowCallStack; ===============. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. ShadowCallStack is an instrumentation pass, currently only implemented for; aarch64, that protects programs against return address overwrites; (e.g. stack buffer overflows.) It works by saving a function's return address; to a separately allocated 'shadow call stack' in the function prolog in; non-leaf functions and loading the return address from the shadow call stack; in the function epilog. The return address is also stored on the regular stack; for compatibility with unwinders, but is otherwise unused. The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and; an `implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc; (bionic). An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found; to have critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in; LLVM 9.0. Details on the x86_64 implementation can be found in the; `Clang 7.0.1 documentation`_. .. _`implementation of the runtime`: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/808d176e7e0dd727c7f929622ec017f6e065c582/libc/bionic/pthread_create.cpp#128; .. _`Clang 7.0.1 documentation`: https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.html. Comparison; ----------. To optimize for memory consumption and cache locality, the shadow call; stack stores only an array of return addresses. This is in contrast to other; schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off; consuming more memory for shorter function prologs and epilogs with fewer; memory accesses. `Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks; on x86_64.

Allow LLVM contributors and security researchers to disclose security-related issues affecting the LLVM project to members of the LLVM community.; 2. Organize fixes, code reviews, and release management for said issues.; 3. Allow distributors time to investigate and deploy fixes before wide dissemination of vulnerabilities or mitigation shortcomings.; 4. Ensure timely notification and release to vendors who package and distribute LLVM-based toolchains and projects.; 5. Ensure timely notification to users of LLVM-based toolchains whose compiled code is security-sensitive, through the `CVE process`_.; 6. Strive to improve security over time, for example by adding additional testing, fuzzing, and hardening after fixing issues. *Note*: these goals ensure timely action, provide disclosure timing when issues are reported, and respect vendors' / packagers' / users' constraints. The LLVM Security Group is private. It is composed of trusted LLVM contributors.

The full YAML language; spec can be read at `yaml.org; <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction>`_. The simplest form of; yaml is just ""scalars"", ""mappings"", and ""sequences"". A scalar is any number; or string. The pound/hash symbol (#) begins a comment line. A mapping is; a set of key-value pairs where the key ends with a colon. For example:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a mapping; name: Tom; hat-size: 7. A sequence is a list of items where each item starts with a leading dash ('-').; For example:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence; - x86; - x86_64; - PowerPC. You can combine mappings and sequences by indenting. For example a sequence; of mappings in which one of the mapping values is itself a sequence:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence of mappings with one key's value being a sequence; - name: Tom; cpus:; - x86; - x86_64; - name: Bob; cpus:; - x86; - name: Dan; cpus:; - PowerPC; - x86. Sometime sequences are known to be short and the one entry per line is too; verbose, so YAML offers an alternate syntax for sequences called a ""Flow; Sequence"" in which you put comma separated sequence elements into square; brackets. The above example could then be simplified to :. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence of mappings with one key's value being a flow sequence; - name: Tom; cpus: [ x86, x86_64 ]; - name: Bob; cpus: [ x86 ]; - name: Dan; cpus: [ PowerPC, x86 ].

Clang includes an implementation of a number of control flow integrity (CFI); schemes, which are designed to abort the program upon detecting certain forms; of undefined behavior that can potentially allow attackers to subvert the; program's control flow. These schemes have been optimized for performance,; allowing developers to enable them in release builds. To enable Clang's available CFI schemes, use the flag ``-fsanitize=cfi``.; You can also enable a subset of available :ref:`schemes <cfi-schemes>`.; As currently implemented, all schemes rely on link-time optimization (LTO);; so it is required to specify ``-flto``, and the linker used must support LTO,; for example via the `gold plugin`_. To allow the checks to be implemented efficiently, the program must; be structured such that certain object files are compiled with CFI; enabled, and are statically linked into the program. This may preclude; the use of shared libraries in some cases. The compiler will only produce CFI checks for a class if it can infer hidden; LTO visibility for that class. LTO visibility is a property of a class that; is inferred from flags and attributes. For more details, see the documentation; for :doc:`LTO visibility <LTOVisibility>`. The ``-fsanitize=cfi-{vcall,nvcall,derived-cast,unrelated-cast}`` flags; require that a ``-fvisibility=`` flag also be specified. This is because the; default visibility setting is ``-fvisibility=default``, which would disable; CFI checks for classes without visibility attributes. Most users will want; to specify ``-fvisibility=hidden``, which enables CFI checks for such classes. Experimental support for :ref:`cross-DSO control flow integrity; <cfi-cross-dso>` exists that does not require classes to have hidden LTO; visibility.

Security,"======================; Matching the Clang AST; ======================. This document explains how to use Clang's LibASTMatchers to match interesting; nodes of the AST and execute code that uses the matched nodes. Combined with; :doc:`LibTooling`, LibASTMatchers helps to write code-to-code transformation; tools or query tools. We assume basic knowledge about the Clang AST. See the :doc:`Introduction; to the Clang AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>` if you want to learn more; about how the AST is structured. .. FIXME: create tutorial and link to the tutorial. Introduction; ------------. LibASTMatchers provides a domain specific language to create predicates on; Clang's AST. This DSL is written in and can be used from C++, allowing users; to write a single program to both match AST nodes and access the node's C++; interface to extract attributes, source locations, or any other information; provided on the AST level. AST matchers are predicates on nodes in the AST. Matchers are created by; calling creator functions that allow building up a tree of matchers, where; inner matchers are used to make the match more specific. For example, to create a matcher that matches all class or union declarations; in the AST of a translation unit, you can call `recordDecl(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#recordDecl0Anchor>`_. To narrow the match down,; for example to find all class or union declarations with the name ""``Foo``"",; insert a `hasName <LibASTMatchersReference.html#hasName0Anchor>`_ matcher: the; call ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""))`` returns a matcher that matches classes or; unions that are named ""``Foo``"", in any namespace. By default, matchers that; accept multiple inner matchers use an implicit `allOf(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#allOf0Anchor>`_. This allows further narrowing; down the match, for example to match all classes that are derived from; ""``Bar``"": ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""), isDerivedFrom(""Bar""))``.

The Clang driver is intended to be a production quality compiler driver; providing access to the Clang compiler and tools, with a command line; interface which is compatible with the gcc driver.

As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------.

This document explains how to use clang's source-based code coverage feature.; It's called ""source-based"" because it operates on AST and preprocessor; information directly. This allows it to generate very precise coverage data. Clang ships two other code coverage implementations:. * :doc:`SanitizerCoverage` - A low-overhead tool meant for use alongside the; various sanitizers. It can provide up to edge-level coverage. * gcov - A GCC-compatible coverage implementation which operates on DebugInfo.; This is enabled by ``-ftest-coverage`` or ``--coverage``. From this point onwards ""code coverage"" will refer to the source-based kind. The code coverage workflow; ==========================. The code coverage workflow consists of three main steps:. * Compiling with coverage enabled. * Running the instrumented program. * Creating coverage reports. The next few sections work through a complete, copy-'n-paste friendly example; based on this program:. .. code-block:: cpp. % cat <<EOF > foo.cc; #define BAR(x) ((x) || (x)); template <typename T> void foo(T x) {; for (unsigned I = 0; I < 10; ++I) { BAR(I); }; }; int main() {; foo<int>(0);; foo<float>(0);; return 0;; }; EOF.

Security,"==========================; Symbolizer Markup Format; ==========================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. This document defines a text format for log messages that can be processed by a; symbolizing filter. The basic idea is that logging code emits text that contains; raw address values and so forth, without the logging code doing any real work to; convert those values to human-readable form. Instead, logging text uses the; markup format defined here to identify pieces of information that should be; converted to human-readable form after the fact. As with other markup formats,; the expectation is that most of the text will be displayed as is, while the; markup elements will be replaced with expanded text, or converted into active UI; elements, that present more details in symbolic form. This means there is no need for symbol tables, DWARF debugging sections, or; similar information to be directly accessible at runtime. There is also no need; at runtime for any logic intended to compute human-readable presentation of; information, such as C++ symbol demangling. Instead, logging must include markup; elements that give the contextual information necessary to make sense of the raw; data, such as memory layout details. This format identifies markup elements with a syntax that is both simple and; distinctive. It's simple enough to be matched and parsed with straightforward; code. It's distinctive enough that character sequences that look like the start; or end of a markup element should rarely if ever appear incidentally in logging; text. It's specifically intended not to require sanitizing plain text, such as; the HTML/XML requirement to replace ``<`` with ``&lt;`` and the like. :doc:`llvm-symbolizer <CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer>` includes a symbolizing; filter via its ``--filter-markup`` option.

There is a core part of it that encompass the implementation of the compiler; (front/middle/back ends), run-time libraries (RT, C++, OpenMP, etc) and; associated tools (debugger, linker, object file manipulation, etc). These; components are present in the public release on our supported architectures; and operating systems and the whole community must maintain and care about. There are, however, other components within the main repository that either; cater to a specific sub-community of LLVM (upstream or downstream) or; help parts of the community to integrate LLVM into their own development tools; or external projects. Those parts of the main repository don't always have; rigorous testing like the core parts, nor are they validated and shipped with; our public upstream releases. Even not being a core part of the project, we have enough sub-communities; needing those changes with enough overlap that having them in the main; repository is beneficial to minimise the repetition of those changes in all; the external repositories that need them. But the maintenance costs of such diverse ecosystem is non trivial, so we divide; the level of support in two tiers: core and peripheral, with two; different levels of impact and responsibilities.

What This Proposal is *Not* About; =================================. Changing the development policy. This proposal relates only to moving the hosting of our source-code repository; from SVN hosted on our own servers to Git hosted on GitHub. We are not proposing; using GitHub's issue tracker, pull-requests, or code-review. Contributors will continue to earn commit access on demand under the Developer; Policy, except that that a GitHub account will be required instead of SVN; username/password-hash. Why Git, and Why GitHub?; ========================. Why Move At All?; ----------------. This discussion began because we currently host our own Subversion server; and Git mirror on a voluntary basis. The LLVM Foundation sponsors the server and; provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do. Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, cod",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst:656,validat,validation,656,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,1,['validat'],['validation']
Security,"================================; How to submit an LLVM bug report; ================================. Introduction - Got bugs?; ========================. If you're working with LLVM and run into a bug, we definitely want to know; about it. This document describes what you can do to increase the odds of; getting it fixed quickly. 🔒 If you believe that the bug is security related, please follow :ref:`report-security-issue`. 🔒. Basically you have to do two things at a minimum. First, decide whether the; bug `crashes the compiler`_ or if the compiler is `miscompiling`_ the program; (i.e., the compiler successfully produces an executable, but it doesn't run; right). Based on what type of bug it is, follow the instructions in the; linked section to narrow down the bug so that the person who fixes it will be; able to find the problem more easily. Once you have a reduced test-case, go to `the LLVM Bug Tracking System; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_ and fill out the form with the; necessary details (note that you don't need to pick a label, just use if you're; not sure). The bug description should contain the following information:. * All information necessary to reproduce the problem.; * The reduced test-case that triggers the bug.; * The location where you obtained LLVM (if not from our Git; repository). Thanks for helping us make LLVM better!. .. _crashes the compiler:. Crashing Bugs; =============. More often than not, bugs in the compiler cause it to crash---often due to; an assertion failure of some sort. The most important piece of the puzzle; is to figure out if it is crashing in the Clang front-end or if it is one of; the LLVM libraries (e.g. the optimizer or code generator) that has; problems. To figure out which component is crashing (the front-end, middle-end; optimizer, or backend code generator), run the ``clang`` command line as you; were when the crash occurred, but with the following extra command line; options:. * ``-emit-llvm -Xclang -disab",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSubmitABug.rst:364,secur,security,364,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSubmitABug.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSubmitABug.rst,2,['secur'],"['security', 'security-issue']"
Security,"==================================; Stack Safety Analysis; ==================================. Introduction; ============. The Stack Safety Analysis determines if stack allocated variables can be; considered 'safe' from memory access bugs. The primary purpose of the analysis is to be used by sanitizers to avoid; unnecessary instrumentation of 'safe' variables. SafeStack is going to be the; first user. 'safe' variables can be defined as variables that can not be used out-of-scope; (e.g. use-after-return) or accessed out of bounds. In the future it can be; extended to track other variable properties. E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool. AddressSanitizer may help with this validation.

This document aims to provide a high-level overview of the design and API; of the JITLink library.

If you know; what a section, symbol, and relocation are you should find this document; accessible. If it is not, please submit a patch (:doc:`Contributing`) or file a; bug (:doc:`HowToSubmitABug`). JITLink is a library for :ref:`jit_linking`. It was built to support the :doc:`ORC JIT; APIs<ORCv2>` and is most commonly accessed via ORC's ObjectLinkingLayer API. JITLink was; developed with the aim of supporting the full set of features provided by each; object format; including static initializers, exception handling, thread local; variables, and language runtime registration. Supporting these features enables; ORC to execute code generated from source languages which rely on these features; (e.g. C++ requires object format support for static initializers to support; static constructors, eh-frame registration for exceptions, and TLV support for; thread locals; Swift and Objective-C require language runtime registration for; many features). For some object format features support is provided entirely; within JITLink, and for others it is provided in cooperation with the; (prototype) ORC runtime. JITLink aims to support the following features, some of which are still under; development:. 1. Cross-process and cross-architecture linking of single relocatable objects; into a target *executor* process. 2. Support for all object format features. 3. Open linker data structures (``LinkGraph``) and pass system. JITLink and ObjectLinkingLayer; ==============================. ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` is ORCs wrapper for JITLink.

This document provides an overview of an external tool to verify the protection; mechanisms implemented by Clang's *Control Flow Integrity* (CFI) schemes; (``-fsanitize=cfi``). This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form. This tool should also be added as part of Clang's continuous integration testing; framework, where modifications to the compiler ensure that CFI protection; schemes are still present in the final binary. Location; ========. This tool will be present as a part of the LLVM toolchain, and will reside in; the ""/llvm/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"" directory, relative to the LLVM trunk. It will; be tested in two methods:. - Unit tests to validate code sections, present in; ""/llvm/unittests/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"".; - Integration tests, present in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"".

Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review.

Security,"==================================================; ``-fbounds-safety``: Enforcing bounds safety for C; ==================================================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. ``-fbounds-safety`` is a C extension to enforce bounds safety to prevent; out-of-bounds (OOB) memory accesses, which remain a major source of security; vulnerabilities in C. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to eliminate this class of bugs; by turning OOB accesses into deterministic traps. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension offers bounds annotations that programmers can; use to attach bounds to pointers. For example, programmers can add the; ``__counted_by(N)`` annotation to parameter ``ptr``, indicating that the pointer; has ``N`` valid elements:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int *__counted_by(N) ptr, size_t N);. Using this bounds information, the compiler inserts bounds checks on every; pointer dereference, ensuring that the program does not access memory outside; the specified bounds. The compiler requires programmers to provide enough bounds; information so that the accesses can be checked at either run time or compile; time — and it rejects code if it cannot. The most important contribution of ``-fbounds-safety`` is how it reduces the; programmer's annotation burden by reconciling bounds annotations at ABI; boundaries with the use of implicit wide pointers (a.k.a. ""fat"" pointers) that; carry bounds information on local variables without the need for annotations. We; designed this model so that it preserves ABI compatibility with C while; minimizing adoption effort. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension has been adopted on millions of lines of; production C code and proven to work in a consumer operating system setting. The; extension was designed to enable incremental adoption — a key requirement in; real-world settings where modifying an entire project and its dependencies all; at once is often not possible.

At a high level,; the pass will lay out referenced globals in a consecutive memory region in; the object file, construct bit vectors that map onto that memory region,; and generate code at each of the ``llvm.type.test`` call sites to test; pointers against those bit vectors. Because of the layout manipulation, the; globals' definitions must be available at LTO time. For more information,; see the `control flow integrity design document`_. A type identifier that identifies functions is transformed into a jump table,; which is a block of code consisting of one branch instruction for each; of the functions associated with the type identifier that branches to the; target function. The pass will redirect any taken function addresses to the; corresponding jump table entry. In the object file's symbol table, the jump; table entries take the identities of the original functions, so that addresses; taken outside the module will pass any verification done inside the module. Jump tables may call external functions, so their definitions need not; be available at LTO time. Note that if an externally defined function is; associated with a type identifier, there is no guarantee that its identity; within the module will be the same as its identity outside of the module,; as the former will be the jump table entry if a jump table is necessary.

Implemented new gROOT->GetTutorialsDir() static method to return the actual location of the tutorials directory.; This is $ROOTSYS/tutorials when not configuring with --prefix or -Dgnuinstall for CMake. ### TColor. Add an enum to access the palette by name. Add new palettes with 255 colors. Names and colors' definitions have been taken from; [here](http://www.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp/~noji/colormap). Except for the `kBird` palette.; These palettes can be accessed with `gStyle->SetPalette(num)`. `num` can be taken; within the following enum:. * kDeepSea = 51; * kGreyScale = 52; * kDarkBodyRadiator = 53; * kBlueYellow = 54; * kRainBow = 55; * kInvertedDarkBodyRadiator = 56; * kBird = 57; * kCubehelix = 58; * kGreenRedViolet = 59; * kBlueRedYellow = 60; * kOcean = 61; * kColorPrintableOnGrey = 62; * kAlpine = 63; * kAquamarine = 64; * kArmy = 65; * kAtlantic = 66; * kAurora = 67; * kAvocado = 68; * kBeach = 69; * kBlackBody = 70; * kBlueGreenYellow = 71; * kBrownCyan = 72; * kCMYK = 73; * kCandy = 74; * kCherry = 75; * kCoffee = 76; * kDarkRainBow = 77; * kDarkTerrain = 78; * kFall = 79; * kFruitPunch = 80; * kFuchsia = 81; * kGreyYellow = 82; * kGreenBrownTerrain = 83; * kGreenPink = 84; * kIsland = 85; * kLake = 86; * kLigh",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md:3873,access,access,3873,README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,1,['access'],['access']

Release is similar to Acquire, but with a barrier of the sort necessary to; release a lock. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_release``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Release only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with an Acquire; operation. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move loads from after a Release store or read-modify-write; operation to before it, and move non-Release stores from after a Release; operation to before it. Notes for code generation; See the section on Acquire; a fence before the relevant operation is usually; sufficient for Release. Note that a store-store fence is not sufficient to; implement Release semantics; store-store fences are generally not exposed to; IR because they are extremely difficult to use correctly. AcquireRelease; --------------. AcquireRelease (``acq_rel`` in IR) provides both an Acquire and a Release; barrier (for fences and operations which both read and write memory). Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_acq_rel``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Acquire only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with a Release; operation, and vice versa. Notes for optimizers; In general, optimizers should treat this like a nothrow call; the possible; optimizations are usually not interesting. Notes for code generation; This operation has Acquire and Release semantics; see the sections on Acquire; and Release. SequentiallyConsistent; ----------------------.

Security,"CGI interface. [FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).; After restarting apache server one should be able to open address: `http://apache_host_name/root.app/`.; There are many ways to configure user authentication in Apache. Example of digest auth for FastCGI server:. ```; <Location ""/root.app/"">; AuthType Digest; AuthName ""root""; AuthDigestDomain ""/root.app/"" ""root""; AuthDigestProvider file; AuthUserFile ""/srv/auth/auth.txt""; Require valid-user; </Location>; ```. ### Configure fastcgi with lighttpd.

It allows to translate some datatypes from `C++` to R; inside the R environment and vice versa in an easy way to get the most from both R and ROOT.; To ease the sending and receiving of data in both environments, I overloaded the operators `<<`,`>>` and `[]`; which make look the job as a flow of data between environments, we will see more of that later.; With this tool you ca use any library or R package wich allows you to access a big amount of benefits to make statistical analysis.; ROOTR also has a R events processing system, which allows to use the R graphical system from `C++`. ## INSTALLATION; To install ROOTR please read first. - [https://root.cern.ch/building-root](https://root.cern.ch/building-root); - [https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites). ### COMPILING ROOTR ON MAC WITH CMAKE:; **NOTE:** Mac OSX Yosemite last xcode and without macports. **Prerequisites**. - xcode; - [xquartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/); - [R last version](https://www.r-project.org); - [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/).

Almost all uses of addresses in DWARF are limited to defining location; descriptions, or to be dereferenced to read memory. The exception is; ``DW_CFA_val_offset`` which uses the address to set the value of a register. In; order to support address spaces, the CFA DWARF expression is defined to be a; memory location description. This allows it to specify an address space which is; used to convert the offset address back to an address in that address space. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. This approach of extending memory location descriptions to support address; spaces, allows all existing DWARF Version 5 expressions to have the identical; semantics. It allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is; using. For example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a; swizzled manner when mapping a source language thread to the lane of a wavefront; in a SIMT manner. Or a compiler could choose to access it in an unswizzled; manner if mapping the same language with the wavefront being the thread. It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private; memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an; unswizzled manner, while using a swizzled private memory for SIMT variable; access. This approach also allows memory location descriptions for different address; spaces to be combined using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations. Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage. They give freedom to the; consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane; information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory location; description and no extra information. The same set of operations can operate on; locations independent of their kind of storage.

Security,"DataFlowSanitizer Design Document; =================================. This document sets out the design for DataFlowSanitizer, a general; dynamic data flow analysis. Unlike other Sanitizer tools, this tool is; not designed to detect a specific class of bugs on its own. Instead,; it provides a generic dynamic data flow analysis framework to be used; by clients to help detect application-specific issues within their; own code. DataFlowSanitizer is a program instrumentation which can associate; a number of taint labels with any data stored in any memory region; accessible by the program. The analysis is dynamic, which means that; it operates on a running program, and tracks how the labels propagate; through that program. Use Cases; ---------. This instrumentation can be used as a tool to help monitor how data; flows from a program's inputs (sources) to its outputs (sinks).; This has applications from a privacy/security perspective in that; one can audit how a sensitive data item is used within a program and; ensure it isn't exiting the program anywhere it shouldn't be. Interface; ---------. A number of functions are provided which will attach taint labels to; memory regions and extract the set of labels associated with a; specific memory region.

Basically right now at the basic block level, each basic block contains an ; instruction list (returned by getInstList()) that is a ValueHolder of ; instructions.

To add or remove an instruction from a basic block, we need to get an ; iterator to an instruction, which, given just an Instruction*, requires a ; linear search of the basic block the instruction is contained in... just ; to insert an instruction before another instruction, or to delete an ; instruction! This complicates algorithms that should be very simple (like ; simple constant propagation), because they aren't actually sparse anymore,; they have to traverse basic blocks to remove constant propogated ; instructions. Additionally, adding or removing instructions to a basic block ; _invalidates all iterators_ pointing into that block, which is really ; irritating.

Access tags are; tuples consisting of a base type, an access type and an offset. The base; type is a scalar type descriptor or a struct type descriptor, the access; type is a scalar type descriptor, and the offset is a constant integer. The access tag ``(BaseTy, AccessTy, Offset)`` can describe one of two; things:. * If ``BaseTy`` is a struct type, the tag describes a memory access (load; or store) of a value of type ``AccessTy`` contained in the struct type; ``BaseTy`` at offset ``Offset``. * If ``BaseTy`` is a scalar type, ``Offset`` must be 0 and ``BaseTy`` and; ``AccessTy`` must be the same; and the access tag describes a scalar; access with scalar type ``AccessTy``. We first define an ``ImmediateParent`` relation on ``(BaseTy, Offset)``; tuples this way:. * If ``BaseTy`` is a scalar type then ``ImmediateParent(BaseTy, 0)`` is; ``(ParentTy, 0)`` where ``ParentTy`` is the parent of the scalar type as; described in the TBAA metadata. ``ImmediateParent(BaseTy, Offset)`` is; undefined if ``Offset`` is non-zero. * If ``BaseTy`` is a struct type then ``ImmediateParent(BaseTy, Offset)``; is ``(NewTy, NewOffset)`` where ``NewTy`` is the type contained in; ``BaseTy`` at offset ``Offset`` and ``NewOffset`` is ``Offset`` adjusted; to be relative within that inner type.

Precautions should be taken to avoid disclosing particularly sensitive data included in the report (e.g. username and password pairs). Changes to the Policy; =====================. The LLVM Security Policy may be changed by majority vote of the LLVM Security Group. Such changes also need to be approved by the LLVM Board. What is considered a security issue?; ====================================. The LLVM Project has a significant amount of code, and not all of it is; considered security-sensitive. This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC. In some cases, parts of the codebase could be handled; as security-sensitive but need significant work to get to the stage where that's; manageable. The LLVM community will need to decide whether it wants to invest in; making these parts of the code securable, and maintain these security; properties over time. In all cases the LLVM Security Group should be consulted,; since they'll be responding to security issues filed against these parts of the; codebase.

Although installing ``cppyy`` through `conda-forge`_ is recommended, it is; possible to build/install with ``pip`` under Anaconda/miniconda. Typical Python extensions only expose a C interface for use through the; Python C-API, requiring only calling conventions (and the Python C-API; version, of course) to match to be binary compatible.; Here, cppyy differs because it exposes C++ APIs: it thus requires a C++; run-time that is ABI compatible with the C++ compiler that was used during; build-time. A set of modern compilers is available through conda-forge, but are only; intended for use with ``conda-build``.; In particular, the corresponding run-time is installed (for use through rpath; when building), but not set up.; That is, the conda compilers are added to ``PATH`` but not their libraries; to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` (Mac, Linux; ``PATH`` for both on MS Windows).; Thus, you get the conda compilers and your system libraries mixed in the same; build environment, unless you set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` (``PATH`` on Windows); explicitly, e.g. by adding ``$CONDA_PREFIX/lib``.; Note that the conda documentation recommends against this.; Furthermore, the compilers from conda-forge are not vanilla distributions:; header files have been modified, which can can lead to parsing problems if; your system C library does not support C11, for example.

Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the `manager class`; at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion.

The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level.

Security,"Histograms. Fitting a histogram with a Python function is no more difficult than; plotting: instantiate a **`TF1`** with the Python callable and supply; that **`TF1`** as a parameter to the `Fit()` member function of the; histogram. After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the; **`TF1`** instance. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # create a linear function for fitting; f = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2). # create and fill a histogram; h = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.); f2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.); h.FillRandom('cf2',10000). # fit the histo with the python 'linear' function; h.Fit(f). # print results; par = f.GetParameters(); print('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1]); ```. ### Working with Trees. Next to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most; common part of any analysis. The **`TTree`** implementation uses; pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed; up access. Consequently, mapping **`TTree`** functionality to Python is; not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented; in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if; you require all of them. #### Accessing an Existing Tree. Let us assume that you have a file containing **`TTrees`**,; **`TChains`**, or **`TNtuples`** and want to read the contents for use; in your analysis code. This is commonly the case when you work with the; result of the reconstruction software of your experiment (e.g. the; combined ntuple in ATLAS). The following example code outlines the main; steps (you can run it on the result of the `tree1.C` macro):. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile. # open the file; myfile = TFile('tree1.root'). # retrieve the ntuple of interest; mychain = myfile.Get('t1'); entries = mychain.GetEntriesFast(). for jentry in xrange(entries):; # get the next tree in the chain and verify; ientry ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:28435,access,access,28435,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"IRgen optimization opportunities. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. The common pattern of; --; short x; // or char, etc; (x == 10); --; generates an zext/sext of x which can easily be avoided. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Bitfields accesses can be shifted to simplify masking and sign; extension.

It may be worth avoiding creation of alloca's for formal arguments; for the common situation where the argument is never written to or has; its address taken. The idea would be to begin generating code by using; the argument directly and if its address is taken or it is stored to; then generate the alloca and patch up the existing code. In theory, the same optimization could be a win for block local; variables as long as the declaration dominates all statements in the; block. NOTE: The main case we care about this for is for -O0 -g compile time; performance, and in that scenario we will need to emit the alloca; anyway currently to emit proper debug info. So this is blocked by; being able to emit debug information which refers to an LLVM; temporary, not an alloca. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//.

Classes for which a Streamer function was externally provided are no longer; split; they were split in v5 if the dictionary was generated via rootcint but; were not split if the dictionary was generated via genreflex. Classes with a custom Streamer function and classes with an older, non StreamerInfo; based automatic streamer are also no longer split. To force the splitting of those classes, thus by-passing the custom Streamer,; when storing the object in a TTree and in a collection object, use:. ``` {.cpp}; TClass::GetClass(classname)->SetCanSplit(true);; ```. ### I/O Schema Checksum. The algorithm used to calculate a single number giving an indication on whether; the schema layout has changed (i.e. if two StreamerInfo are equivalent) have; been update to. - Use the normalized name for the types (i.e. two different spelling of the same; name will lead to the same checksum); - Take into account the base classes' checksum in the derived class checksum;; this is necessary to properly support base classes during memberwise streaming.

A **`TObjArray`** is a collection which supports traditional array; semantics via the overloading of `operator[]`. Objects can be directly; accessed via an index. The array expands automatically when objects are; added. At creation time one specifies the default array size (default =; 16) and lower bound (default = 0). Resizing involves a re-allocation and; a copy of the old array to the new. This can be costly if done too; often. If possible, set initial size close to expected final size. Index; validity is always checked (if you are 100% sure and maximum performance; is needed you can use `UnCheckedAt()` instead of `At()` or; `operator[]`). If the stored objects are sort able the array can be; sorted using `Sort()`. Once sorted, efficient searching is possible via; the `BinarySearch()` method.

Our recommended method of nomination may change as our `Discussion Medium`_ story evolves over time. Choosing new members; --------------------. If a nomination for LLVM Security Group membership is supported by a majority of existing LLVM Security Group members, then it carries within five business days unless an existing member of the Security Group objects. If an objection is raised, the LLVM Security Group members should discuss the matter and try to come to consensus; failing this, the nomination will succeed only by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the LLVM Security Group.

Keeping Membership Current; --------------------------. * At least every six months, the LLVM Security Group applies the above criteria. The membership list is pruned accordingly.; * Any Security Group member can ask that the criteria be applied within the next five business days.; * If a member of the LLVM Security Group does not act in accordance with the letter and spirit of this policy, then their LLVM Security Group membership can be revoked by a majority vote of the members, not including the person under consideration for revocation.

This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline.

Security,"OOT enables; access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python; bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from; the python interpreter. ## PyROOT Overview. The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming,; including high performance and distributed parallel code (see; <http://www.scipy.org>). It is the second most popular scripting; language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a ""glue language"":; practically every library and application these days comes with Python; bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated). `PyROOT`, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT; class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it; allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus; the ""glue-ing"" of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or; applications that provide Python bindings. Further, `PyROOT` can be; loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary); access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of; `PyROOT` is through a few examples. ### Glue-ing Applications. The `PyQt` library, see <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt>,; provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework (; <http://www.trolltech.com>). With `PyROOT` and `PyQt`, adding ROOT; application layer code to a Qt GUI, becomes children play. The following; example shows how a Python class can be used to have ROOT code respond; to a click on a Qt widget. ``` {.cpp}; # Glue-ing Qt and ROOT through Python; import sys, ROOT; from qt import *. theApp = QApplication( sys.argv); box = QVBox(); box.resize(QSize(40,10).expandedTo(box.minimumSizeHint())). class myButton(QPushButton):; def __init__( self,label,master):; QPushButton.__init__(self,label,master); self.setFont( QFont('Times',18,QFont.Bold)). def browse(self):; self.b = ROOT.TBrowser(). bb = myButton('browser',box); QObject.connect( bb,SIGNAL('c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:1627,access,access,1627,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['access'],['access']

To avoid this problem, the user has to synchronize these; actions with:. ``` {.cpp}; TThread::Lock() // Locking the following part of code; ... // Create an object, etc...; TThread::UnLock() // Unlocking; ```. The code between `Lock()` and `UnLock()` will be performed; uninterrupted. No other threads can perform actions or access; objects/collections while it is being executed. The methods; `TThread::Lock() `and **`TThread::UnLock()`** internally use a global; `TMutex` instance for locking. The user may also define their own **`TMutex`** `MyMutex` instance and may; locally protect their asynchronous actions by calling `MyMutex.Lock()` and; `MyMutex.UnLock().`. #### Synchronous Actions: TCondition. To synchronize the actions of different threads you can use the; **`TCondition`** class, which provides a signaling mechanism. The; **`TCondition`** instance must be accessible by all threads that need to; use it, i.e. it should be a global object (or a member of the class; which owns the threaded methods, see below). To create a; **`TCondition`** object, a **`TMutex`** instance is required for the; Wait and `TimedWait` locking methods.

No Normalization; ----------------. The ``mapping()`` method is responsible, if needed, for normalizing and; denormalizing. In a simple case where the native data structure requires no; normalization, the mapping method just uses mapOptional() or mapRequired() to; bind the struct's fields to YAML key names. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Person> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Person &info) {; io.mapRequired(""name"", info.name);; io.mapOptional(""hat-size"", info.hatSize);; }; };. Normalization; ----------------. When [de]normalization is required, the mapping() method needs a way to access; normalized values as fields. To help with this, there is; a template MappingNormalization<> which you can then use to automatically; do the normalization and denormalization. The template is used to create; a local variable in your mapping() method which contains the normalized keys. Suppose you have native data type; Polar which specifies a position in polar coordinates (distance, angle):. .. code-block:: c++. struct Polar {; float distance;; float angle;; };. but you've decided the normalized YAML for should be in x,y coordinates. That; is, you want the yaml to look like:. .. code-block:: yaml. x: 10.3; y: -4.7. You can support this by defining a MappingTraits that normalizes the polar; coordinates to x,y coordinates when writing YAML and denormalizes x,y; coordinates into polar when reading YAML. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Polar> {. class NormalizedPolar {; public:; Normali",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst:17186,access,access,17186,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,1,['access'],['access']

A vector can be constructed from its coordinate representation:. ~~~{.cpp}; ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiMVector v1(10. /*pt*/, 0.1 /*eta*/, 0.24 /*phi*/, 5 /*M*/);; ~~~. In addition, the vector classes can be constructed from any object that implements the; accessors x(), y() and z(). This can be a vector using a different coordinate; system, or even an object from a different package as long as it implements the required signatures.; One such vector type is CLHEP's `Hep3Vector`:. ~~~{.cpp}; XYZVector v1(1,2,3);; RhoEtaPhiVector r2(v1);; CLHEP::Hep3Vector q(1,2,3);; XYZVector v3(q); ~~~. ### Arithmetic Operations. The following operations are possible between vector classes, even of different; coordinate system types:. ~~~{.cpp}; v1 += v2;; v1 -= v2;; v1 = - v2;; v1 *= a;; v1 /= a;; v2 = a * v1;; v2 = v1 / a;; v2 = v1 * a;; v3 = v1 + v2;; v3 = v1 - v2;; ~~~. Note that the multiplication between two vectors using the `operator *` is not supported; because it is ambiguous. ### Other Methods. The vector classes support methods for:. - computation of the dot product via Dot(),; - computation of the cross product via Cross(),; - construction of a unit vector via Unit(). \anchor GenVectorTransformations; ## Transf",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/genvector/doc/index.md:6453,access,accessors,6453,math/genvector/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/genvector/doc/index.md,1,['access'],['accessors']

While several approaches are being actively pursued to mitigate specific; branches and/or loads inside especially risky software (most notably various OS; kernels), these approaches require manual and/or static analysis aided auditing; of code and explicit source changes to apply the mitigation. They are unlikely; to scale well to large applications.

Security,"This global bin is useful to access the bin information independently; of the dimension. ### Re-binning; \index{histogram!rebin}. At any time, a histogram can be re-binned via the **`TH1`**`::Rebin()`; method. It returns a new histogram with the re-binned contents. If bin; errors were stored, they are recomputed during the re-binning. ## Filling Histograms. A histogram is typically filled with statements like:. ``` {.cpp}; h1->Fill(x);; h1->Fill(x,w); // with weight; h2->Fill(x,y);; h2->Fill(x,y,w);; h3->Fill(x,y,z);; h3->Fill(x,y,z,w);; ```. The `Fill` method computes the bin number corresponding to the given; x, y or z argument and increments this bin by the given weight. The; `Fill()` method returns the bin number for 1-D histograms or global; bin number for 2-D and 3-D histograms. If **`TH1`**`::Sumw2()` has; been called before filling, the sum of squares is also stored. One can; increment a bin number directly by calling; **`TH1`**`::AddBinContent()`, replace the existing content via; **`TH1`**`::SetBinContent()` , and access the bin content of a given; bin via **`TH1`**`::GetBinContent()` . ``` {.cpp}; Double_t binContent = h->GetBinContent(bin);; ```. ### Automatic Re-binning Option. By default, the number of bins is computed using the range of the; axis. You can change this to re-bin automatically by setting the; automatic re-binning option:. ``` {.cpp}; h->SetBit(TH1::kCanRebin);; ```; \index{histogram!rebin}. Once this is set, the `Fill()` method will automatically extend the; axis range to accommodate the new value specified in the `Fill()`; argument. The used method is to double the bin size until the new; value fits in the range, merging bins two by two. The; **`TTree`**`::Draw()` method extensively uses this automatic binning; option when drawing histograms of variables in **`TTree`** with an; unknown range.

Security,"Thread(""memberfunction"",; (void(*)(void *))&Thread0,(void*) this);; mTh->Run();; return 0;; }; return 1;; }; ```. Here `mTh` is a `TThread*` pointer which is member of `Myclass `and; should be initialized to 0 in the constructor. The **`TThread`**; constructor is called as when we used a plain C function above, except; for the following two differences. First, the member function Thread0 requires an explicit cast to; `(void(*) (void *)`). This may cause an annoying but harmless compiler; warning:. ``` {.cpp}; Myclass.cxx:98: warning:; converting from ""void (Myclass::*)(void *)""to ""void *"" ); ```. Strictly speaking, `Thread0` must be a static member function to be; called from a thread. Some compilers, for example `gcc` version 2.95.2,; may not allow the `(void(*) (void*))s` cast and just stop if `Thread0`; is not static. On the other hand, if `Thread0` is static, no compiler; warnings are generated at all. Because the `'this'` pointer is passed in; `'arg'` in the call to `Thread0(void *arg),` you have access to the; instance of the class even if `Thread0` is static. Using the `'this'`; pointer, non static members can still be read and written from; `Thread0`, as long as you have provided Getter and Setter methods for; these members. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t state = arg->GetRunStatus();; arg->SetRunStatus(state);; ```.

So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In; C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost; compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly; futile to do something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; ```. Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you; will not see the destructor message. As explained in the Script; lesson, you can load in compound statements, which would be a bit; pointless if everything disappeared as soon as it was loaded! Instead,; to reset the stack you have to type:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```. This sends the Reset message via the global pointer to the ROOT; object, which, amongst its many roles, acts as a resource manager.; Start ROOT again and type in the following:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(4.,5.,-6.);; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```.

The performance overhead of this technique is likely to be very significant and; something users wish to control or reduce. There are interesting options here; that impact the implementation strategy used. One particularly appealing option is to allow both opt-in and opt-out of this; mitigation at reasonably fine granularity such as on a per-function basis,; including intelligent handling of inlining decisions -- protected code can be; prevented from inlining into unprotected code, and unprotected code will become; protected when inlined into protected code.

For both limiting the scope of mitigation or manually mitigating hot functions,; there needs to be some support for mixing mitigated and unmitigated code; without completely defeating the mitigation. For the first use case, it would; be particularly desirable that mitigated code remains safe when being called; during misspeculation from unmitigated code.

Security,"When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object; that derives from **`TObject`** has a `Paint()` method. It may be empty,; but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to; paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of; objects it owns, it will call successively the `Paint()` method of each; object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen. If the object is a; sub-pad, its `Paint()` method will call the `Paint()` method of the; objects attached, recursively calling `Paint()` for all the objects. ![Pad painting](pictures/pad_02.png). In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution. To; force the pad painting `gPad->Update()` (see next section) should be performed. The list of primitives stored in the pad is also used to pick objects; and to interact with them. ### The Global Pad: gPad. When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For; every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad,; whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called; ***`gPad`***. It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to; change the fill color of the active pad to blue but you do not know its; name, do this. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetFillColor(38); ```. To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph ""Color and color; palettes"" or if you have an opened canvas, click on the `View` menu,; selecting the `Colors` item. #### Finding an Object in a Pad. Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, ***`gPad`*** and that we; know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to; access one of those objects. The method `GetPrimitive()` of **`TPad`**,; i.e. `TPad::GetPrimitive(const char* name)` does exactly this. Since; most of the objects that a pad contains derive from **`TObject`**, they; have a name.

Security,"^^^. C++11 [class.cdtor]p4 describes how the vtable of an object is modified as it is; being constructed or destructed; that is, the type of the object depends on; which base constructors have been completed. This is tracked using; DynamicTypeInfo in the DynamicTypePropagation checker. There are several limitations in the current implementation:. * Temporaries are poorly modeled right now because we're not confident in the; placement of their destructors in the CFG. We currently won't inline their; constructors unless the destructor is trivial, and don't process their; destructors at all, not even to invalidate the region. * 'new' is poorly modeled due to some nasty CFG/design issues. This is tracked; in PR12014. 'delete' is not modeled at all. * Arrays of objects are modeled very poorly right now. ExprEngine currently; only simulates the first constructor and first destructor. Because of this,; ExprEngine does not inline any constructors or destructors for arrays. CallEvent; ^^^^^^^^^. A CallEvent represents a specific call to a function, method, or other body of; code. It is path-sensitive, containing both the current state (ProgramStateRef); and stack space (LocationContext), and provides uniform access to the argument; values and return type of a call, no matter how the call is written in the; source or what sort of code body is being invoked. NOTE: For those familiar with Cocoa, CallEvent is roughly equivalent to; NSInvocation. CallEvent should be used whenever there is logic dealing with function calls; that does not care how the call occurred. Examples include checking that arguments satisfy preconditions (such as; __attribute__((nonnull))), and attempting to inline a call. CallEvents are reference-counted objects managed by a CallEventManager.

It is therefore; customary to use the so-called 'response files' to circumvent this; restriction. These files are mentioned on the command-line (using the ""@file""); syntax. The program reads these files and inserts the contents into argv,; thereby working around the command-line length limits. Top-Level Classes and Functions; -------------------------------. Despite all of the built-in flexibility, the CommandLine option library really; only consists of one function `cl::ParseCommandLineOptions`_ and three main; classes: `cl::opt`_, `cl::list`_, and `cl::alias`_. This section describes; these three classes in detail. .. _cl::getRegisteredOptions:. The ``cl::getRegisteredOptions`` function; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``cl::getRegisteredOptions`` function is designed to give a programmer; access to declared non-positional command line options so that how they appear; in ``-help`` can be modified prior to calling `cl::ParseCommandLineOptions`_.; Note this method should not be called during any static initialisation because; it cannot be guaranteed that all options will have been initialised. Hence it; should be called from ``main``. This function can be used to gain access to options declared in libraries that; the tool writer may not have direct access to. The function retrieves a :ref:`StringMap <dss_stringmap>` that maps the option; string (e.g. ``-help``) to an ``Option*``. Here is an example of how the function could be used:. .. code-block:: c++. using namespace llvm;; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; cl::OptionCategory AnotherCategory(""Some options"");. StringMap<cl::Option*> &Map = cl::getRegisteredOptions();. //Unhide useful option and put it in a different category; assert(Map.count(""print-all-options"") > 0);; Map[""print-all-options""]->setHiddenFlag(cl::NotHidden);; Map[""print-all-options""]->setCate",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:51369,access,access,51369,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['access'],['access']

This rule isn't quite what we want: it will rewrite ``my_object.child().foo()`` to; ``my_object.foo()``, but it will also rewrite ``my_ptr->child().foo()`` to; ``my_ptr.foo()``, which is not what we intend. We could fix this by restricting; the pattern with ``not(isArrow())`` in the definition of ``child_call``. Yet, we; *want* to rewrite calls through pointers. To capture this idiom, we provide the ``access`` combinator to intelligently; construct a field/method access.

Security,"`. General purpose structured; exceptions (SEH) are more analogous to Linux signals, and they are dispatched by; userspace DLLs provided with Windows. Each frame on the stack has an assigned EH; personality routine, which decides what actions to take to handle the exception.; There are a few major personalities for C and C++ code: the C++ personality; (``__CxxFrameHandler3``) and the SEH personalities (``_except_handler3``,; ``_except_handler4``, and ``__C_specific_handler``). All of them implement; cleanups by calling back into a ""funclet"" contained in the parent function. Funclets, in this context, are regions of the parent function that can be called; as though they were a function pointer with a very special calling convention.; The frame pointer of the parent frame is passed into the funclet either using; the standard EBP register or as the first parameter register, depending on the; architecture. The funclet implements the EH action by accessing local variables; in memory through the frame pointer, and returning some appropriate value,; continuing the EH process. No variables live in to or out of the funclet can be; allocated in registers. The C++ personality also uses funclets to contain the code for catch blocks; (i.e. all user code between the braces in ``catch (Type obj) { ... }``). The; runtime must use funclets for catch bodies because the C++ exception object is; allocated in a child stack frame of the function handling the exception. If the; runtime rewound the stack back to frame of the catch, the memory holding the; exception would be overwritten quickly by subsequent function calls. The use of; funclets also allows ``__CxxFrameHandler3`` to implement rethrow without; resorting to TLS. Instead, the runtime throws a special exception, and then uses; SEH (``__try / __except``) to resume execution with new information in the child; frame.

In practice, very few places in the API require the explicit specification of a; ``LLVMContext``, other than the ``Type`` creation/lookup APIs. Because every; ``Type`` carries a reference to its owning context, most other entities can; determine what context they belong to by looking at their own ``Type``. If you; are adding new entities to LLVM IR, please try to maintain this interface; design. .. _jitthreading:. Threads and the JIT; -------------------. LLVM's ""eager"" JIT compiler is safe to use in threaded programs. Multiple; threads can call ``ExecutionEngine::getPointerToFunction()`` or; ``ExecutionEngine::runFunction()`` concurrently, and multiple threads can run; code output by the JIT concurrently. The user must still ensure that only one; thread accesses IR in a given ``LLVMContext`` while another thread might be; modifying it. One way to do that is to always hold the JIT lock while accessing; IR outside the JIT (the JIT *modifies* the IR by adding ``CallbackVH``\ s).; Another way is to only call ``getPointerToFunction()`` from the; ``LLVMContext``'s thread. When the JIT is configured to compile lazily (using; ``ExecutionEngine::DisableLazyCompilation(false)``), there is currently a `race; condition <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5184>`_ in updating call sites; after a function is lazily-jitted. It's still possible to use the lazy JIT in a; threaded program if you ensure that only one thread at a time can call any; particular lazy stub and that the JIT lock guards any IR access, but we suggest; using only the eager JIT in threaded programs. .. _advanced:.

The first three arguments are the same as they are in the :ref:`@llvm.memset <int_memset>`; intrinsic, with the added constraint that ``len`` is required to be a positive integer; multiple of the ``element_size``. If ``len`` is not a positive integer multiple of; ``element_size``, then the behaviour of the intrinsic is undefined. ``element_size`` must be a compile-time constant positive power of two no greater than; target-specific atomic access size limit. The ``dest`` input pointer must have the ``align`` parameter attribute specified. It; must be a power of two no less than the ``element_size``. Caller guarantees that; the destination pointer is aligned to that boundary. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.memset.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsic sets the ``len`` bytes of; memory starting at the destination location to the given ``value``. The memory is; set with a sequence of store operations where each access is guaranteed to be a; multiple of ``element_size`` bytes wide and aligned at an ``element_size`` boundary. The order of the assignment is unspecified. Only one write is issued to the; destination buffer per element.

The analysis must be able to determine whether a lock is held, or not held, at; every program point. Thus, sections of code where a lock *might be held* will; generate spurious warnings (false positives). For example:. .. code-block:: c++. void foo() {; bool b = needsToLock();; if (b) mu.Lock();; ... // Warning! Mutex 'mu' is not held on every path through here.; if (b) mu.Unlock();; }. No checking inside constructors and destructors.; ------------------------------------------------. The analysis currently does not do any checking inside constructors or; destructors. In other words, every constructor and destructor is treated as; if it was annotated with ``NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS``.; The reason for this is that during initialization, only one thread typically; has access to the object which is being initialized, and it is thus safe (and; common practice) to initialize guarded members without acquiring any locks.; The same is true of destructors. Ideally, the analysis would allow initialization of guarded members inside the; object being initialized or destroyed, while still enforcing the usual access; restrictions on everything else. However, this is difficult to enforce in; practice, because in complex pointer-based data structures, it is hard to; determine what data is owned by the enclosing object. No inlining.; ------------. Thread safety analysis is strictly intra-procedural, just like ordinary type; checking. It relies only on the declared attributes of a function, and will; not attempt to inline any method calls. As a result, code such as the; following will not work:. .. code-block:: c++. template<class T>; class AutoCleanup {; T* object;; void (T::*mp)();. public:; AutoCleanup(T* obj, void (T::*imp)()) : object(obj), mp(imp) { }; ~AutoCleanup() { (object->*mp)(); }; };",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:22188,access,access,22188,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Python has an elaborate array interface (buffer) specification, but no; standard library array type that completely implements it; instead, the; canonical Python array type is the NumPy one.; cppyy introduces the basic ``LowLevelView`` array class to avoid having a; direct dependency on NumPy and to guarantee zero copy.; The ``LowLevelView`` type gives access to array details such as the size,; type, etc. and allows reading/writing of array elements, both for interactive; use and through the buffer interface to allow NumPy to interface with them.; For more complex operations, it's recommended to copy from the; ``LowLevelView`` inta a NumPy array, or to create a NumPy view (see below,; under :ref:`NumPy Casts <npcasts>`). `C/C++ casts`; -------------. C++ instances are auto-casted to the most derived available type, so do not; require explicit casts even when a function returns a pointer to a base; class or interface.; However, when given only a ``void*`` or ``intptr_t`` type on return, a cast; is required to turn it into something usable. * **bind_object**: This is the preferred method to proxy a C++ address,; and lives in ``cppyy``, not ``cppyy.ll``, as it is not a low-level C++; cast, but a ``cppyy`` API that is also used internally.; It thus plays well with object identity, references, etc.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppde",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst:1427,access,access,1427,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst,1,['access'],['access']

However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. %res = call <16 x float> @llvm.masked.load.v16f32.p0(ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1>%mask, <16 x float> %passthru). ;; The result of the two following instructions is identical aside from potential memory access exception; %loadlal = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %loadlal, <16 x float> %passthru. .. _int_mstore:. '``llvm.masked.store.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic. The data stored in memory is a vector of any integer, floating-point or pointer data type. ::. declare void @llvm.masked.store.v8i32.p0 (<8 x i32> <value>, ptr <ptr>, i32 <alignment>, <8 x i1> <mask>); declare void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> <value>, ptr <ptr>, i32 <alignment>, <16 x i1> <mask>); ;; The data is a vector of pointers; declare void @llvm.masked.store.v8p0.p0 (<8 x ptr> <value>, ptr <ptr>, i32 <alignment>, <8 x i1> <mask>).

Security,"a reference to the underlying type (same; example: Instruction&) instead of a pointer to the underlying object. This; makes it much easier to write nested loops that iterator over things, changing; this:. for (Function::iterator BI = Func->begin(); BI != Func->end(); ++BI); for (BasicBlock::iterator II = (*BI)->begin(); II != (*BI)->end(); ++II); (*II)->dump();. into:. for (Function::iterator BI = Func->begin(); BI != Func->end(); ++BI); for (BasicBlock::iterator II = BI->begin(); II != BI->end(); ++II); II->dump();. which is much more natural and what users expect. * Simplification of #include's: Before, it was necessary for a .cpp file to; include every .h file that it used. Now things are batched a little bit more; to make it easier to use. Specifically, the include graph now includes these; edges:; Module.h -> Function.h, GlobalVariable.h; Function.h -> BasicBlock.h, Argument.h; BasicBlock.h -> Instruction.h. Which means that #including Function.h is usually sufficient for getting the; lower level #includes. * Printing out a Value* has now changed: Printing a Value* will soon print out; the address of the value instead of the contents of the Value. To print out; the contents, you must convert it to a reference with (for example); 'cout << *I' instead of 'cout << I;'. This conversion is not yet complete,; but will be eventually. In the mean time, both forms print out the contents. * References are used much more throughout the code base. In general, if a; pointer is known to never be null, it is passed in as a reference instead of a; pointer. For example, the instruction visitor class uses references instead; of pointers, and that Pass subclasses now all receive references to Values; instead of pointers, because they may never be null. * The Function class now has helper functions for accessing the Arguments list.; Instead of having to go through getArgumentList for simple things like; iterator over the arguments, now the a*() methods can be used to access them.

Security,"a subtle semantic difference: the Python; ``__new__`` allocates memory for the proxy object only, and ``__init__``; initializes the proxy by creating or binding the C++ object.; Thus, no C++ memory is allocated until ``__init__``.; The advantages are simple: the proxy can now check whether it is initialized,; because the pointer to C++ memory will be NULL if not; it can be a reference; to another proxy holding the actual C++ memory; and it can now transparently; implement a C++ smart pointer.; If ``__init__`` is never called, eg. when a call to the base class; ``__init__`` is missing in a derived class override, then accessing the proxy; will result in a Python ``ReferenceError`` exception. `Destructors`; -------------. There should no be reason to call a destructor directly in CPython, but e.g.; PyPy uses a garbage collector and that makes it sometimes useful to destruct; a C++ object exactly when you want it destroyed.; Destructors are by convention accessible through the ``__destruct__`` method; (since ""~"" can not be part of a Python method name).; If a Python-side derived class overrides ``__destruct__``, that method will; be called when the instance gets deleted in C++.; The Python destructor, ``__del__``, gets called when the Python proxy goes; away, which will only delete the C++ instance if owned by Python.; Note that ``__del__`` is not guaranteed to be called, it may e.g. be skipped; on program shutdown or because of an outstanding exception.; Accessing an object after it has been destroyed using ``__destruct__`` will; result in a Python ``ReferenceError`` exception. `Inheritance`; -------------. The output of help shows the inheritance hierarchy, constructors, public; methods, and public data.; For example, ``Concrete`` inherits from ``Abstract`` and it has; a constructor that takes an ``int`` argument, with a default value of 42.; Consider:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Abstract; >>> issubclass(Concrete, Abstract); True; >>> a = Abstr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/classes.rst:2975,access,accessible,2975,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/classes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/classes.rst,1,['access'],['accessible']

[FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).; After restarting apache server one should be able to open address: `http://apache_host_name/root.app/`.; There are many ways to configure user authentication in Apache.

Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag. This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the full; tag interpretation (where the pointer tag is between 1 and `TG-1` and the; last byte of the granule is ordinary data) and the short tag interpretation; (where the pointer tag is stored in the granule). When HWASAN detects an error near a memory tag between 1 and `TG-1`, it; will show both the memory tag and the last byte of the granule.

Refer to the; [address sanitizer documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or use `ASAN_OPTIONS=help=1` when starting; up a sanitised executable (e.g. `root.exe`). A template for a leak suppression file can be found in `$ROOTSYS/etc/lsan-root.supp`. ## Create your own sanitised executable; ROOT exports a library target called `ROOT::ROOTStaticSanitizerConfig` that can be used to create sanitised executables with ROOT's default; address sanitizer config. Linking against this target will add the above setup functions and also add the address sanitizer flags that; ROOT was built with. It should be sufficient to; - Link all executables against this target; - And have `-fsanitize=address` in the `CXXFLAGS`. ## Use sanitised ROOT libraries from a non-sanitised executable (e.g. `python`); When ROOT libraries are built with sanitizers, the address sanitizer runtime needs to be loaded at startup. However, when calling into ROOT; functions from python, that won't happen, since python is not sanitised. Therefore, the address sanitizer runtime has to be preloaded with; `LD_PRELOAD=<pathToRuntime>:libROOTSanitizerConfig.<so|dylib> pythonX ROOTScript.py`. Preloading the shared sanitizer config as above is optional, but recommended, because it adds leak sanitizer suppressions. On Mac, preloading is theoretically possible, but code signing and many other barriers might make it difficult.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md:2390,sanitiz,sanitizer,2390,core/sanitizer/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md,6,['sanitiz'],"['sanitizer', 'sanitizers']"

The ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata refers to one or more; access group metadata nodes (see ``llvm.access.group``). It denotes that; no loop-carried memory dependence exist between it and other instructions; in the loop with this metadata. Let ``m1`` and ``m2`` be two instructions that both have the; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata to the access group ``g1``, respectively; ``g2`` (which might be identical). If a loop contains both access groups; in its ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the compiler can; assume that there is no dependency between ``m1`` and ``m2`` carried by; this loop. Instructions that belong to multiple access groups are; considered having this property if at least one of the access groups; matches the ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` list. If all memory-accessing instructions in a loop have; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata that each refer to one of the access; groups of a loop's ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the; loop has no loop carried memory dependences and is considered to be a; parallel loop. Note that if not all memory access instructions belong to an access; group referred to by ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``, then the loop must; not be considered trivially parallel.

Security,"ad their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`. A change in the argument handling of `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` might need your attention:; these macros now respect whether a header file was passed with its full relative path (the common case), or with a full path.; The latter allows to find headers at runtime - at the cost of a loss of relocatability: you cannot move the library containing; that dictionary to a different directory, because the header location is stored in the dictionary. This case is used by roottest; but should likely not be used by anything but test suites. Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time.

Security,"adata format is very simple. ``!tbaa.struct`` metadata; nodes are a list of operands which are in conceptual groups of three.; For each group of three, the first operand gives the byte offset of a; field in bytes, the second gives its size in bytes, and the third gives; its tbaa tag. e.g.:. .. code-block:: llvm. !4 = !{ i64 0, i64 4, !1, i64 8, i64 4, !2 }. This describes a struct with two fields. The first is at offset 0 bytes; with size 4 bytes, and has tbaa tag !1. The second is at offset 8 bytes; and has size 4 bytes and has tbaa tag !2. Note that the fields need not be contiguous. In this example, there is a; 4 byte gap between the two fields. This gap represents padding which; does not carry useful data and need not be preserved. '``noalias``' and '``alias.scope``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``noalias`` and ``alias.scope`` metadata provide the ability to specify generic; noalias memory-access sets. This means that some collection of memory access; instructions (loads, stores, memory-accessing calls, etc.) that carry; ``noalias`` metadata can specifically be specified not to alias with some other; collection of memory access instructions that carry ``alias.scope`` metadata.; Each type of metadata specifies a list of scopes where each scope has an id and; a domain. When evaluating an aliasing query, if for some domain, the set; of scopes with that domain in one instruction's ``alias.scope`` list is a; subset of (or equal to) the set of scopes for that domain in another; instruction's ``noalias`` list, then the two memory accesses are assumed not to; alias. Because scopes in one domain don't affect scopes in other domains, separate; domains can be used to compose multiple independent noalias sets. This is; used for example during inlining. As the noalias function parameters are; turned into noalias scope metadata, a new domain is used every time the; function is inlined.

Any error message returned by the ``validate()``; method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed.; When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML; key/values are written.

Discussion Medium; =================. *FUTURE*: this section needs more work! Where discussions occur is influenced by other factors that are still open in this document. We can finalize it later.; It seems like bugzilla and email don't meet security requirements. The medium used to host LLVM Security Group discussions is security-sensitive. It should therefore run on infrastructure which can meet our security expectations. We are currently using the `chromium issue tracker`_ (as the `llvm` project) to have security discussions:. * File security issues.; * Discuss security improvements to LLVM. When a new issue is filed, a template is provided to help issue reporters provide all relevant information. *FUTURE*: The `Github security`_ workflow allows publicly disclosing resolved security issues on the github project page, and we would be interested in adopting it for that purpose. However, it does not easily allow confidential reporting of security issues, as creating Github Security Advisories is currently restricted to Github project admins. That is why we have started with the `chromium issue tracker`_ instead. We also occasionally need to discuss logistics of the LLVM Security Group itself:. * Nominate new members.; * Propose member removal.; * Suggest policy changes. We often have these discussions publicly, in our :ref:`monthly public sync-up call <online-sync-ups>` and on the Discourse forums.

The entries can be set by `TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n)`.; Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries; is null. ### Viewing the Tree. ![The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram](pictures/030000FC.png). In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: `ev`,; `px`, `py`, `pz`, and `random`. Note that these are shown as leaves; because they are ""end"" branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf,; we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree; `t1` looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other; operations for histogramming the leaves. See ""The Tree Viewer"". For; example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram. ![The tree viewer](pictures/030000FE.png). ### Reading the Tree. The `tree1r` function shows how to read the tree and access each entry; and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values. ``` {.cpp}; Float_t px, py, pz;; ```. Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry.; We do this with the method `TTree::SetBranchAddress`. The first; parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the; variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the; branch name is `px`. This name was given when the tree was written (see; `tree1w`). The second parameter is the address of the variable `px`. ``` {.cpp}; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; ```. #### GetEntry. Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be; read into the variables with the method `TTree::GetEntry(n)`. It; reads all the branches for entry (n) and populates the given address; accordingly. By default, `GetEntry()` reuses the space allocated by the; previous object for each branch.

Pointer parameter without corresponding ``Param`` is considered unsafe and we; assume that access with any offset is possible. Example:. If we have the following function:. .. code-block:: text. define i64 @foo(ptr %0, ptr %1, ptr %2, i8 %3) {; store ptr %1, ptr @x; %5 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i64 5; %6 = load i8, ptr %5; %7 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i8 %3; tail call void @bar(i8 %3, ptr %7); %8 = load i64, ptr %0; ret i64 %8; }.

The function may access just 8 bytes of the parameter %0 . ``calls`` is empty,; so the parameter is either not used for function calls or ``offset`` already; covers all accesses from nested function calls.; Parameter %1 escapes, so access is unknown.; The function itself can access just a single byte of the parameter %2. Additional; access is possible inside of the ``@bar`` or ``^3``. The function adds signed; offset to the pointer and passes the result as the argument %1 into ``^3``.; This record itself does not tell us how ``^3`` will access the parameter.; Parameter %3 is not a pointer. .. _refs_summary:.

See; `full documentation; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#suppressions>`_; for more details. Code generation control; =======================. Instrumentation code outlining; ------------------------------. By default AddressSanitizer inlines the instrumentation code to improve the; run-time performance, which leads to increased binary size. Using the; (clang flag ``-fsanitize-address-outline-instrumentation` default: ``false``); flag forces all code instrumentation to be outlined, which reduces the size; of the generated code, but also reduces the run-time performance. Limitations; ===========. * AddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. Exact overhead; depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the allocations you make the; bigger the overhead is.; * AddressSanitizer uses more stack memory. We have seen up to 3x increase.; * On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves) 16+ Terabytes of; virtual address space. This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as; usually expected.; * Static linking of executables is not supported. Supported Platforms; ===================. AddressSanitizer is supported on:. * Linux i386/x86\_64 (tested on Ubuntu 12.04); * macOS 10.7 - 10.11 (i386/x86\_64); * iOS Simulator; * Android ARM; * NetBSD i386/x86\_64; * FreeBSD i386/x86\_64 (tested on FreeBSD 11-current); * Windows 8.1+ (i386/x86\_64). Ports to various other platforms are in progress. Current Status; ==============. AddressSanitizer is fully functional on supported platforms starting from LLVM; 3.1. The test suite is integrated into CMake build and can be run with ``make; check-asan`` command. The Windows port is functional and is used by Chrome and Firefox, but it is not; as well supported as the other ports.

Security,"ample: BOOST_PP_STRINGIZE. .. END_FORMAT_STYLE_OPTIONS. Adding additional style options; ===============================. Each additional style option adds costs to the clang-format project. Some of; these costs affect the clang-format development itself, as we need to make; sure that any given combination of options work and that new features don't; break any of the existing options in any way. There are also costs for end users; as options become less discoverable and people have to think about and make a; decision on options they don't really care about. The goal of the clang-format project is more on the side of supporting a; limited set of styles really well as opposed to supporting every single style; used by a codebase somewhere in the wild. Of course, we do want to support all; major projects and thus have established the following bar for adding style; options. Each new style option must .. * be used in a project of significant size (have dozens of contributors); * have a publicly accessible style guide; * have a person willing to contribute and maintain patches.

This gap represents padding which; does not carry useful data and need not be preserved. '``noalias``' and '``alias.scope``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``noalias`` and ``alias.scope`` metadata provide the ability to specify generic; noalias memory-access sets. This means that some collection of memory access; instructions (loads, stores, memory-accessing calls, etc.) that carry; ``noalias`` metadata can specifically be specified not to alias with some other; collection of memory access instructions that carry ``alias.scope`` metadata.; Each type of metadata specifies a list of scopes where each scope has an id and; a domain. When evaluating an aliasing query, if for some domain, the set; of scopes with that domain in one instruction's ``alias.scope`` list is a; subset of (or equal to) the set of scopes for that domain in another; instruction's ``noalias`` list, then the two memory accesses are assumed not to; alias. Because scopes in one domain don't affect scopes in other domains, separate; domains can be used to compose multiple independent noalias sets. This is; used for example during inlining. As the noalias function parameters are; turned into noalias scope metadata, a new domain is used every time the; function is inlined. The metadata identifying each domain is itself a list containing one or two; entries. The first entry is the name of the domain. Note that if the name is a; string then it can be combined across functions and translation units. A; self-reference can be used to create globally unique domain names. A; descriptive string may optionally be provided as a second list entry. The metadata identifying each scope is also itself a list containing two or; three entries.

There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important.

For more detail, read through ``RegionStoreManager::removeSubRegionBindings`` in; RegionStore.cpp. ObjCIvarRegions; ---------------. Objective-C instance variables require a bit of special handling. Like struct; fields, they are not base regions, and when their parent object region is; invalidated, all the instance variables must be invalidated as well. However,; they have no concrete compile-time offsets (in the modern, ""non-fragile""; runtime), and so cannot easily be represented as an offset from the start of; the object in the analyzer. Moreover, this means that invalidating a single; instance variable should *not* invalidate the rest of the object, since unlike; struct fields or array elements there is no way to perform pointer arithmetic; to access another instance variable. Consequently, although the base region of an ObjCIvarRegion is the entire; object, RegionStore offsets are computed from the start of the instance; variable. Thus it is not valid to assume that all bindings with non-symbolic; offsets start from the base region!. Region Invalidation; -------------------. Unlike binding invalidation, region invalidation occurs when the entire; contents of a region may have changed---say, because it has been passed to a; function the analyzer can model, like memcpy, or because its address has; escaped, usually as an argument to an opaque function call. In these cases we; need to throw away not just all bindings within the region itself, but within; its entire cluster, since neighboring regions may be accessed via pointer; arithmetic. Region invalidation typically does even more than this, however. Because it; usually represents the co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst:3284,access,access,3284,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"ant #1.1 and #1.2 attacks: ""Bounds Check Bypass Store"". Beyond the core variant #1 attack, there are techniques to extend this attack.; The primary technique is known as ""Bounds Check Bypass Store"" and is discussed; in this research paper: https://people.csail.mit.edu/vlk/spectre11.pdf. We will analyze these two variants independently. First, variant #1.1 works by; speculatively storing over the return address after a bounds check bypass. This; speculative store then ends up being used by the CPU during speculative; execution of the return, potentially directing speculative execution to; arbitrary gadgets in the binary. Let's look at an example.; ```; unsigned char local_buffer[4];; unsigned char *untrusted_data_from_caller = ...;; unsigned long untrusted_size_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_size_from_caller < sizeof(local_buffer)) {; // Speculative execution enters here with a too-large size.; memcpy(local_buffer, untrusted_data_from_caller,; untrusted_size_from_caller);; // The stack has now been smashed, writing an attacker-controlled; // address over the return address.; minor_processing(local_buffer);; return;; // Control will speculate to the attacker-written address.; }; ```. However, this can be mitigated by hardening the load of the return address just; like any other load. This is sometimes complicated because x86 for example; *implicitly* loads the return address off the stack. However, the; implementation technique below is specifically designed to mitigate this; implicit load by using the stack pointer to communicate misspeculation between; functions. This additionally causes a misspeculation to have an invalid stack; pointer and never be able to read the speculatively stored return address. See; the detailed discussion below. For variant #1.2, the attacker speculatively stores into the vtable or jump; table used to implement an indirect call or indirect jump. Because this is; speculative, this will often be possible even when these are stored in; rea",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:11990,attack,attacker-controlled,11990,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['attack'],['attacker-controlled']
Security,"any problem. This is called **overriding**; a method. Draw in **`TArrow`** overrides Draw in **`TLine`**. There is; no possible ambiguity since, when one calls the `Draw()` method; this; applies to an object whose type is known. Suppose we have an object; `l` of type **`TLine`** and an object `a` of type **`TArrow`**. When; you want to draw the line, you do:. ``` {.cpp}; l.Draw();; ```. `Draw()` from **`TLine`** is called. If you do:. ``` {.cpp}; a.Draw();; ```. `Draw()` from **`TArrow`** is called and the arrow `a` is drawn. ### Data Encapsulation. We have seen previously the keyword ""`public`"". This keyword means; that every name declared public is seen by the outside world. This is; opposed to ""`private`"" that means only the class where the name was; declared private could see this name. For example, suppose we declare; in **`TArrow`** the variable `ArrowHeadSize` private. ``` {.cpp}; private:; int ArrowHeadSize;; ```. Then, only the methods (i.e. member functions) of **`TArrow`** will be; able to access this variable. Nobody else will see it. Even the; classes that we could derive from **`TArrow`** will not see it. On the; other hand, if we declare the method `Draw()` as public, everybody will; be able to see it and use it. You see that the character public or; private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data; member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case; of **`TArrow`**, the base class **`TLine`** is declared as public:. ``` {.cpp}; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; ```. This means that all methods of **`TArrow`** will be able to access all; methods of **`TLine`**, but this will be also true for anybody in the; outside world. Of course, this is true if **`TLine`** accepts the; outside world to see its methods/data members. If something is; declared private in **`TLine`**, nobody will see it, not even; **`TArrow`** members, even if **`TLine`** is declared as a public; base class.

Security,"apabilities are associated with named C++ objects which declare specific; methods to acquire and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.) These act like keys; or tokens that allow the thread to access a given resource. Just like physical; security keys, a thread cannot make copy of a capability, nor can it destroy; one. A thread can only release a capability to another thread, or acquire one; from another thread. The annotations are deliberately agnostic about the; exact mechanism used to acquire and release capabilities; it assumes that the; underlying implementation (e.g. the Mutex implementation) does the handoff in; an appropriate manner. The set of capabilities that are actually held by a given thread at a given; point in program execution is a run-time concept. The static analysis works; by calculating an approximation of that set, called the *capability; environment*. The capability environment is calculated for every program point,; and describes the set of capabilities that are statically known to be held, or; not held, at that particular point. This environment is a conservative; approximation of the full set of capabilities that will actually held ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:4889,access,access,4889,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['access'],['access']

The ``@import`` declaration above imports the entire contents of the ``std`` module (which would contain, e.g., the entire C or C++ standard library) and make its API available within the current translation unit. To import only part of a module, one may use dot syntax to specific a particular submodule, e.g.,. .. parsed-literal::. @import std.io;. Redundant import declarations are ignored, and one is free to import modules at any point within the translation unit, so long as the import declaration is at global scope. At present, there is no C or C++ syntax for import declarations. Clang; will track the modules proposal in the C++ committee. See the section; `Includes as imports`_ to see how modules get imported today. Includes as imports; -------------------; The primary user-level feature of modules is the import operation, which provides access to the API of software libraries. However, today's programs make extensive use of ``#include``, and it is unrealistic to assume that all of this code will change overnight. Instead, modules automatically translate ``#include`` directives into the corresponding module import. For example, the include directive. .. code-block:: c. #include <stdio.h>. will be automatically mapped to an import of the module ``std.io``. Even with specific ``import`` syntax in the language, this particular feature is important for both adoption and backward compatibility: automatic translation of ``#include`` to ``import`` allows an application to get the benefits of modules (for all modules-enabled libraries) without any changes to the application itself. Thus, users can easily use modules with one compiler while falling back to the preprocessor-inclusion mechanism with other compilers. .. note::.

Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type). This type of directive has no security implications, but may present; performance impacts. Design Ideas; ============. This tool will disassemble binaries and DSO's from their machine code format and; analyse the disassembled machine code. The tool will inspect virtual calls and; indirect function calls. This tool will also inspect indirect jumps, as inlined; functions and jump tables should also be subject to CFI protections. Non-virtual; calls (``-fsanitize=cfi-nvcall``) and cast checks (``-fsanitize=cfi-*cast*``); are not implemented due to a lack of information provided by the bytecode.

We then enforce the use; of transformations as rotations or translations (additions) for; modifying the vector contents. - The majority of the functionality, which is present in the CLHEP; package, involving operations on two vectors, is moved in separated; helper functions (see `ROOT::Math::VectorUtil`). This has the; advantage that the basic interface will remain more stable with time; while additional functions can be added easily. #### Naming Convention. As part of ROOT, the `GenVector` package adheres to the prescribed ROOT; naming convention, with some (approved) exceptions, as described here:. - Every class and function is in the **`ROOT::Math`** namespace. - Member function names start with upper-case letter, apart some; exceptions (see the next section about CLHEP compatibility). #### Compatibility with CLHEP Vector Classes. - For backward compatibility with CLHEP the vector classes can be; constructed from a CLHEP `HepVector` or **`HepLorentzVector`**, by; using a template constructor, which requires only that the classes; implement the accessors` x()`, `y()`, and `z()` (and `t()` for the; 4D). - We provide vector member function with the same naming convention as; CLHEP for the most used functions like `x()`, `y()` and `z()`. #### Connection to Linear Algebra Package. In some use cases, like in track reconstruction, it is needed to use the; content of the vector and rotation classes in conjunction with linear; algebra operations.

Otherwise, if the resulting output differs from the; reference output, it assumes the difference resulted from a code generator; failure, and starts the `code generator debugger`_. Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it.

If an optimizer or code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` will try as hard as it; can to reduce the list of passes (for optimizer crashes) and the size of the; test program. First, ``bugpoint`` figures out which combination of optimizer; passes triggers the bug. This is useful when debugging a problem exposed by; ``opt``, for example, because it runs over 38 passes. Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure. At the end, ``bugpoint`` should tell you what passes crash, give you a; bitcode file, and give you instructions on how to reproduce the failure with; ``opt`` or ``llc``. .. _code generator debugger:.

To make that easier,; a ``getLoopAnalysisUsage`` function is provided by ``LoopUtils.h``. It can be; called within the subclass's ``getAnalysisUsage`` override to get consistent; and correct behavior. Analogously, ``INITIALIZE_PASS_DEPENDENCY(LoopPass)``; will initialize this set of function analyses.

The ``doInitialization`` method is designed to do simple initialization type of; stuff that does not depend on the functions being processed. The; ``doInitialization`` method call is not scheduled to overlap with any other; pass executions (thus it should be very fast). ``LPPassManager`` interface; should be used to access ``Function`` or ``Module`` level analysis information. .. _writing-an-llvm-pass-runOnLoop:.

Note that everything in this file is; contained in an anonymous namespace --- this reflects the fact that passes; are self contained units that do not need external interfaces (although they; can have them) to be useful. Running a pass with ``opt``; ---------------------------. Now that you have a brand new shiny shared object file, we can use the; :program:`opt` command to run an LLVM program through your pass. Because you; registered your pass with ``RegisterPass``, you will be able to use the; :program:`opt` tool to access it, once loaded. To test it, follow the example at the end of the :doc:`GettingStarted` to; compile ""Hello World"" to LLVM. We can now run the bitcode file (hello.bc) for; the program through our transformation like this (or course, any bitcode file; will work):. .. code-block:: console. $ opt -load lib/LLVMHello.so -hello < hello.bc > /dev/null; Hello: __main; Hello: puts; Hello: main. The :option:`-load` option specifies that :program:`opt` should load your pass; as a shared object, which makes ""``-hello``"" a valid command line argument; (which is one reason you need to :ref:`register your pass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-registration>`). Because the Hello pass does not modify; the program in any interesting way, we just throw away the result of; :program:`opt` (sending it to ``/dev/null``). To see what happened to the other string you registered, try running; :program:`opt` with the :option:`-help` option:. .. code-block:: console. $ opt -",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst:7947,access,access,7947,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"asses on the second function in the module, and so on.; This is better for cache locality around LLVM data structures. This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines.
