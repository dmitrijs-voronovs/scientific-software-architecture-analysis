Testability,"@jullee . 1. Yes, running in mitochondria-mode is somewhat like running in tumor-only mode because you don't have a matched normal. We have found that the false positive rate is very reasonable and comparable to other tools for mitochondria (including HaplotypeCaller). Your latter point (we're looking for calls at various allele fractions) is exactly why we chose to use Mutect instead of HaplotypeCaller. 2. I don't think we can currently output bp resolution reference confidence in Mutect2. There is development being done to allow Mutect to output a GVCF (which would give you reference confidence) but this is still a work in progress. You might be able to use the ""Genotype Given Alleles"" argument to force Mutect to output qualities at each base, but I haven't tested this at all. 3. We found that value for --min-pruning by looking at whole genome sequencing data. Both HaplotypeCaller and Mutect do a local reassembly at a potential variant site. This reassembly builds a graph where each path is a potential haplotype. The min-pruning argument tells you how many reads each path needs to have in order to be considered (otherwise it is pruned from the graph). By default this value is 1 which makes sense for 30-60X data, but if your coverage is very high (which it usually is for mitochondria) the graph will be too messy due to errors unless you turn that argument up. Because the depth is so high, you need more evidence to be sure a path in the graph isn't just noise. 4. The ploidy argument isn't used by Mutect2 because it is always looking for variation at arbitrary allele fractions. If you are instead using HaplotypeCaller you would need to change that argument either to 1 (this would only allow you to call HomVar sites) or as high as you need to get desired resolution. In other words if you want to be able to call sites at 1% allele fraction, you will need to set the ploidy argument to 100 if you are running HaplotypeCaller. Mutect2 will look for sites at all allele fract",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5193#issuecomment-432645864:770,test,tested,770,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5193#issuecomment-432645864,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"@kachulis Interesting, this change has highlighted the fact that DBSNP (or the one we have checked in anyway) is full of duplicate variants with different IDs.

It looks like the tests don't actually check those scores exactly, it is probably unrelated now that I see we compare QUAL scores by:; `private static final double DEFAULT_FLOAT_TOLERANCE = 1e-1;` but it seems that there is a consistent 0.04 QUAL score change at almost every site in that file....; I would recommend trying to regenerate that file without your code change and if you see the same QUAL behavior then go ahead and merge (I just want to be sure that the splitting code is not destructive in some unforeseen way).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6626#issuecomment-639550318:406,test,tests,406,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6626#issuecomment-639550318,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@kdatta @kgururaj We have some questions about this pull request. It looks like maybe you forgot some commits, (and included some extra ones that you didn't intend to). . 1. The tests are a direct copy and paste of `PrintReadsIntegrationTests` and couldn't possibly run. Did you forget to push the commit with the actual test code? We really need some tests especially because it's not totally obvious how to use this tool and what needs to be in the jsons. . 2. The tool currently takes a partition index and a json with stream ids. The way we had envisioned this working was that it would take a `-V` argument with a list of vcfs and `-L` argument specifying what chunk of the genome to load. Can you explain why it is designed this way and if it is possible to change to use the more idiomatic input style? . 3. Can you let us know when 0.4.0 is available on maven? .

Testability,"@kdatta That's the right way to compare variants. Comparing variants is complicated so it's possible you've hit a bug in the comparator. . MIN_DP should be an integer, so it's funny that i's being treated as a double somewhere. Could you look at the site that's failing and check if ; 1) the expected output file I provided you has a 27.0 there or if it's 27 ( I grepped the file and didn't find any `27.0` as the MIN_DP but I could have missed it...); 2) your generated output file has 27.0 and not 27 (it's easy to mess up the ordering of expected and actual in the test code); 3. Check that the header of your output file reports MIN_DP as an Integer and not a Float or Double. If none of those are true than it sounds like a bug in the comparator.

Testability,"@kguraj Thanks for the response(s). The test in the PR was super useful as a temporary test, but as you mentioned it runs pretty slowly, and as it stands the test passes on current master anyway. It seems to require on the order of 9000-1000 intervals instead rather than 1000 to actually hit stack overflow. Since that would be a very slow running test, I'm inclined to back it out. Also, the user who originally reported the issue was using 11k intervals, and it seems that the stack overflow fix is unlikely to help in that case. Is there any guidance for users on what is a reasonable number of intervals per process ? It sounds like the intention was that it be used with pretty small intervals.

Testability,"@lbergelson @KevinCLydon This branch now passes all tests, is rebased onto the latest master, and is (finally) using the official GATK Python environment rather than the custom NVIDIA-provided one. I had to add two additional Python dependencies to our environment, and make some small modifications to the Python code to account for a newer version of pytorch-lightning that was required. The final outstanding issue in this PR is that I had to temporarily comment out the Jacoco coverage report code in our build.gradle and dockertest.gradle files, due to a bizarre problem where Jacoco was attempting to read/parse the new Pytorch model files added in this branch. This will have to be resolved before we can merge (or we might have to permanently disable Jacoco if it can't be...). After this is merged, there will have to be a second PR that adds the CNN tools to the `DeprecatedToolsRegistry`, and actually removes the legacy tools.

Testability,"@lbergelson I just tested with one of our variants in the test suite for HaplotyeCaller (specifically `20	10098219	.	TATATATA	T,<NON_REF>`) and its definately the case that HaplotypeCaller will still output that variant even if you place the -L interval boundary inside the variant (like say at `10098221`) but it will fail to call that same deletion if you make the start of your interval anything but the first base of that deletion. . The HaplotypeCaller has its own filtering at Haplotype->Allele->Genotyper layer that restricts it to only calling alleles that START within the active region (excluding padding) which makes it impossible to output deletions starting before the provided intervals even if they overlap into the specified region. The HaplotypeCaller will however output deletions that go past the end of the provided -L intervals so long as they begin within the intervals in question. The HaplotypeCaller is hopelessly fickle and everything within a few thousand bases of the edge of the calling intervals is subject to start-position/calling failures and any given site may or may not disappear to assembly failures when close to the edge. Adjusting these settings at the VCF writer level could prevent the latter case from occurring (by filtering them with some strict setting to prevent deletions from overhanging the end of the -L region) but it cannot ever allow the former case to exist (that is to say it will never force a deletion from a few bases before the interval to be called by HaplotypeCaller since it will never send that allele to the genotyper under any circumstance). ; ; I would say that your branch adds an entirely new and subtle way for users to get confused about what the HaplotypeCaller is actually doing under the hood and why they did or didn't see a particular variant so we should tread carefully.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670:19,test,tested,19,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"@lbergelson I think it doesn't actually need to implement max and min at all because those are only used in unit tests. Furthermore, the `kmerCounts` in `AssemblyResultSet` themselves are only used in such methods i.e. they don't need to be members at all. You could delete `CountSet` entirely without replacing it. And even if you keep it there it is definitely not crucial for performance and could easily be any old `SortedSet`. So, the options are 1) replace with `TreeSet` or whatever; 2) delete entirely.

Testability,"@lbergelson I understand the change of userClassPathFirst can cause problems.; About the new parameter, I shouldn't have ""pull request"" it. It's absolutly unnecessary as `--conf 'spark.submit.deployMode=cluster'` works. Plus, as you said, it's hardcoded...; About #3933, I didn't retry the `-- --deploy-mode` solution after my userClassPathFirst modification. I added the parameter in my fork to test. I still think it's important to have it in gatk's parameters because it's simple for users, but it's not an emergency. For me, the userClassPathFirst change is important.

Testability,"@lbergelson I updated to the latest 2.x Mockito and that fixed the problem. The only failing test now is FuncotatorIntegrationTest#nonTrivialLargeDataValidationTest. The output VCF differs in the `FUNCOTATION` annotation, and it’s to do with ordering of the fields. E.g. it will be. ```; 1_%7C_1|false_%7C_false|false_%7C_false; ```; not; ```; false_%7C_false|1_%7C_1|false_%7C_false; ``` .

They are assertion failures from `h5diff` indicating that the actual outputs did not match the expected outputs, so there are likely actual numerical differences here.

Yes, the logic of the pipeline specifies all the commandline arguments, regardless of defaults so that if the defaults change (which the GATK used to do all the time!) the pipeline will not change.

Testability,"@lbergelson, I don't think that this solution will help in this case, because another error when trying to use `CommandLineProgramTest`is that it extends `BaseTest`, which loads directly a `GenomeLocParser` for a reference that is not present and it blows up in every test. Regarding the `Main` class, because you point it out here, I would like to have some control over `Main` and how it manages things like errors or logging header. Basically all the things that I'm facing at the moment are, apart of this error using the testing framework, is that the framework have tons of mentions to the GATK itself (error messages pointing to the GATK manual page or bundle tools), and little control over which of them should be expose to the final user. Only as an example, I would like to output a line with the name and version of my software and a short notice about the usage of the GATK framework and which version I'm using (for easier maintenance, and contribution if a bug is found).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-242802278:268,test,test,268,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-242802278,3,"['log', 'test']","['logging', 'test', 'testing']"

Testability,"@lbergelson. Our simple s3 nio library is not currently open source, but we would be willing to make it so after testing it properly. We found that to get the s3 nio library work with GATK, a few minor changes needed to be made in the GATK source. This is especially true for the spark tools because, on AWS EMR Spark clusters, s3 uris can be treated exactly as if they are HDFS uris. Therefore, it was not quite as simple for us to just add the s3 nio library to the classpath and have everything work as expected. For that reason we put the project on hold until GATK is closer to release.

Testability,"@ldgauthier @davidbenjamin . I now have added in setting the genotype as phased (using a pipe) as well as upgraded htsjdk. The tests need updating, but it's easier to see what breaks then fix than run the tests locally! But please see if you agree with the rest of the PR while I update the tests manually. A few notes on the various tools related to making the genotype phased:. 1. Both `HaplotypeCaller` and `Mutect2` support the `--do-not-run-physical-phasing`, so all this can be turned off by the user. I am not going to add another command line option as this may confuse the user.; 2. `FilterMutectCalls` uses the `Mutect2FilteringEngine` internally. It does not look at the order of the alleles in the genotype (`GT` FORMAT field), but does look at the various other per-allele FORMAT fields (ex. `AD`, `AF`). Fortunately, I do not change their order in this PR as suggested by @ldgauthier.; 3. As @ldguathier note [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433970809) and [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433986488), that VQSR and Sam F's work do not look at genotypes either.; 4.

Testability,@ldgauthier @davidbenjamin please take a look. . Don't allow the number of lines changed intimidate you... (most are in test resource files). The first commit contains the actual main code changes. . The second and third commits update the test resources (where most of the changed lines come from) and test code. . The very last commit changes the default radius to 2... I was planning to set it to 0 since it is more parsimonious (less complex configuration) but it may well affect sensitivity and certainly changes the PL/QUAL values so I guess set the value two the current 2 (for PLs) is a safer and more conservative approach until we evaluate what is the optimal value for this parameter. . Perhaps @davidbenjamin would like to have a different default for Mutec. This is last minute change and may break some of the integration test so bear with me if that is the case.

Testability,"@ldgauthier I think at some point we removed example JSONs in both the CNV and M2 WDL directories. I believe the reasoning was that those JSONs were mostly non-informative templates that could just as easily be generated with `womtool inputs`; since they were also not tested (in contrast to the JSONs used by the Travis WDL tests), they had to be kept in sync manually. @davidbenjamin @LeeTL1220 can correct me if I'm wrong. In contrast, providing Jack's hyperparameters for WES via JSONs will actually be informative! However, we will inevitably run into some issues touched upon in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4719. I agree that it would be desirable to set some default WES/WGS hyperparameters in the featured workspace. However, I hope this wouldn't require two separate workspaces for WES/WGS or any shenanigans like that. Ideally, this sort of thing could be covered at the tool level with argsets, as mentioned in that issue. @droazen any updates there?. In any case, I'm not sure having the JSON in this repo and not covered by any tests is what we want. ; Maybe @bshifaw can chime in? Are the featured workspaces covered by tests elsewhere? What is the current SOP for taking workflows from this repo, turning them into featured workspaces, and populating their configurations?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6017#issuecomment-505971851:269,test,tested,269,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6017#issuecomment-505971851,4,['test'],"['tested', 'tests']"
Testability,"@ldgauthier I think it's probably best to try and get to the bottom of why this variant's qual isn't being adjusted as it's reduced from 7 alleles in the gVCF to 2 alleles in the called VCF. This is, as you guessed, all single-sample. I've attached a reduced gVCF that just includes the variant in question, and the resulting genotyped VCF from running the command line below (and their indices) ; [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/3059414/gatk-5793-testcase.tar.gz). ```; gatk GenotypeGVCFs \; -R /Work/refseq/hg19/hg19.fasta \; -V HG02568.g.vcf \; -O HG02568.vcf \; -L chr11:6637700-6637800 \; -stand-call-conf 30; ```. A few observations from running the above command but varying the `-stand-call-conf` at that locus, all performed with GATK 4.1.1.0:; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 30` results in a reduction from 7->2 alleles but no change at all in QUAL; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 0` results in the same genotype and QUAL, but another allele squeaks through even though it's not referenced in the genotype; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 100` results in no variants being emitted. Circling back to one of my original statements, I believe the least confusing way for this to work would be to think of it this way:; - If you run with `-stand-call-conf 0` you should see all variants; - If you run with `-stand-call-conf n` you should only lose variants that were previously emitted with `-stand-call-conf 0` that had QUAL < n. That said, it sounds like maybe the problem is less with the filtering on QUAL and more to do with the calculation of the final QUAL that ends up in the VCF?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5793#issuecomment-481273026:468,test,testcase,468,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5793#issuecomment-481273026,1,['test'],['testcase']

Testability,"@ldgauthier Tests are still failing because I haven't updated test vcfs. Before I do so could I get your opinion? Here's a summary of the rationale behind each commit:. * fa34758 When we get to `realignReadToBestHaplotype` we have discarded bases outside of the assembly region but we still have hard clips in the read Cigar. This change forces us to keep those Cigar elements after realigning to the best haplotype so that we know how far past the assembly window the read extended.; * 6af7ad4 After the above change, `BaseQualityRankSum` was liable to look for discarded bases in the hard-clipped part of the read. This fixes that.; * 952d217 The `Clipping` annotation doesn't do anything. It counts the number of hard clips, but pre-this PR there are no hard clips because those bases don't get realigned to the best haplotype and post-this PR the ""hard clips"" are just bases outside the assembly region. As a placeholder I'm setting it to zero (note how this doesn't break any tests!) but really I think we should just get rid of it.; * This PR introduced some off-by-one errors in the depth annotation (but not the ADs). While looking into this I found an apparent bug where some reads that don't overlap a variant get counted in the depth. The issue was that we were counting clipped bases in the overlap. I don't think this is correct because by this point in the code we have unclipped soft clips and gone through local reassembly. Therefore, anything clipped here is a part of the read we truly don't believe belongs anywhere near the assembly region. This change alone breaks the tests with a few off-by-one DP fields.; * 8c51c0a Uses hard clips in the Cigar to correct read position annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806:12,Test,Tests,12,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806,4,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"@ldgauthier looking at things, I think there are actually a couple of issues.

You'll notice that both `GT` and `PGT` have phased genotypes. And in the case of samples with a homozygous genotype, the `PGT` has an incorrect heterozygous genotype. Going back and looking more closely at the test files that I updated, I also see where the `GT` is `1|1` that the `PGT` is erroneously heterozgyous. In talking to @nh13 about this, he pointed me at a section of code in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine` that purposefully sets the genotype to either `0|1` or `1|0` with a long note on line 512 that this is on purpose and that it'll get ""fixed"" later. Evidently that's not happening on the code path in `HaplotypeCaller` that generates a VCF as opposed to a GVCF. If this PR is likely to get accepted _and_ someone can point me in the right direction for fixing up the `PGT`, I'd be happy to try and fix that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772#issuecomment-471062432:909,test,test,909,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772#issuecomment-471062432,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"@ldgauthier, @meganshand and I discussed whether we might want to switch from the one-sided p-values currently calculated by ExcessHet to mid p-values (which are used in the Hail implementation, see also https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/teaching/SISG14/Graffelman_Moreno_SAGMB_2013.pdf). She said you probably should make the call. As discussed by that reference, there can be significant differences between one-sided and mid p-values. However, since this PR already introduces differences between the old one-sided p-values and the corrected one-sided p-values, perhaps we want to go a step further and just switch over? Advantages would include consistency with Hail, as well as better power and type-1 error rate, at least according to that reference. But the test would no longer be specific to *excess* heterozygosity, which might not be desirable. I would also be curious to see what differences the correction or the switch would have in practice, given that the filter threshold is relatively conservative.

Testability,"@lucidtronix @mbabadi @samuelklee I think the best solution would be to establish a single, common Python environment, with a single set of dependencies, that all GATK Python tools depend on. We would establish a single docker image that has all of these dependencies pip installed, and could also include a conda env for the GATK environment for users who don't want to use the docker image. If we could do that, it would eliminate the need load per-tool conda environments. From what I've seen so far based on existing branches, the two environments we need (gCNV and CNN-VQSR) don't look that far apart in terms of dependencies. gCNV is using Theano, and CNN Tensorflow, but the rest looks [pretty close](https://docs.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/spreadsheets/d/1RV7--uBQ0ctlXzMH09cmr0VimpZYIU68DdxJzE60y-c/edit?usp=sharing). So a strawman proposal for the main components for a common environment would be:. Python 3.6; Numpy >= 1.13.1; Scipy 1.0.0; Theano .0.9.0; Tensorflow 1.4.0; Pymc3 3.1; Keras 2.1.1.

I will work with that and perhaps try to pull out an AbstractPluginDescriptor. @droazen - in the earlier post you mentioned support on porting this. i think we're almost done, but it would be really helpful to test this using the same test data as GATK3 to ensure identical behavior. I dont know if there's any issues preventing sharing those files, but it seems like sharing those, at least privately wit us, should be a relatively straightforward thing.

Testability,"@magicDGS Overall, the documentation changes are good. A few more minor comments: ; - If these are classes that are really pegged to the usage of LIBS, then you may want to mention that in the javadocs for the class. A comment along the lines of ""these classes are fairly low-level, developers should probably confirm that their changes do not belong in a higher-level calss such as LIBS"". ; - I am okay with an informal test of the speed, even if you just look at some logs. From the review, it looks like behavior of higher-level API calls will be unchanged. >I think that because the LocusIteratorByState is already splitting by sample, that can improve even more performance, because it will come directly in the state where it can be used by-sample in an efficient way. And maybe, if the tool does not require to split by sample at all, we can add an option to disable that behavior while creating the tracker. Agreed. I do not think you need to worry about the flag, for now. If you'd like, file an issue, but I think it is low priority for us. I tend to be worried about new developers or contributors getting lost in the codebase. And many do not have experience w/ GATK3.

Testability,"@magicDGS `--nWayOut` is absolutely necessary for co-cleaning tumor-normal pairs of samples. This allows upfront filtering of tumor mutations against the matched-normal, the panel of normals and the germline sites to be much more efficient (in somatic mutation calling). . I will then go ahead and start making a base test dataset. The repo tests look like they tested all sorts of things, e.g. bad CIGARs. Will you be altering the base data I provide towards these other tests or are we focused just on the primary functionality? If more than just a normal dataset is needed, then do specify these requirements. Remember that I do not as of yet understand Java code. It would be helpful to also see the previous test data if its features are what we want to recapitulate. If we are instead making up new tests, then that is fine too. Since you bring up nwayout, it seems the test should accommodate two samples. I was thinking to make alt-ware mapped GRCh38 snippets that included ALT/HLA contigs, just to cover our bases.

Testability,"@magicDGS, after much discussion with @droazen, we will make this test set even smaller. Also, the current test set will be temporary, to unimpede you, until updates to the main test set can be made (discussion to start next week). @cmnbroad says we need to keep an eye out for coverage in the tests, given the need to make this dataset extremely small. So I removed chr17 from the mini-reference, such that only four small snippets of reference from various chromosomes remained. However, it appears there are only two usable indel realignments going on with GATK3. Note thate these are targeted exome samples with comparatively low coverage. [for_magicDGS.zip](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/1820785/for_magicDGS.zip). There are two samples, so as to enable testing nWayOut, and an artificial reference `hg38_Shl01`. The two sites to hone in on are chr11:177568 and chr11:207134. Note also that the BAMs are in an invalid state according to ValidateSamFile. However, GATK3 RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner did not seem to mind. I think these tools should allow processing of BAMs in any validation state. Apologies for the meager state of the data.

Testability,"@magicDGS:. 1. Yes, you're right that you're already correctly testing that you get the right number of shards back. No need for an extra assertion. 2. I think that realistically-sized reads (of differing lengths!) does add to the unit test, since it's important to test with reads that overlap extensively with other reads. You'll also want to vary the read lengths to test with reads of different lengths at the same start position, shorter reads that start after longer reads, and any other arrangements that are significant to your `ShardingIterator`. .

Testability,"@magigDGS There are 4 separate issues in here, and I have slightly different feelings about each of them. Some comments:. - Removing the RNA string seems fine.; - I deliberately left the GATK test program group in because even though there is a Picard one, its harmless, and easier for people to find.; - I have reservations about exposing and sharing the super category maps. The Picard docgen process is pretty much unused and unmaintained at this point. The `getSuperCategoryMap` mthod really shouldn't be public, and it may even be removed in the near future. The GATK supercategory map ""truth"" should be defined by GATK.; - I'm reluctant to make the GATK `getSuperCategoryMap` public, because I don't think it can have any kind of useful contract. Its tied to the GATK doc templates and doc process, which we need to be able to change freely.

Testability,"@mbabadi I've updated my PR to use miniconda3. @mbabadi @lucidtronix @samuelklee I think we should aim for tools that at least run out-of-box, without depending on any out-of-band configuration other than the conda env. On top of that we can provide guidance/configs for users on how to enable further optimizations, like g++. Does that sound like an achievable goal ?. As for the docker, we're going to have strike the right balance between image bloat and performance(including test performance). I think we're around 4+ gig now, and counting. Before the Python integration we were at 1.9G, and trying to find ways to reduce it. So lets see where we wind up but keep that in mind. Finally, we need to find a way to install the (GATK) python package(s) without depending on access to the GATK repo. Right now I think the gCNV branch has a ""pip install from source"" added to the conda env .yml. That will work on the docker at the moment (and thus on travis), but that won't work for non-docker users how don't have source/repo access. Also, one of the proposals to reduce the size of the docker is to remove the repo clone that is currently there. My proposal is that we change the gradle build to create an archive/zip of the python source (this would include the VQSR-CNN package code as well as gCNV kernel). We can then copy that on to the docker image, and pip-install it from the copy. That would retain the ability to always run travis tests based on the code in the repo, and also keep the nightly docker image in sync.

Testability,"@meganshand Here's a quick example:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385742-20a3303b-d8ce-4335-b42f-622da9bfa8d3.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385777-6174f8b8-7abb-4b31-92d1-11cc8064854b.png). Note that the malaria data used was pretty small: chr1-2 training (~20k positive training/truth variants, ~50k negative training variants; note also that the threshold for determining negative training was not tuned---a threshold corresponding to a 98% truth sensitivity was arbitrarily chosen), chr3 validation (~50k variants), and chr4-6 test (~150k variants). The LL score is calculated from a validation set held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png).

Testability,"@mlathara Thanks for the reply. The reason I'm very interested in this is scatter/gather, so in our use-case, the inputs would be identical. Like you say, this would essentially be X jobs initiated with the same command, just different intervals. Merging all the resulting per-contig workspaces back into one workspace has a lot of logistical appeal, and the resulting folder would still be a valid GenomicsDB workspace. The alternate idea we had been considering was to maintain these as a folder of per-workspaces. That might work, but has the downside of not being a 'real' file format.

Testability,"@mlathara The nodes have considerably more (256 or so). is there any rule or thumb or guidance on expected memory needs based on number of gVCFs and/or type of input (WES vs WGS)?. I do think you might be onto something though. Out default cluster submission code takes our slurm job memory request, subtracts only a few GB and passes the remainder to -Xmx/Xms. I will update to leave more buffer as you suggest. Our cluster happens to be undergoing maintenance this week, so this particular job was killed. I'll update the GATK version, add --genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations, and adjust the memory.

Testability,"@mlathara To those points:. - Yes, the test case I tried to make using GATK's test data doesnt show this. When I was working quickly I thought I repro'd it, but as you point out the REF bases for chr20:10-20 are actually Ns, so in this instance GenotypeGVCFs is doing the right thing. - Since my original posts, we figured out new information (posted above). When we simply do a SelectVariants on the genomicsDB workspace over these intervals, it produces a gVCF with Ns listed as the reference. In the actual reference, those sites are not Ns. That's making us look in a different direction than I originally thought.

If there is no I/O difference between the user copying a workspace and updating vs. GenomicsDB reading the input workspace and writing the output to a new location, then I guess I agree that one can make an argument that it's not critical for GenomicsDBImport to execute that copy itself.

Testability,"@nalinigans Thanks for the help on this. I wanted to let you know that even with the standalone tool and improvements, we've basically given up on trying to aggregate whole genome GenomicsDB workspaces with more than ~1000 samples. We can get virtually all the chromosomes to consolidate, but the largest (chr 1) can go for 10 days and eventually dies. It's just too unwieldy to be practical. My current idea is to stage our data into more reasonable workspaces of ~500 samples. These have the benefit of allowing existing data to be static, and we just keep appending/making new workspaces as we get more samples. Since GenotypeGVCFs only allows one input, the plan is:. - Run GenotypeGVCFs once per workspace. This is scattered into a huge number of jobs, so each job is reasonable.; - Take the VCFs from each of these and take the union of all sites.; - Repeat GenotypeGVCFs per workspace, giving it those sites as the whitelist of sites to force genotyping; - Merge the resulting VCFs into one.

We've had a lot of issues getting GATK/GenomicsDB to run effectively on this sample set. We have settled on doing the GenomicsDBImport/append operation with a moderate batch size.

Testability,"@nalinigans pointed out that even if we do switch this pipeline back to the BCF codec, it's still likely to encounter errors with 64-bit values due to some recent changes in GenomicsDB, which now throws an exception for these values instead of silently truncating them as it did in the past. So just switching to the BCF codec in the WDL might not be enough. A couple of other options we discussed today for a quick fix for this issue:. - @ldgauthier suggested that we change the WDL to use an older (pre-4.1.8.0) version of GATK that is known to work well with this pipeline, which would be an easy change. The only problem is that users might run `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` in the latest GATK independently of the WDL anyway and continue to run into this issue. - @nalinigans suggested that we patch `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` so that it does something sensible when the AD annotation is completely missing. Since AD was already likely being truncated by the BCF codec in previous versions of this pipeline, its value was never particularly trustworthy to begin with. Whatever option we go with, we'll need to add a good regression test for the PoN workflow that would have caught this issue. Longer term, we'll plan on developing a fix at the HTSJDK level for the way missing values are handled for the AD and PL annotations in the VCF codec (@lbergelson is currently looking into how this could be done). @fleharty What are your thoughts?

Does the crash only occur with this one particular sample, or have you seen it on more than one sample? If you could get to the point where you can reproduce it on a shareable bam snippet, that would obviously maximize the chances of this getting fixed. Intel is currently (at our request) doing a pass on the GKL with `valgrind` to find and fix memory safety issues (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/107), so we expect the next GKL release to fix a bunch of ""use after free""-type errors.

Testability,"@pgrosu Yes, that's correct. My point is that _in the code_ the factor of 2 in the numerator of your expression appears to be missing. If I have read the code of `GenotypeLikelihoodsCalculator::genotypeLikelihoods` correctly it behaves as follows (calculations are in log space but I have translated to real space; also it divides by ploidy at the end of the calculation instead of per read, but the effect is the same). Suppose (for pedagogical purposes) we have a triploid genotype AAB. Then the likelihood P(R | G = AAB) of read R given the genotype is (2/3) P (R | A) + (1/3) P (R | B). The overall likelihood of genotype AAB is the product of P(R | G) over all reads. This is the likelihood of the _phased_ genotype AAB, and it is the same GL that is used downstream in HaplotypeCaller. I don't see anywhere in the code where the (equal) contribution of a different permutation (eg ABA, BAA) is added, as in the numerator of your expression. Furthermore, it's hard to see where the correct combinatorial factor is hiding, because until you multiply the read likelihoods (add in log space) of all reads, which is a pretty transparent step, you _have to_ work with phased genotypes (since all reads must share the same phased genotype, you have to have a hierarchical model with unphased genotype -> phased genotype -> { all reads }). Thus, if a permutation factor needs to be there, it could only be put in right after all the read likelihoods are multiplied and nowhere else.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235638474:268,log,log,268,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235638474,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"@samuelklee I support exposing these parameters via the command line, but I'd be opposed to any consolidation of parameters that changes the HaplotypeCaller output prior to the initial DRAGEN-GATK release in November, as the evaluations in that project are difficult enough as it is. If you want to do an evaluation to find the best set of SW parameters now, that's fine of course -- but we wouldn't be able to actually merge any breaking HaplotypeCaller changes until after the November DRAGEN-GATK release, and we'd also have to check whether the proposed changes affect the functional equivalence of GATK and DRAGEN (we're developing tests now that can check this). If you want to expose the SW parameters on the CLI now, I think 12 arguments is fine. Just give each argument a clear prefix indicating what it applies to (eg., `--read-to-haplotype-mismatch-penalty`). If a user has gotten to the point where they feel the need to mess with the SW parameters, their command line is probably already long and complex as it is, so adding a few additional arguments won't ruin their day.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6863#issuecomment-705081291:637,test,tests,637,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6863#issuecomment-705081291,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@samuelklee I've worked through all of the issues with the other repos (Barclay, picard, etc.), so we're ready to move forward with Java 17 reviews, but the `ModelSegments` tests are still inconsistent. This branch has updated `ModelSegments` expected result files that were produced locally with Java 17 (based on our discussion from some months ago), but now the same tests still fail on the docker. They succeed when run locally or in the CI non-docker job. At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker). I'm not sure what is causing the instability, but this is going to become a blocking issue for this in the next couple of weeks. We also have the option of disabling them only on the docker (or non-docker), but I hate to do that. Can you take a look at this in the next week or so ?. There is also one WDL test (`CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow.CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`) that fails pretty consistently - I suspect this is a resource/memory issue since it sometimes returns exit code 134. The default CI machines are pitiful things, 7GB IIRC.

Testability,"@samuelklee, thanks for the update and suggestion. I moved CollectAllelicCounts to the `Coverage Analysis` category. CollectFragmentCounts isn't on the list currently so I added it to the same. I hope I'm not missing a bunch of other new tools given I missed this one. . @yfarjoun ; - You are now in charge of deciding whether we should include authorship in code. What the Comms team wants is for authorship to NOT show up in the gatkDoc/javaDoc. If you want to keep them, author lines should be at the bottom and formatted so they do not show up in the documentation. Geraldine is fine with completely removing them if you prefer that. There is a format trick that has javaDoc skip the author line and @vdauwera would know this or I can get you what I see in other docs. Let either of us know.; - I can help you test your changes.

Testability,@sonejilab. As @gokalpcelik the logs should be helpful to figure out what happened. Particularly at the end there should be an accounting of how many reads were filtered by what filters. Possibly something is unexpected about the read flags for the STAR aligned reads and most likely they are being filtered out by the tool. You can disable all of the reads filters using this argument `--disable-tool-default-read-filters` and then re-enable the ones that are relevant. Next I would check that your input files are populated and are on the same reference as the -R input that you specified in your command.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8873#issuecomment-2176212771:32,log,logs,32,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8873#issuecomment-2176212771,1,['log'],['logs']
Testability,"@sooheelee - I think that to have a proper test suite similar to GATK's 3, we need also some test that exercise some code paths that requires some specific scientifically meaningful data (for example, known indels that are also included in some sample). I am not that familiar with the test data on this or GATK3 repository, so I am not sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that. About the target-creator, known indels are really easy to port because the code is within the tool and is simpler - the only problem might be code coverage",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371515115:43,test,test,43,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371515115,3,['test'],['test']

Testability,"@t-ogasawara @frank-y-liu @gspowley @paolonarvaez @droazen @lbergelson please comment on the following proposal. The proposal is that we would spin off native PairHMM as a separate project/repo on github and host AVX code there and have alternative implementations extend that project/repo (by creating repos that depend on the AVX one). . In other words, now we have 1 repo, broadinstitute/gatk. After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one). The avx and ppc repos will have their own build systems and unit tests against the new interface. The AVX repo will expose something like the following Java API (to be worked out in detail). ```; //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from reads; public final class JNIReadDataHolderClass {; public byte[] readBases = null;; public byte[] readQuals = null;; public byte[] insertionGOP = null;; public byte[] deletionGOP = null;; public byte[] overallGCP = null;; }. //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from haplotypes; public final class JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass {; public byte[] haplotypeBases = null;; }. public interface NativePairHMMKernel extends AutoCloseable { . /**; * Function to initialize the fields of JNIReadDataHolderClass and JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass from JVM.; * C++ code gets FieldIDs for these classes once and re-uses these IDs for the remainder of the program.

Testability,@tedsharpe I'm still a bit worried about this. Does `registerClasses` get called multiple times in the life time of the spark executor? I had assumed it was invoked once at startup on a global Kryo instance and then that instance was serialized to all of the nodes. I don't actually know that's the case though. . Have you tested that this works if you have classes that have different registration requirements? Could you add a test that shows that it works to reregister during execution?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1775#issuecomment-215475784:323,test,tested,323,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1775#issuecomment-215475784,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"
Testability,"@tedsharpe I've addressed some of your comments here -- all the simpler stuff plus:. - I now only make distal targets for split reads with one supplementary alignment. We can make a ticket to handle more complex cases at some point.; - I renamed the concept of strand in the `EvidenceTargetLink` and related classes -- I'm now calling it `evidenceUpstreamOfBreakpoint`.; - I canonicalize `EvidenceTargetLinks` and only create them when the source is upstream of the target. This allowed me to get rid of the de-duplication code, so thanks for the suggestion. It seemed tricky to me to try to cluster these links during the initial pass over the reads while at the same time keeping track of coherent evidence. In my testing it doesn't seem like it is slow to run over the `EvidenceRDD` again to do this, but we could think about trying to change this sometime if we're looking for optimizations. .

Testability,@tedsharpe Looks good. Thanks for all the stylistic revisions and additional commenting! . My IDE caught some string comparisons using `==` which could definitely lead to confusing issues down the road. Once you've addressed the comments feel free to rebase and merge. Are you planning on adding integration tests for the tools at some point? They really should have some. I did notice a few edge cases in your code that didn't have any test coverage.

Testability,"@tomwhite @davidadamsphd could you take a look and see if it's in the right direction?. Some notes:; - This is only impl'd for pure Spark at the moment. Gonna work on adding support for dataflow as well.; - It was easier to remove the `final` modifier on the `GATKRead` impl rather than reimplement all the methods and simply pass them through. Let me know if that's ok.; - Should we target Parquet IO only in the context of writing to Hadoop?

Testability,"@tomwhite On the GATK side, I think the steps are:; 1. Rev our Hadoop-BAM dependency once https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/pull/49 is in.; 2. Take one of our existing test inputs and create a copy of it sorted by query name using the hellbender tool `SortSam`. I think a good file to use would be `src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/BQSR/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.ch20.1m-1m1k.NA12878.noMD.noBQSR.bam`, as that file hasn't had either MD or BQSR run on it, and it's the primary input in the `ReadsPipelineSparkIntegrationTest`.; 3. Before making any actual changes to MarkDuplicatesSpark, write a new integration test proving that MarkDuplicatesSpark can read in the queryname-sorted bam above, and produces the same result as when run on the coordinate-sorted version of the bam. The output in both cases when running with `--shardedOutput false` should be a coordinate-sorted bam.; 4. Now the potentially tricky part: in `MarkDuplicatesSpark`, we want to detect queryname-sorted reads using the `SAMFileHeader` SO attribute (`SAMFileHeader.getSortOrder()`), and if we have them, avoid performing the first `groupByKey()` operation in `MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.transformReads()`, instead relying on the natural ordering of the reads to create the `PairedEnds` objects.; 5.

Testability,"@tomwhite Review complete. Thanks for this! . I'm at a bit of a loss for how to test the hadoop bam reading.

Ideally we could have an hdfs layer running on travis that we could query files from in order to test. . At a minimum we need unit tests testing that we can actually read an hdfs file.

Testability,"@tovanadler Review complete. Looks good, just a few comments. I have a few comments about the organization of duplicate marking. I think you've inherited some very old style code that could maybe use some refactoring. I think we do need to also include the histogram and the metrics headers. Those could be done in a separate ticket though. I'm a bit worried that the test is indeterministic. Unless I overlooked something which is likely, it seems like it might depend on the ordering of a PCollection which is undefined. This isn't problematic for the actual metric file, but might be for the tests.

Testability,@vdauwera The latest game plan for this ticket (which is being addressed in #2021) is to have SplitNCigarReads create a supplementary alignment from each split and soft clip the bases that align elsewhere. This allows the bam to be more usable by other tools (like BQSR) since the logic to handle supplementary reads already exists. This means that we need an additional argument to HaplotypeCaller so that allows using supplementary alignments (See #2043). . My question is how can we document that SplitNCigarReads is not recommended for use with the changes to make the reads supplementary until #2043 is resolved? Is it possible to make the tool hidden in GATK4 or give it some tag that makes it clear it isn't ready for use yet?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1394#issuecomment-235062440:281,log,logic,281,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1394#issuecomment-235062440,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"@vdauwera The tools are categorized and listed in the Google Spreadsheet above. It is waiting for you to assign tech leads to tools for documentation. One thing that @chandrans brought to my attention is that for BaseRecalibrator one of the parameters (`-bqsr`) actually causes an error. One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?). Soooo, I think it may be prudent that those responsible for tool docs test the commands on data. - [4] Make sure the doc content enables Best Practices, e.g. plotting BQSR recalibration, and ; - [5] Test example commands to ensure they work. If they do not, make corrections and notate the change in application in the documentation.; - [6] Remember @vdauwera's plan to change the representation of parameters from camel to KEBAB case.

Testability,"@vruano The AF calculator is not where the alleles are removed. It calculates an honest probability that each exists. For example, if we have two alts and PLs are `(999,0,999,0,999,999)` -- that is, it's definitely a het, and we have no clue which alt allele it is, then it correctly says that the posterior probability of each alt allele is 0.5. Now, this probability of 0.5 is quite low for a real variant (below the default confidence threshold). `calculateOutputAlleleSubset` sees that and evaluates each allele independently, thus dropping both, but that's a consequence of relying on marginal probabilities. which this example suggests we ought not to do. The logic in `Mutect2` is different and avoids this issue. It does model comparison to see if we can remove alt alleles one at a time, starting with the alt allele with the worst marginal likelihood. Thus, it drops one alt allele, because there is only a tiny likelihood cost since the other alt allele can explain the data, but does not drop a second alt allele since then half the reads wouldn't fit.

For example, I think you can address (2) above (the location of the temporary theano directory) by either setting environment variables or modifying your Theano configuration (see http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/config.html) appropriately. You may also want to check the GermlineCNVCaller task in the WDL to see how other variables are set there. Let me look into whether you can also address (1) in this way, or if this will require a GATK code change, and get back to you. (Of course, if you figure it out before me, please follow up!)

Testability,"@yfarjoun for small arrays, `FastMath.log` is pretty much as fast as it gets. It is highly optimized. If you are dealing with giant arrays, however, an alternative is to cast the Java arrays into [NDArray](www.nd4j.org) and execute Nd4j native ops. Here's how the timings look:; ```N = 1, Apache = 0.001625 ms, Nd4j = 0.113038 ms; N = 10, Apache = 0.002112 ms, Nd4j = 0.029833 ms; N = 100, Apache = 0.011660 ms, Nd4j = 0.028464 ms; N = 1000, Apache = 0.049915 ms, Nd4j = 0.052455 ms; N = 10000, Apache = 0.348786 ms, Nd4j = 0.430606 ms; N = 100000, Apache = 3.572483 ms, Nd4j = 1.810641 ms; N = 10000000, Apache = 323.021844 ms, Nd4j = 175.421305 ms; ```; The nd4j times include the overhead of creating NDArrays and pulling back the results to JVM heap. The break even point is around N ~ 1000. If accuracy is not a concern, (1) a native implementation of log using half-precision floats or (2) caching, tabulation, and linear interpolation could help. ps> I just realized that the Nd4j call was using 4 threads. if you replace for loops in Java with parallel streams in Java with the same number of threads, Apache always beats Nd4j in this specific test:; ```N = 1, Apache = 0.073910 ms, Nd4j = 0.122488 ms; N = 10, Apache = 0.086508 ms, Nd4j = 0.056924 ms; N = 100, Apache = 0.067022 ms, Nd4j = 0.051674 ms; N = 1000, Apache = 0.081751 ms, Nd4j = 0.075098 ms; N = 10000, Apache = 0.202142 ms, Nd4j = 0.514030 ms; N = 100000, Apache = 1.190085 ms, Nd4j = 1.990945 ms; N = 10000000, Apache = 96.536308 ms, Nd4j = 210.331251 ms; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2577#issuecomment-292602609:38,log,log,38,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2577#issuecomment-292602609,3,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'test']"

Testability,"A few points:; 1. When we wrote the Java interface, the 'agreement' was that the sample names would be unique and consistent within the VCF headers. Hence, the assert statement in the Java code.; 1. Having said that, the sample name in the VCF header is ignored completely if checks are disabled (which are disabled by default). This includes the assert statement and a couple of other checks in the importer code. The sample name is taken from the name to reader map provided in the constructor call. This map is created from the tab delimited file.; 1. Would it be possible to provide a simple test case to replicate the bug? I couldn't replicate it. Here is what I did.; 1.

Testability,"A researcher is asking about the status of the ports for FindCoveredIntervals, DiagnoseTargets, and DepthOfCoverage at https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/12950/. In addition, they have some suggestions for features for DiagnoseTargets. I've recapitulated their post below:. ---. This is a GATK3 issue, but I hope that GATK4 will incorporate the following suggestion. And while we are on the subject, what is the roadmap for FindCoveredIntervals, DiagnoseTargets, and DepthOfCoverage (or something even more awesome) in GATK4?. A common pattern is to use `FindCoveredIntervals --uncovered` to create an interval list that serves as input to `DiagnoseTargets`. On a good day, FindCoveredIntervals --uncovered might create an interval list file that is empty, i.e., all the tested intervals were covered well enough by the given criteria. In this case DiagnoseTargets will first emit a warning like; ```; #WARN 18:11:43,557 IntervalUtils - The interval file /gpfs/share/cmoco_sys_dev/nfs/storage/cromwell/cromwell-executions/somatic_workflow/6a32b126-f616-42c5-9ec6-2994a4e4bd81/call-BamQCGatk/shard-4/bam_qc/2a4033e0-ea75-4d33-91ff-7ba7656536fe/call-FindUncoveredIntervals/shard-1/execution/VAL18-248-NT-D@VAL18-248-NT-D.08302018JH.Lymphoma.uncovered_intervals.interval_list contains no intervals that could be parsed.; ```; and then it raises an error like; ```; ###### ERROR MESSAGE: This tool only works if you provide one or more intervals (use the -L argument). If you want to run whole genome, use -T DepthOfCoverage instead.; ```; and exit with a non-zero return code. It is certainly possible to trap the empty interval list and skip DiagnoseTargets, but it I think it would be better if DiagnoseTargets emitted the warning but then quit with empty output and a zero rc. This would avoid the problem of a workflow that was developed with test data that always had some uncovered intervals suddenly failing when there is excellent coverage.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/19#issuecomment-426093222:790,test,tested,790,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/19#issuecomment-426093222,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful.

Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

No import done when this is used; - changed the existing tests to use multiple intervals instead of a single interval. @ldgauthier I'm not entirely sure about the picard interval_list generation.

Testability,"Adding a little more fuel to the fire on this one. Our workaround for this for the time being was going to be to run HC twice - once to output a gVCF and again to output a called VCF directly. While being a little wasteful of compute we figured this would give us correctly phased calls in a genotyped VCF while also giving us the reference confidence information in a gVCF. However, we just tried that and found that there is no phasing information in the genotyped VCF produced directly from HaplotypeCaller without any `-ERC` parameter. Looking at the logs i see:. ```; 09:00:09.140 INFO HaplotypeCallerEngine - Disabling physical phasing, which is supported only for reference-model confidence output; ```. Based on this I don't think there's a workaround. I can either generate a gVCF with `-ERC GVCF` or `-ERC BP_RESOLUTION`, but then running `GenotypeGVCFs` will mangle the phase information, _or_ run without `-ERC` but then get zero phasing information. Am I missing a potential workaround?

Looks like a two-sided p-value of sorts is calculated there—I think this is P_{2\alpha} from Wigginton, although I need to double check. EDIT: Yup, it is, and furthermore the implementation appears to be correct. Phew! Added one more test to guard against a possible overflow issue that came up with that implementation, although it doesn't appear we have the same issue here. Will also note that 1) tests for the htsjdk implementation are pretty slim and don't actually cover very much, and 2) I don't see why we need to have two copies of this implementation, when all that essentially differs is the choice of p-value returned---we could certainly consolidate and expose the option of which p-value to return. Finally, I will also note that there is an implementation in bcftools. I have not checked it for correctness, but it appears to allow the calculation of both the one-sided p-value intended by ExcessHet, as well as what Wigginton calls P_{HWE}.

Testability,"An alternate implementation, instead of wrapping RefApiSource and introducing a new interface, is to keep the RefApiSource API as the interface to use, so we only have one. . It's OK if the Spark methods throw NotImplemented on some calls that are not relevant to Spark. Then we can have RefApiSource be mostly empty, and we'd be using subclasses of it (or implementations, depending on whether we go the abstract class or interface route). . We still need some way to stub, because there are places deep in the code that call RefApiSource.getInstance(). We could have a getDataflowInstance() and a getSparkInstance() - the former would normally return the code formerly known as RefApiSource, except if tests set up the mock. getSparkInstance can return always the same thing apparently since you didn't see a need for a mock - but this way if we need it later, at least the code follows the same pattern.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086:469,stub,stub,469,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086,4,"['mock', 'stub', 'test']","['mock', 'stub', 'tests']"

Testability,"As determined by @davidadamsphd , the `Copyable` interface idea won't work:. The recommendation from the Dataflow team was to make a narrow API and do the copying part of the API. I started down this route, and I think it might be doable for things like the walker interface. The idea is to make a Copyable interface and have our interfaces extend that. . However, we have unsafe code already in the engine. I tried to make this SafeDoFn approach, however it became clear quickly that we'd have a combinatorial explosion of classes because we don't just have `DoFn<GATKRead,POut>`, but also `<Iterable<GATKRead>,POut>`, and many others. So, this approach will not work for the engine. I then tried to make a general purpose solution (using coders to write to bytes and then recreate a new class). This doesn't work for a few reasons, most critical is that the coder registry isn't Serializable, so that can't be passed down deep enough to get this to work. While working on this, I chatted with someone on the Dataflow team who is working on the verification on the direct runner. He has a PR out and likely going to get it approved soon. So, for the engine, we could always test using the direct runner and know for sure there are not issues (once we can use his code). However, there are two downsides:. 1) We will need to wait for a cut of the SDK (which looking at their previous clip is likely ~ two weeks away). . 2) I don't know if we want the direct runner test as our general purpose solution. Can we expect Comp Bios to always test with the direct runner first?

I decided to split this off into its own branch (just updated the existing branch https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/sl_sklearn_bgmm_port) and only include stubs for the BGMM backend in the above tools. This is so we can prioritize merging the IsolationForest implementation for @meganshand. We can easily add this module back when it's been reviewed separately. TODOs:. - [x] Class-level docs.; - [x] Method-level docs. I think pointers back to the original sklearn code will suffice for most methods, but I've also included some parameter descriptions. Also note that I've retained original sklearn comments throughout the implementation and have also commented on mathematical expressions where it might be helpful.; - [x] Unit tests. There's already test data (generated using Pyro) checked in and the results match the sklearn implementation to high precision, I just need to write numerical checks. There are also already unit tests for static utility methods. Future work:; - [ ] Expanding unit tests to cover more of the interface. These initial unit tests will almost certainly not completely cover the possibilities allowed by the interface, e.g. warm starts. Could be a good exercise for other developers. EDIT: At least one test of warm starts has been added.; - [ ] As mentioned in the prototyping discussion, expanding this implementation to properly include marginalization might be of future interest. However, I think a very strong case would have to made before proceeding, as I think closely matching the sklearn implementation has obvious benefits for maintainability.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948712:386,stub,stubs,386,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948712,7,"['stub', 'test']","['stubs', 'test', 'tests']"

They **should** degrade to java implementations automatically though. . IBM has a fork that works on power8 which reimplements some of the optimizations for PairHMM, so it's definitely possible to implement the various native optimizations for other architectures although not a small project. . GenomicsDB won't work since we only bundle libs for amd64/osx. You could in theory compile it yourself and pass the library on the library path. Other things that will need special attention would any of the library wrappers, for bwa-mem, fermlite, and hdf5. Those will similarly need custom builds supplied to the gatk. .

Testability,"By modifying the test I was able to isolate the error in the `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils` package, which is strange because the PR did not modify the javadoc for any class in that package. The integration test runs `com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute` and asserts that the output code is zero, which does not yield a useful error message.

Testability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum. I have a crude bash script that I can share if you want.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707:461,log,logs,461,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707,1,['log'],['logs']

Testability,"CollatingInterval does the equivalent of intern() without the overhead: It always returns the dictionary's copy of the contig name. (And it does this perforce. I think we're actually pretty inconsistent about interning.). I've tested sorting (which I would expect to be dominated by the cost of interval comparison) with 1) CollatingIntervals, and then, using the DictionaryOrderComparator, 2) SimpleIntervals with effectively interned contig Strings, and 3) SimpleIntervals with novel Strings. CollatingInterval is (disappointingly to me) only twice as fast with interned Strings, and three times as fast with novel Strings on my pathetically ancient Ubuntu machine. So is 2x and 3x ""a lot of time and effort""?. Seems to me like the potential issues with slightly different references are already a can of worms, and I don't see that this creates new worms.

Resolved as requested (or at least made efforts to):. * documenting the logic and methods; documented. * emit VCF instead of custom file format; emit both VCF custom file format now. * bug in determining if alignment signature satisfies `allMiddleAlignmentsDisjointFromAlphaOmega`; bug fixed in commit b4f7568b03b91eb77d256bcfe8117001bce040ec. --------. Unresolved yet:; the fact that gap split happens after the alignment configuration scoring step is considered backwards. I agree in principle but due to AS and MQ were used in the scoring step, and split-copy leads to technically wrong AS & MQ, I originally decided to score first, then split. Splitting the gapped alignments was introduced originally to have a centralized logic in inferring type and location of the events. . The tension is that AS is used in the scoring but becomes practically useless after that. >> Correct, but I am having thoughts about this now (not to pick only one—that; would be wrong—but to ditch them altogether probably under some condition; and redo the alignment step), exactly because of this behavior I observe.; Think about the case where one originating gapped (say insertion); alignment, after splitting, has one of the two children contained in; another alignment (not its sibling, that's impossible) in terms of their; read span. Now the originating gapped alignment probably should be filtered; out, or not, because if we keep it, an insertion would be called but; apparently there are alternative explanations due to the other alignment.; I'm not sure how to deal with this case, and if this scenario is common; enough.

Testability,"Copying in some discussion about my initial, incorrect, effort in PR #2547:. David Roazen:; As discussed in person, we fully support the mission of making this class less stateful (and particularly making it so that `isVcCoveredByDeletion()` does not modify state, which was the original ticket), but we're concerned that this method `calculateOutputAlleleSubset()` was intended to be stateful, and to accumulate deletions across calls. It's also not well covered by tests, so this change could easily break the method. Can you think about this issue and reply here once you've looked into it, davidbenjamin ? Also at-mentioning ronlevine to solicit his comments, since he appears to have added `upstreamDeletionsLoc` to this class in the first place. Ron Levine; droazen Is correct. It was intended to maintain state for upstream deletions. Make sure the upstream spanning deletion does not span shard barriers, then there will be problems with the book keeping. AFAIK, shards overlap genome locations but for a large spanning deletion, the size might not be sufficient. davidbenjamin Here is the motivation for the change: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1188 and accompanying pull request, [Removed spanning deletions if the deletion was removed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/pull/1417).

Testability,"Dear @davidbenjamin and @droazen,. please find [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/12196051/2023-06-21.ISMB.Poster.on.XOP.Variant.Calling.Workflow.and.Mutect2.SES.v3.pdf) the poster that we presented this Monday at ISMB 2023 in Lyon. It sheds some additional light on this issue and explains why we believe that fine-tuning of the error model introduced in Mutect2 4.1.9.0 led to overcalling of variants in samples with increased (but not pathologic) DNA degradation. Presentation of the poster led to several interesting discussions with other users of Mutect2 at the conference. Given these results, I would propose that you could expose the parameter you newly set in commit [a304725](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1) `private static final int ONE_THIRD_QUAL_CORRECTION = 5;` as a user-facing command line parameter. In this manner, you could leave the parameter at `5` by default but allow users who work on clinical (especially FFPE) samples to change it to `0` instead, thus effectively restoring the behaviour shown (and benchmarked) prior to 4.1.9.0. Would that be an acceptable compromise?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1655902557:1099,benchmark,benchmarked,1099,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1655902557,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarked']

Testability,"Did a quick test with sklearn's BayesianGaussianMixture, fitting 8 components to 2.5M 10D points generated from 4 isotropic blobs. On a Google Colab instance (which I believe are n1-highmem-2s), 150 iterations (which I think is the current maximum) completed in 14 minutes, with `%memit` reporting a memory peak of ~1.5GB. Note that convergence within the default tolerance isn't actually reached in 150 iterations for this toy data (as usual, it takes a while for the weights of unused components to shrink to zero). In any case, we'd have to compare against the number of iterations currently required to converge with the real data (and perhaps also check that the convergence criteria match up) to get a better idea of real runtime. Various tweaks to priors or other runtime options (such as k-means vs. random initialization) could also affect convergence speed. Minibatching isn't built in, but I think it should be pretty trivial to hack together something with the `warm_start` option; we could probably just do a warm start with a subset of the data.

As stated in the pull request https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6821, the change was evaluated with the DREAM3 benchmark and made sense at the time. To be fair, in the HCC1395 benchmark there is still a gain in recall (<2%, see the first figure in my original report above), which I assume to be mostly due to this commit, but the recall/precision tradeoff looks different now with the better benchmark callset.

Testability,"Downsampling doesn’t have to be to an exact level of coverage, it's just to avoid very high areas, so you might be able to do this on a Spark partition basis. Use mapPartitions to iterate through the reads in a partition, downsampling as you go (a bit like LocusIteratorByState does). If reads for a given alignment start cross a partition, then this would just mean you get up to 2C coverage at that point, where C is the target downsample coverage. This would solve the problem you outlined, without having to push the downsampling logic into Hadoop-BAM.

Testability,"Executive summary: . My main concern is that the amount of unsupported code is continuing to grow. Adding this PR would bring the total to about ~5k lines of WDL, Java, and test code. In comparison, the amount of corresponding supported CNV code clocks in around ~33k---this includes all of gCNV, as well! Development time has also been non-negligible and dates back to pre-4.0 release. Another concern is that the number of users of this unsupported code is also growing. In fact, it seems like we are actively pointing users to it. This seems unsustainable going forward. Finally, I don't think we have satisfactorily demonstrated which of the functions accomplished by this code (format conversion, post-hoc blacklisting, germline/""CNLOH"" tagging and imputation) are necessary or cannot be performed by existing code or more streamlined and principled methods. (Some of these functions, such as IGV conversion, are already performed by existing code.) Of those functions, I think format conversion is the only one we should retain from this code in an unsupported fashion. So if this PR introduces a useful GISTIC conversion, no harm in merging that. This all sounds like a decision for the new tech lead! @mwalker174 any thoughts? . More detailed responses follow:. > Users are already using this branch and giving me positive feedback (definitely more positive than adjusting num_changepoints_penalty_factor). I suggest merging mostly for practical reasons. It buys us more time to put in a principled solution. And this workflow is clearly marked as an unsupported prototype anyway (as are the GATK CLIs). I want to emphasize that this whole workflow is not a long-term solution. In other words, I would like to get this in and then focus on a supported solution. While it's great that users are giving positive feedback, I refer you to CellBender team's manifesto at https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/commit/28f02f8dbd716aff922bb8da1e56da29347b245b.

Testability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome). TODOs:; - [x] Integration tests. Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs.

Testability,"Finished refactoring the production code as detailed above, just need to add some tests. Results are exactly the same as before in single-sample mode---except for allele-fraction-only mode. This is because I refactored all existing segmenters (there were separate ones for copy-ratio-only, allele-fraction-only, and copy-ratio + allele-fraction) as special cases of a single multisample segmenter; however, the Gaussian kernel in the old allele-fraction-only segmenter was missing a normalization factor that is now present in the new multisample segmenter. Thus, users who previously ran in allele-fraction-only mode will have to retune parameters to achieve the same level of sensitivity. I expect that this will be a very small number of users (if any---note that allele-fraction-only mode isn't even exposed in the WDL), but we can probably mention it in the release notes.

Testability,"For a quick analysis, I made a serialized versions of DBSNP (13572728 variants from `dbsnp_135.b37.excluding_sites_after_129.vcf`), size of VCF on disk 2175071049 bytes (2.0G). (all false postive probs are predicted, it'd be easy to measure it too). Map keys are contig names. ```; Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.001 false positive prob = 27320529 bytes (26M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.0004 false positive prob = 30943001 bytes (30M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.0001 false positive prob = 36423625 bytes (35M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.00004 false positive prob = 40046089 bytes (38M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.00001 false positive prob = 45526681 bytes (43M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.000001 false positive prob = 54629745 bytes (52M); Map of String->int[] of positions = 60790452 bytes (58M); List<GATKVariant> made just like the one in spark BQSR = 366463957 bytes (349M); ```. Variants from dbSNP cover 0.004 of the genome (15195436 bases of 3101804739) so if we want reasonable precision (number of false positives over all reported hits), say 0.9 precision (of 10 hits only 1 can be false) we need (1-0.9) x 0.004 false positive prob = 0.0004. For 0.99 precision (of 100 hits only 1 can be false) we need (1-0.99) x 0.004 false postive prob = 0.00004. These are approximations of course. Given these numbers, I conclude that, for now, exploring BloomFilters does not seem to make sense (too little saving and too many complications with using a probabilistic data structure - eg we'd need to use it too for the walker BQSR). It does make sense however to explore alternatives to the list of GATKVariants because it's very big when serialized (maybe Kryo does a better job but it's still a big object). A simple alternative like sorted int[] may be sufficient and has attractive properties (trivial to implement and understand, O(log) lookups, 0% false positives, small size when serialized).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1407#issuecomment-203727133:1881,log,log,1881,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1407#issuecomment-203727133,1,['log'],['log']

Developers could have in their tools a field with the `WellFormedReadFilter` and call a new method for reporting the summary, to log a warning/debug line. For exploding depending on the tool, maybe an advance/hidden argument can be added to the filter (something like `--failOnMalformed`) to throw an exception if true; developers might add a default filter with this value equals to true if they want to enforce by default this behaviour.

Testability,"From what I have heard from Dmitriy, this loss in Mutect2 precision between Mutect2 v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0 seems to be perfectly reproducible using default parameters on the HCC1395 somatic benchmark gold-standard from the [Sequencing Quality Control Phase II Consortium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Somatic+Mutation+Working+Group+of+Sequencing+Quality+Control+Phase+II+Consortium%5BCorporate+Author%5D). The drop in performance seems to still persist in the current Mutect2 version. If true, then this could have dramatic affects on Mutect2 clinical variant calling quality since v.4.1.9.0 until now. It would appear that isolating the root cause of this drop in performance has high importance for maintaining the clinical validity of Mutect2. It seems quite a number of Mutect2 code details have [changed between v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0), as for instance [this commit concerning quality filtering](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1), or [this one concerning soft-clipped bases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/4982c2fa60e89f699a81150116d058aeac2f7573). Perhaps the circumstance of the drop in precision affecting WES but not WGS data may point to the culprit?.

Testability,GATK tests are now running as well. They may need additional work on robustness. Initial versions were failing to checkout the correct htsjdk version and silently passing on master.

Testability,"GCS NIO provider is public already, accessible at:; https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/tree/gcs-nio.

The integration tests pass, showing it's now possible to read/write GCS files via the NIO interface.

Testability,"GVCF` mode in HaplotypeCaller we merge adjacent regions with similar `GQ` scores but within those merged reference blocks we track the DP (mean dp) and the MIN_DP. When we go to genotype in GenotypeGVCFs we fall back to Min_DP when reporting the DP since it must be at least that high at the sight in question. For Diploid samples and with the default reference blocking we use, this works fine and for most of the range up to 30+ bases you are able to recover a pretty close approximation of what your DP is in most cases. However for Haploid data the assumptions at play mean that the `GQ` gets very high and starts to max out the field (99) so you end up with extremely long reference confidence blocks with very high confidence and a min_DP of some low value (in your case for the data you shared with us of 4, which is the threshold for hitting GQ=90 in the haploid model). This is also part of why adjusting the intervals for traversal was relevant, as if they were too long they were pulling in bases 1000+ bp away that only have 4fold coverage with reads and torpedoing the reported DP. So far nothing seems to obviously be bugged (we don't test/use haploid calling mode very often so its less well tested and this sort of issue is not surprising). We might be over-confident about reporting `GQ` for haploid reference blocks (though mathematically its sound that you only need a few reference observations to be sure about the ref call). Short of adjusting that model drastically there will always be some threshold where ""after X fold coverage of reads everything is merged into a big adjacent ref block"". Unfortunately with block merging on we never expect the DP to be exact (since it should vary over the block and its expensive to store that information exactly) but the issue is much more pronounced in your haploid sample. . We didn't identify a good fix for this issue on our end but you might as well know that we looked into it and have considered why you are seeing this behavior.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8943#issuecomment-2318660429:1318,test,test,1318,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8943#issuecomment-2318660429,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"GenomicsDB loads now, and I can run the tests. The MIN_DP issue is happening because the BCF codec creates the VariantContext with an Integer value for the attribute since it has the type descriptor at hand, whereas the VCF codec just creates it as a String (it doesn't consult the header, which I might call a bug). The comparator doesn't compare these correctly, and ironically, its the string that gets converted to a double. There also seem to be other problematic type differences between the VCs created from BCF vs. VCF. I need to do think a bit about how to properly fix this; I'm not sure just making the comparator more tolerant of these differences is a good idea, since it could wind up masking real problems.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2389#issuecomment-294962429:40,test,tests,40,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2389#issuecomment-294962429,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,God that method is so much worse than i thought... We resort to hard coding common side outputs that are likely to show up and mark them for deletion in case we happen to produce one of them... I wonder if it is indeed possible to flag a directory for deletion and if we cant improve that method by secretly putting the file you ask for into a delete-on-exit folder so we don't have to guess about indexes and side outputs (that frankly don't look complete? What if my test has a tmp-fast dict/index those aren't included in the list of side outputs to flag for deletion).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864:469,test,test,469,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Hello,. GenomicsDB developer here - I'm not super familiar with SLURM...can you tell if your job was actually terminated or was that just a warning of sorts? Can you use `saact` command to find the memory usage of the job? Do your logs tell you how many batches have made progress before you see the error above?. Also, is this difference intentional or...?; > #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=**100G**; vs; > --java-options ""-Xmx190g -**Xms190g**"". Lastly, you could try reducing the batch size down (let's say something like 10, just to see if it makes the error go away) or splitting up into smaller intervals than chromosomes (say, split into intervals of size 50 million) and see if that makes a difference. The idea with each of these is to lower memory usage. Edit: One more thing @nalinigans reminded me of - you could potentially be allocating too much for java here. Again, not super familiar with SLURM so not sure how much this job is getting overall vs how much is being given to Java. GenomicsDB has a core C++ component that does a lot of heavy lifting for us. If you've allocated all/most of the memory available to the job to Java, then the C++ side might be getting starved or causing the job to go over limits. Try reducing what you've set for `--java-options` to make sure there is some memory left for the C++ parts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913:231,log,logs,231,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913,1,['log'],['logs']
Testability,"Hello,. I think we're pretty close on porting this. However, i wanted to ask again if I could get access to the test data used in GATK3 VariantEvalWalkerUnitTest and VariantEvalIntegrationTest. We dont need to port those files to GATK4 unless some of them already exist; however, having these files would help confirm the ported tool is behaving exactly as GATK3. Second, I am hoping to confirm a behavior for FeaureContext: many GATK3 stratifiers follow roughly this pattern (VariantEval / knownCNVsFile being an example). The pattern is: 1) some VCF/BED file provided as an argument, 2) in initialize(), the walker reads this file in memory into a List<GenomeLoc> or IntervalTree<GenomeLoc>. This is so each locus can quickly find overlapping intervals. In GATK4, there is no longer a point in loading the whole file into memory, right? If I define an argument as FeatureInput<Feature>, it will automatically be initialized. FeatureContext.getValues() seems to give me overlapping intervals (including partial overlaps). Therefore there is no reason to try to replicate that GATK3 pattern of reading intervals into memory. Can someone confirm this is correct?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-343563884:112,test,test,112,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-343563884,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Here's a prototype showing one way of doing this: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/3cf7f9078b6aedcb87a4ca77c2aa8e84e7e5fe99. The idea is that `GATKTool` has a `-spark` flag, so you can run a tool in Spark mode. The parallel `GATKSparkTool` hierarchy would disappear, and tool writers would optionally be able to support Spark as an alternative to the regular walker, by providing the relevant code in the same tool class. As an example, the `FlagStat` implementation looks like this:. ``` java; @Override; public void traverse() {; if (sparkArgs.useSpark) {; sum = getReadsRdd().aggregate(new FlagStatus(), FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; } else {; sum = getReadsStream().collect(FlagStatus::new, FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; }; }; ```. Note that the walker version uses the Java 8 Streams API, while the Spark version uses the RDD API. While these are different APIs, many of the concepts are similar, so it should be possible to share the underlying logic by encapsulating it in classes, in much the same way as is done by the `FlagStatus` class for `FlagStat`. It would also be possible to keep the existing `apply` method for walker versions of tools that simply iterate over each record. Removing the parallel `GATKSparkTool` hierarchy has a number of benefits, such as reducing duplication, making it easier for tool writers to add Spark support, and making it easier to share tests.

Testability,"Here's the work I've done so far to implement an overlaps partitioner: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/tw_overlap_partitioner. The idea is to coalesce neighbouring partitions so that the task processing them can see (but not process) reads from neighbouring partitions. E.g. the task processing partition _i_ can see reads from partition _i-1_ and partition _i+1_. This is done using Spark 2's _coalesce_ method that takes a PartitionCoalescer: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#coalesce(int,%20boolean,%20scala.Option,%20scala.math.Ordering). In this PR I backported some of that logic so it works with Spark 1.6. It turns out that this is not faster than the groupByKey, primarily since it has to scan over the input twice: first to find the extents of the reads in each partition, second to process each (coalesced) partition. It should be possible to avoid the first scan by just reading the first read in each partition and using a sequence dictionary to find the end points of contigs. This is a bit more involved, although it should be faster than groupByKey. (I tried caching the input to see if this helped, but it didn't.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1988#issuecomment-241773735:637,log,logic,637,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1988#issuecomment-241773735,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"Hey @davidbenjamin,. just a heads-up that we have generated some additional inights on this issue that relate to the effects of sample prep on false-positive rates under the changed error model. In short, it seems as if the error model is now much more (perhaps overly?) sensitive to sample-prep noise typical in real-world clinical sequencing data, leading to a 2-3x increase of false-positives in such WES (and, assuming, also other high-coverage) samples.

Testability,"Hey @jean-philippe-martin, this looks good. I've made some very small changes to avoid the back-and-forth of a review, and rebased the branch onto latest master. . The main change I made was in `IOUtils.getPath()`. It now traps the `IOException` and throws a `UserException` instead. This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not).

Testability,"Hi @LiviaMoura ,. The dropped allele is expected behavior. One of the ways reblocking speeds up joint genotyping is by dropping information associated with alleles that are not in the most likely genotype. The subsequent alleles are not left aligned because the position doesn't change. Instead they are trimmed so that they use the minimal representation. Historically the FORMAT DP doesn't change when alleles are dropped (as in subsetting more than 5 alternate alleles in the previous pipeline). Given that this is a GVCF with a <NON_REF> allele, the most correct thing to do would be to move that 1 read associated with the dropped allele to the <NON_REF> AD so that the sum of the AD values are still equal to the FORMAT DP, but the NON-REF AD values will get dropped in the joint genotyping step anyway, so the change would only be reflected in the intermediate GVCF files. The DRAGEN data I had been working with didn't have allele fraction, but we also came across this issue independently. I made a fix and we're testing it now. If it looks good, I'll generalize it to use the header information rather than special casing particular annotations. I can put in some code to subset the posteriors as well.

Testability,"Hi @Neato-Nick @davidbenjamin . Apologies for posting this message here. I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs. I would appreciate if you could provide any feedback on this issue and/or if this behaviour has been observed by some other users also.

Testability,Hi @RWilton i'm sorry to hear that. I suspect its unrelated given how simple this PR is but its quite possible that filter has been broken since evidently nobody was able to use and adjust it for a long time. This is the logic here that the filter uses:; `return read.isPaired() && !read.isUnmapped() && !read.mateIsUnmapped() &&; (Math.abs(read.getStart() - read.getMateStart()) >= mateTooDistantLength || !read.getContig().equals(read.getMateContig()));`. That logic is correct for what the filter is doing. It should be noted that the filter does the opposite of what you expect it to (since its intended for our SV pipeline) in that it filters out all reads that are NOT having distant mates. This means if you try to run HaplotypeCaller with this setting you will be throwing away every read pair EXCEPT the distant ones which results in mostly no reads. We should perhaps rename this filter to be a little less confusing.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098:221,log,logic,221,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098,2,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Hi @geetduggal. Thanks for the very complete error report! I'm sorry you're running into these errors. We're aware of similar problems and fixing them is a very high priority. It looks like you're running use the tagged alpha version. I might try using the most version. Pull request #1433 should hopefully fix the problem your seeing in your third example, which I believe is likely caused by the same issue as in #1324.

( 98f01b0 or newer). . The second case of producing an empty bam file is a worrying one, and not one I've seen before. I can reproduce it locally. ```; ./gatk-launch MarkDuplicatesSpark -I src/test/resources/large/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.NA12878.20.21.bam -O test.standalone.bam -- --sparkRunner SPARK --sparkMaster spark://wm1b0-8ab:7077; ```. results in a bam with only the header.

Testability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that.

Testability,Hi @lucifer9288. Thanks for pointing this out as its a very confusing message. Its an oversight in our logging that causes that error message and it should not mean that your execution of SplitNCigarReads was invalid. The inflater in this message is referring to the fact that one of the compressed blocks gets uncompressed with zero output bytes which happens with the very last block of a properly formatted BGZF file (as a your input bam should be). It looks like the issue is an errant message in the GKL intel inflater.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080:103,log,logging,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080,1,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"Hi @magicDGS. I went down this same path (composition of CountingFilter) when I originally implemented CountingReadFilter, but I abandoned it for the model we currently have. I think the current model is much simpler in a number of ways. This is an interesting problem, but I would say lets just implement a straight CountingVariantFilter/tests and not try to do the common implementation. . BTW, when looking at this PR I noticed two bugs in the existing code that we should make sure not to propagate to the Variant one (feel free to fix/test these as part of this PR):. - CountingReadFilter.resetFilterCount only resets the root filter count; it needs an override in BinOp to propagate the reset call to the lhs/rhs operands.; - there is a bug in the getSummary tests/code; you can see the fix [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/9ef1458271834aed9b64a5d66f94df33f025eafb).

Testability,"Hi @stefandiederich,. Great that you were able to successfully run GermlineCNVCaller! @asmirnov239 is currently working on a postprocessing tool that will convert the raw generated results into VCFs. @mbabadi is also working on writing some more in-depth documentation on the tool and its probabilistic model. For now, you may be able to parse the raw results on your own. You are probably most interested in the contents of the ""*-calls"" directory. The root of this directory contains the interval list common to all samples; furthermore, each sample has its own subdirectory that contains text files that describe the sample-specific model-parameter posteriors. In particular, the ""log_q_c_tc.tsv"" file contains the log posteriors per copy-number state, with rows corresponding to the intervals in the aforementioned interval list.

Testability,"Hi @tomwhite! The serializer registrations in ADAM shouldn't effect any GATK serialization, unless you're serializing classes from ADAM (such as `org.bdgenomics.format.avro.AlignmentRecord`); additionally, we haven't seen any performance issues with serialization in ADAM 0.23.0 outside of the GATK. We actually made a number of patches to eliminate logging in 0.23.0 (relative to 0.22.0), so I'd doubt that is the culprit. The one exception to this is logging when writing Parquet out to disk, which greatly increased sometime between ADAM 0.21.0 and 0.23.0, due to a change in Parquet versions upstream in Spark. However, this would only impact you if you were writing Parquet, and additionally this issue was resolved with the release of Spark 2.2.0, so you should see the logging go away with #4314. If I had to hypothesize anything, I'd suggest that the 2bit file change is the one thing that could be biting you. That said, we've been running with this 2bit file code quite frequently on AWS and Azure for at least the last 6 months using GATK HC on WES and WGS data and haven't seen any performance issues. I show that the changes in the 2bit file code between ADAM 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 are API compatible, so if you check out ADAM 0.23.0 and then `git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.11-0.20.0 adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/util/TwoBitFile.scala` and build the ADAM JAR (and then package that jar into GATK), you should be able to test that hypothesis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897:350,log,logging,350,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897,4,"['log', 'test']","['logging', 'test']"

Testability,"Hi Adam,. Thank you for this amazing work, and would like to suggest something small without disturbing the test-flow. So unless I'm not mistaken, the class that is consuming the memory is [NestedIntegerArray.java](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/master/public/gatk-utils/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/utils/collections/NestedIntegerArray.java). Why not try an experiment where you implement something similar to [Google's SSTable](https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/) that got release as [leveldb](https://github.com/google/leveldb). For instance the key-index lookup for you can be hash or a hash+offset. Basically these structures borrow from the concept of a [Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) - link is a PDF paper](http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/18e91eb4db2114a06ea614f0384f2784.pdf). You can push most of these to disk instead of memory, and they can be compressed as well. The indices can remain in memory for fast-lookup with the data staying on disk. So for instance, you can generate an key-index digest of specific values via `hash_function(numReadGroups.id, qualDimension.index, eventDimension.type)`, whose result you then use to quickly lookup the value for that key - which would reside on disk. That can be further improved with a priority queue cache for the most accessed values.

Testability,"Hi Marissa - I think we're all in agreement that we'd like to find a way to make Intel-TF the default, but whether or not we can have CNNScoreVariants require AVX to run is less clear. Naturally, we'd prefer to not have to provide a custom TF distribution for a fallback, but there are 3 cases where we may not have a choice: user with old hardware, Travis/CI testing, and GCE. We may need to provide a fallback environment for those (I'll try to get resolution on that). If it turns out we do, I'm actually not suggesting the fallback be automatic (3 in your list), just that we have a graceful failure mode and an instructive error message. . In the meantime, there is still the issue that this PR fails to even build on Travis. It looks like it produces so much output building the Docker image that it exceeds the allowable Travis build log size.

Testability,"Hi [cademirch](https://github.com/cademirch),. I believe the tool is working as intended in this case. The tool in this mode is designed to balance interval lists evenly by the amount of genomic territory covered, without splitting any individual interval. The documentation for `BALANCING_WITHOUT_INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION` mode mentions this:. ""Scatter the interval list into similarly sized interval lists (**_by base count_**), but without breaking up intervals."". Since the tool is not allowed to split individual intervals in this mode, it may use the number of bases in the largest interval (`test:160-220` in your toy example) as the target number of bases per file:. ""The ""target width"" of each scatter list may be wider than what is computed for INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION. Specifically, if the widest interval in the source interval list is larger than what would otherwise be the target width, that interval's width is used."". This likely explains why you're only getting 3 files -- the tool is trying to ensure that each file covers ~60 bases.

Testability,"Hi again, some updates! I've updated our PED with inferred rather than stated sex, which has resolved a number of these issues. As stated before, the samples which had incorrectly assigned sexes were not the named samples appearing the error logs, which made troubleshooting a challenge. .

Testability,Hi all -- I have recently started observing this exact issue with PrintReads. I have been using this via cromwell jobs in Terra and on Saturday this issue cropped up. I was able to recreate it locally by launching the latest GATK Docker image (4.2.5.0) and running `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`. Similar to @ldgauthier adding `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=` does nothing locally. Did this ever get resolved? Let me know if I'm missing something here.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6179#issuecomment-1046993824:278,log,login,278,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6179#issuecomment-1046993824,2,['log'],['login']
Testability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:1226,test,test,1226,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,1,['test'],['test']

Subsetting the BAM file to within 100 bases of the call with the missing alt results in files that cannot reproduce this behavior, it needs to be a larger window.; 2.

Testability,"Hi, regarding making --linked-de-bruijn-graph the default, I wanted to share that I had recently run mutect2 (gatkv4.2.6.1) on a larger cohort of samples with that option, some of which had variant calls from a previous mutect2 run (gatkv4.1.0.0) without this option. I noticed that plenty of known cancer drivers (e.g. KRAS p.G12C or PIK3CA p.E545* or BRAF p.V600*) that were present in a substantial number of samples (>10%ish) in the old calls were completely absent in the new calls. I had to add the option --recover-all-dangling-branches to recover those known hotspot mutations. They also all have very sufficient coverage (O(100)x) and high VAF to make them obvious true positives. I'd expect from mutect2 to be always able to call presence or absence of known hotspot mutations, so you should either look into further testing/debugging the linked de Bruijn graph option or also make it a default to recover all dangling branches.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7809#issuecomment-1125355262:827,test,testing,827,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7809#issuecomment-1125355262,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Hmm, thanks for suggesting the addition of a regression test @fleharty. This caused me to realize that I actually missed another gap in the previous filtering logic that might have yielded NaNs (resulting from division by zero interval medians) in this particular edge case, which actually takes effect before the rounding error I originally fixed. However, because of how HDF5 writes NaN values as 0, this apparently doesn't lead to any catastrophic failures. We should definitely check that behavior is reasonable in this case (i.e., when interval medians are zero); I've filed #6878. In the end, I added a regression test that only passes with the changes to address the rounding error. This was a bit of a pain because we use simulated data in the tests that cover this code, and the filters are applied in sequential order only on those elements that passed the previous filter. Note that there are many other possible filtering combinations that would be impractical to test. I think that all of this filtering logic was ported over from GATK CNV (I only rewrote the code to perform the filtering in-place to improve memory usage), and I'm not sure that all edge-case behavior was well defined by the original logic (which probably implicitly assumed typical, well formed data, i.e., using more than one sample, without too many uncovered intervals). Fortunately, these edge-case usages (i.e., using a single sample to build the PoN, mistakenly including too many uncovered intervals, and/or disabling various filters) are probably not too common.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882:56,test,test,56,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test', 'tests']"

I would check your file handle limits and see if there's either a very low user limit or a low system limit. It's possible another user on the same system is consuming a lot of file handles. Is it consistently happening? What version of gatk are you using?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5316#issuecomment-598224260:91,test,tested,91,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5316#issuecomment-598224260,1,['test'],['tested']
Testability,How do you confirm the tests are actually using the intel deflator? Can we add a test on travis that checks that it's using it? . It would be good if we could specify these in 1 place and have them applied everywhere they need to be. Looks :+1: to me though modulo possible test to verify that right deflator is being used.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1630#issuecomment-201327822:23,test,tests,23,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1630#issuecomment-201327822,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
