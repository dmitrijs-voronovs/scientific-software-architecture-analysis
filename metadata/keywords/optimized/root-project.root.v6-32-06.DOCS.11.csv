Integrability,"itors Control. Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing; virtual method void `TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass` `*cl)`.; It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default; implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing; mechanism. To prevent inclusion of a base-class into the compound editor, call:. ``` {.cpp}; void TGedEditor::ExcludeClassEditor(TClass* class, Bool_t recurse); ```. Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in **`TGedFrame`**‘s; data-member:. ``` {.cpp}; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; ```. Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in; the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of; **`TGedFrame`**'s data member `Int_t fPriority`. The default value is; 50; smaller values move the frame towards to the top. This priority; should be set in the editor constructor. ## Drag and Drop. Drag and Drop support is introduced for Linux (via Xdnd - the drag and; drop protocol for X window system) and for Windows (via Clipboard).; Users can selects something in ROOT with a mouse press, drags it (moves; the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed) and releases the mouse; button someplace else. When the button is released the selected data is; ""dropped"" at that location. This way, a histogram from an opened ROOT; file in the browser can be dragged to any **`TCanvas`**. ![](pictures/03000223.png). A script file from the browser can be dropped to a **`TGTextView`** or; TGTextEdit widget in **`TGTextEditor`**. On Linux, it is possible to drag objects between ROOT and an external; application. For example to drag a macro file from the ROOT browser to; the Kate editor. On Windows, drag and drop works only within a single; ROOT application (for the time being), but works also from Windows; Explorer to **`TCanvas`** ot to **`TGTextEdit`**. ### Drag and Drop Data Class.

Integrability,"ity Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport.

The interval to search for the minimum (the default is the `TF1` range), tolerance and maximum iterations can be provided as optional parameters of the; `TF1::GetMinimum/Maximum` functions. ### Multi-Dimensional Minimization. All the algorithms for multi-dimensional minimization are implementing the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer`; interface and they can be used in the same way and one can switch between minimizer at run-time.; The minimizer concrete class can be in d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:65702,interface,interface,65702,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"jects as input and; returns MustAlias, PartialAlias, MayAlias, or NoAlias as appropriate. Like all ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces, the ``alias`` method requires that either; the two pointer values be defined within the same function, or at least one of; the values is a :ref:`constant <constants>`. .. _Must, May, or No:. Must, May, and No Alias Responses; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``NoAlias`` response may be used when there is never an immediate dependence; between any memory reference *based* on one pointer and any memory reference; *based* the other. The most obvious example is when the two pointers point to; non-overlapping memory ranges. Another is when the two pointers are only ever; used for reading memory. Another is when the memory is freed and reallocated; between accesses through one pointer and accesses through the other --- in this; case, there is a dependence, but it's mediated by the free and reallocation. As an exception to this is with the :ref:`noalias <noalias>` keyword;; the ""irrelevant"" dependencies are ignored. The ``MayAlias`` response is used whenever the two pointers might refer to the; same object. The ``PartialAlias`` response is used when the two memory objects are known to; be overlapping in some way, regardless whether they start at the same address; or not. The ``MustAlias`` response may only be returned if the two memory objects are; guaranteed to always start at exactly the same location. A ``MustAlias``; response does not imply that the pointers compare equal. The ``getModRefInfo`` methods; -----------------------------. The ``getModRefInfo`` methods return information about whether the execution of; an instruction can read or modify a memory location. Mod/Ref information is; always conservative: if an instruction **might** read or write a location,; ``ModRef`` is returned. The ``AliasAnalysis`` class also provides a ``getModRefInfo`` method for testing; dependencies between function calls. This method takes two call sites ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst:5451,depend,dependencies,5451,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

However, during the import we could import C and D without any error and they; are independent of A,B and E. We must not set up an error for C and D.

Let's consider this; AST:. .. code-block:: text. A->B->C->A; `->E.

This attribute; overrides ``no_sanitize(""thread"")``. Ignorelist; ----------. ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports; in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with; ``no_sanitize(""thread"")`` attribute, ignored functions are not instrumented; at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed synchronization via; atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports. Limitations; -----------. * ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default; settings the memory overhead is 5x plus 1Mb per each thread. Settings with 3x; (less accurate analysis) and 9x (more accurate analysis) overhead are also; available.; * ThreadSanitizer maps (but does not reserve) a lot of virtual address space.; This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as usually expected.; * Libc/libstdc++ static linking is not supported.; * Non-position-independent executables are not supported. Therefore, the; ``fsanitize=thread`` flag will cause Clang to act as though the ``-fPIE``; flag had been supplied if compiling without ``-fPIC``, and as though the; ``-pie`` flag had been supplied if linking an executable. Current Status; --------------. ThreadSanitizer is in beta stage. It is known to work on large C++ programs; using pthreads, but we do not promise anything (yet). C++11 threading is; supported with llvm libc++. The test suite is integrated into CMake build; and can be run with ``make check-tsan`` command.

Here is an example using the `zlib`_ library, which is likely available on; your system:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('zlib.h') # bring in C++ definitions; >>> cppyy.load_library('libz') # load linker symbols; >>> cppyy.gbl.zlibVersion() # use a zlib API; '1.2.11'; >>>. Since header files can include other header files, it is easy to aggregate; all relevant ones into a single header to include.; If there are project-specific include paths, you can add those paths through; ``cppyy.add_include_path``.; If a header is C-only and not set for use with C++, use ``cppyy.c_include``,; which adds ``extern ""C""`` around the header. Library files can be aggregated by linking all relevant ones to a single; library to load.; Using the linker for this purpose allows regular system features such as; ``rpath`` and envars such as ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to be applied as usual.; Note that any mechanism that exposes the library symbols will work.; For example, you could also use the standard module ``ctypes`` through; ``ctypes.CDLL`` with the ``ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL`` option. To explore, start from ``cppyy.gbl`` to access your namespaces, classes,; functions, etc., etc. directly; or use python's ``dir`` (or tab-completion); to see what is available.; Use python's ``help`` to see list the methods and data members of classes and; see the interfaces of functions.

We have just established a connection and you just saw how to send and; receive a string with the example ""go"". Now let's send a histogram. *To send an object (in our case on the client side*) it has to derive; from **`TObject`** class because it uses the `Streamers` to fill a; buffer that is then sent over the connection. On the receiving side, the; `Streamers` are used to read the object from the message sent via the; socket. For network communication, we have a specialized **`TBuffer`**,; a descendant of **`TBuffer`** called **`TMessage`**. In the following; example, we create a **`TMessage`** with the intention to store an; object, hence the constant `kMESS_OBJECT` in the constructor. We create; and fill the histogram and write it into the message. Then we call; **`TSocket`**`::Send` to send the message with the histogram. ``` {.cpp}; ...; // create an object to be sent; TH1F *hpx = new TH1F(""hpx"",""px distribution"",100,-4,4);; hpx->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);. // create a TMessage to send the object; TMessage message(kMESS_OBJECT);. // write the histogram into the message buffer; message.WriteObject(hpx);. // send the message; socket->Send(message);; ...; ```. On the receiving end (in our case the server side), we write a while; loop to wait and receive a message with a histogram. Once we have a; message, we call `TMessage::ReadObject`, which returns a pointer to; **`TObject`**. We have to cast it to a **`TH1`** pointer, and now we; have a histogram. At the end of the loop, the message is deleted, and; another one is created at the beginning. ``` {.cpp}; while (1) {; TMessage *message;; socket->Recv(message);; TH1 *h = (TH1*)message->ReadObject(message->GetClass());; delete message;; }; ```. ## Closing the Connection.

Generally, if the new object that; needs to be created does not depend on other objects, it will be built; with a set of default parameters. This is the case for all shapes; (except composite shapes) and matrices. For all the other objects the; interface forces the selection of components before creating the object. ### Editing Volumes. Volumes are hierarchical components in the geometry, therefore their; editor is more complex. It provides the following functionalities:. - *General*. This category allows changing the name of the volume and; selecting other shape or medium among existing ones. - *Daughters*. The category allows removing existing daughter nodes or; adding new ones.

One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

One; such an example is given in Figure 3.3. ![With noisy data the number of peaks can be enormous](figures/image062.png). Therefore it can be useful to have a possibility to set a threshold value and to consider only the peaks higher than this threshold (see Figure 3.4, only three peaks were identified, threshold=50). The value in the center of the peak (`value[i]`) minus the average value in two symmetrically positioned channels (channels `i-3*sigma`, `i+3*sigma`) must be greater than threshold.; Otherwise the peak is ignored. ![Iwth threshold=50, only three peaks were identified](figures/image064.png). An alternative approach was proposed in [6]. The algorithm generates; new invariant spectrum based on discrete Markov chains. In this spectrum; the noise is suppressed, the spectrum is smoother than the original one.; On the other hand it emphasizes peaks (depending on the averaging; window). The example of the part of original noisy spectrum and Markov; spectrum for `window=3` is given in Figure 3.5 Then the peaks can be found in; Markov spectrum using standard above-presented algorithm. ![Part of original noisy spectrum and Markov spectrum for window=3](figures/image066.png).

Integrability,"l"" via the :ref:`datalayout string<langref_datalayout>`.; Non-integral pointer types represent pointers that have an *unspecified* bitwise; representation; that is, the integral representation may be target dependent or; unstable (not backed by a fixed integer). ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` instructions have the same semantics as for; integral (i.e. normal) pointers in that they convert integers to and from; corresponding pointer types, but there are additional implications to be; aware of. Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:.

Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow.

A module could have multiple module implementation; units with the same declaration. A module interface partition unit is a module unit whose module declaration is; ``export module module_name:partition_name;``. The ``partition_name`` should be; unique within any given module. An internal module partition unit is a module unit whose module declaration; is ``module module_name:partition_name;``. The ``partition_name`` should be; unique within any given module.

The majority of the ORCv1 layers and utilities were renamed with a 'Legacy'; prefix in LLVM 8.0, and have deprecation warnings attached in LLVM 9.0. In LLVM; 12.0 ORCv1 will be removed entirely. Transitioning from ORCv1 to ORCv2 should be easy for most clients. Most of the; ORCv1 layers and utilities have ORCv2 counterparts [2]_ that can be directly; substituted. However there are some design differences between ORCv1 and ORCv2; to be aware of:. 1. ORCv2 fully adopts the JIT-as-linker model that began with MCJIT. Modules; (and other program representations, e.g. Object Files) are no longer added; directly to JIT classes or layers. Instead, they are added to ``JITDylib``; instances *by* layers.

A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime.

The simple reason for; this comes from before the monorepo, and both [sub]projects need to; demangle symbols, but neither can depend on each other. * libcxxabi needs the demangler to implement __cxa_demangle, which is; part of the itanium ABI spec. * LLVM needs a copy for a bunch of places, and cannot rely on the; system's __cxa_demangle because it a) might not be available (i.e.,; on Windows), and b) may not be up-to-date on the latest language; features. The copy of the demangler in LLVM has some extra stuff that aren't; needed in libcxxabi (ie, the MSVC demangler, ItaniumPartialDemangler),; which depend on the shared generic components. Despite these; differences, we want to keep the ""core"" generic demangling library; identical between both copies to simplify development and testing. If you're working on the generic library, then do the work first in; libcxxabi, then run libcxxabi/src/demangle/cp-to-llvm.sh. This; script takes as an optional argument the path to llvm, and copies the; changes you made to libcxxabi over. Note that this script just; blindly overwrites all changes to the generic library in llvm, so be; careful. Because the core demangler needs to work in libcxxabi, everything; needs to be declared in an anonymous namespace (see; DEMANGLE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN), and you can't introduce any code that; depends on the libcxx dylib. FIXME: Now that LLVM is a monorepo, it should be possible to; de-duplicate this code, and have both LLVM and libcxxabi depend on a; shared demangler library. Testing; -------. The tests are split up between libcxxabi/test/{unit,}test_demangle.cpp, and; llvm/unittest/Demangle. The llvm directory should only get tests for stuff not; included in the core library. In the future though, we should probably move all; the tests to LLVM.

To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------.

Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result).

The pseudo-code for the; lookup process is:. .. code-block:: none. construct a query object from a query set and query handler; lock the session; lodge query against requested symbols, collect required materializers (if any); unlock the session; dispatch materializers (if any).

The metadata encoding as lists of lists of options, as opposed to a collapsed; list of options, is chosen so that the IR encoding can use multiple option; strings to specify e.g., a single library, while still having that specifier be; preserved as an atomic element that can be recognized by a target specific; assembly writer or object file emitter. Each individual option is required to be either a valid option for the target's; linker, or an option that is reserved by the target specific assembly writer or; object file emitter. No other aspect of these options is defined by the IR. Dependent Libs Named Metadata; =============================. Some targets support embedding of strings into object files to indicate; a set of libraries to add to the link. Typically this is used in conjunction; with language extensions which allow source files to explicitly declare the; libraries they depend on, and have these automatically be transmitted to the; linker via object files. The list is encoded in the IR using named metadata with the name; ``!llvm.dependent-libraries``. Each operand is expected to be a metadata node; which should contain a single string operand. For example, the following metadata section contains two library specifiers::. !0 = !{!""a library specifier""}; !1 = !{!""another library specifier""}; !llvm.dependent-libraries = !{ !0, !1 }.

Integrability,"licit; conversion, a second round is tried where implicit conversion, including; instantiation of temporaries, is allowed.; The implicit creation of temporaries, although convenient, can be costly in; terms of run-time performance. During some template calls, implicit conversion is not allowed, giving; preference to new instantiations (as is the case in C++).; If, however, a previously instantiated overload is available and would match; with promotion, it is preferred over a (costly) new instantiation, unless a; template overload is explicitly selected using template arguments.; For example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppdef(r""""""\; ... template<typename T>; ...

If it is important that a specific overload is selected, then use the; ``__overload__`` method to match a specific function signature.; An optional boolean second parameter can be used to restrict the selected; method to be const (if ``True``) or non-const (if ``False``).; The return value of which is a first-class callable object, that can be; stored to by-pass the overload resolution:. .. code-block:: python. >>> gf_double = global_function.__overload__('double'); >>> gf_double(1) # int i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst:8399,depend,depend,8399,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

(If you are writing a backend for an; architecture which cannot satisfy these restrictions and cares about; concurrency, please send an email to llvm-dev.). Unordered; ---------. Unordered is the lowest level of atomicity. It essentially guarantees that races; produce somewhat sane results instead of having undefined behavior. It also; guarantees the operation to be lock-free, so it does not depend on the data; being part of a special atomic structure or depend on a separate per-process; global lock. Note that code generation will fail for unsupported atomic; operations; if you need such an operation, use explicit locking. Relevant standard; This is intended to match the Java memory model for shared variables. Notes for frontends; This cannot be used for synchronization, but is useful for Java and other; ""safe"" languages which need to guarantee that the generated code never; exhibits undefined behavior. Note that this guarantee is cheap on common; platforms for loads of a native width, but can be expensive or unavailable for; wider loads, like a 64-bit store on ARM. (A frontend for Java or other ""safe""; languages would normally split a 64-bit store on ARM into two 32-bit unordered; stores.). Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this prohibits any transformation that transforms a; single load into multiple loads, transforms a store into multiple stores,; narrows a store, or stores a value which would not be stored otherwise. Some; examples of unsafe optimizations are narrowing an assignment into a bitfield,; rematerializing a load, and turning loads and stores into a memcpy; call.

MSVC allows many invalid constructs in class templates that Clang has; historically rejected. In order to parse widely distributed headers for; libraries such as the Active Template Library (ATL) and Windows Runtime Library; (WRL), some template rules have been relaxed or extended in Clang on Windows. The first major semantic difference is that MSVC appears to defer all parsing; an analysis of inline method bodies in class templates until instantiation; time. By default on Windows, Clang attempts to follow suit. This behavior is; controlled by the ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` flag. While Clang delays; parsing of method bodies, it still parses the bodies *before* template argument; substitution, which is not what MSVC does. The following compatibility tweaks; are necessary to parse the template in those cases. MSVC allows some name lookup into dependent base classes. Even on other; platforms, this has been a `frequently asked question`_ for Clang users. A; dependent base class is a base class that depends on the value of a template; parameter. Clang cannot see any of the names inside dependent bases while it; is parsing your template, so the user is sometimes required to use the; ``typename`` keyword to assist the parser. On Windows, Clang attempts to; follow the normal lookup rules, but if lookup fails, it will assume that the; user intended to find the name in a dependent base. While parsing the; following program, Clang will recover as if the user had written the; commented-out code:. .. _frequently asked question:; https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct Foo : T {; void f() {; /*typename*/ T::UnknownType x = /*this->*/unknownMember;; }; };.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See; :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a; subset of the options specified on the command line, see; :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after; parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for; supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`; by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as; inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

A call to the; ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should cause content for the allocation to be; transferred from working to executor memory, and permissions to be run. A call; to ``abandon`` should result in both kinds of memory being deallocated. On successful finalization, the ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should; construct a ``FinalizedAlloc`` object (an opaque uint64_t id that the; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` can use to identify executor memory for deallocation); and pass it to the ``OnFinalized`` callback. Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process.

Integrability,"ll render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this RO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23355,depend,depending,23355,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"ll return the; dereferenced value same as plain C pointers, modulo the extra bounds checks; being performed before dereferencing the wide pointer. This means mapping the; wide pointers to struct types with equivalent layout won’t be sufficient. To; represent the wide pointers in Clang AST, we add an extra field in the; PointerType class to indicate the internal bounds of the pointer. This ensures; pointers of different representations are mapped to different canonical types; while they are still treated as pointers. In LLVM IR, wide pointers will be emitted as structs of equivalent; representations. Clang CodeGen will handle them as Aggregate in; ``TypeEvaluationKind (TEK)``. ``AggExprEmitter`` was extended to handle pointer; operations returning wide pointers. Alternatively, a new ``TEK`` and an; expression emitter dedicated to wide pointers could be introduced. Default bounds annotations; ==========================. The model may implicitly add ``__bidi_indexable`` or ``__single`` depending on; the context of the declaration that has the pointer type. ``__bidi_indexable``; implicitly adds to local variables, while ``__single`` implicitly adds to; pointer types specifying struct fields, function parameters, or global; variables. This means the parser may first create the pointer type without any; default pointer attribute and then recreate the type once the parser has the; declaration context and determined the default attribute accordingly. This also requires the parser to reset the type of the declaration with the; newly created type with the right default attribute. Promotion expression; ====================. A new expression will be introduced to represent the conversion from a pointer; with an external bounds annotation, such as ``__counted_by``, to; ``__bidi_indexable``.

The new option `noclear` avoid this behaviour. This is useful; when drawing a `THStack` on top of an other plot. If the patterns used to; draw the histograms in the stack are transparents, then the plot behind; will be visible. ### TH2Poly. - Implement a simple version of ""Scale"". ### TF1. - Change `TF1::Integral(double a, double b, double * params = 0, double eps = 1.E-12)` to; `TF1::Integral(doubnle a, double b, double epsrel=1.E-12)`. One should use `TF1::SetParameters` to; set the function parameters before computing the integral. - Add a new function `TF1::IntegralOneDim(Double_t a, Double_t b, Double_t epsrel, Double_t epsabs, Double_t &err)`; that returns as last argument the error in the integration. `TF1::Integral` is implemented using `Tf1::IntegralOneDim`. - The one-dim and multi-dim integral functions are now implemented using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`; classes. This allows to change the integration algorithm used in `TF1` using the static methods of the classes; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`. The default algorithm used are; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions::DefaultIntegratorType()` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions::DefaultIntegratorType()`.; For example, if ROOT has been built with mathmore the default one-dim integration type is the GSL AdaptiveSingular integration algorithm. - Implement the possibility to save a `TF1` as C code indenpant from; ROOT.

Integrability,"llAnalysesOn<Function>>()); return true;. // Check transitive dependencies.; return Inv.invalidate<BarAnalysis>(F, PA) ||; Inv.invalidate<BazAnalysis>(F, PA);; }. Combining invalidation and analysis manager proxies results in some; complexity. For example, when we invalidate all analyses in a module pass,; we have to make sure that we also invalidate function analyses accessible via; any existing inner proxies. The inner proxy's ``invalidate()`` first checks; if the proxy itself should be invalidated. If so, that means the proxy may; contain pointers to IR that is no longer valid, meaning that the inner proxy; needs to completely clear all relevant analysis results. Otherwise the proxy; simply forwards the invalidation to the inner analysis manager. Generally for outer proxies, analysis results from the outer analysis manager; should be immutable, so invalidation shouldn't be a concern. However, it is; possible for some inner analysis to depend on some outer analysis, and when; the outer analysis is invalidated, we need to make sure that dependent inner; analyses are also invalidated. This actually happens with alias analysis; results. Alias analysis is a function-level analysis, but there are; module-level implementations of specific types of alias analysis. Currently; ``GlobalsAA`` is the only module-level alias analysis and it generally is not; invalidated so this is not so much of a concern.

One interesting (and somewhat unusual) aspect of normal tokens is that they; don't contain any semantic information about the lexed value. For example, if; the token was a pp-number token, we do not represent the value of the number; that was lexed (this is left for later pieces of code to decide).; Additionally, the lexer library has no notion of typedef names vs variable; names: both are returned as identifiers, and the parser is left to decide; whether a specific identifier is a typedef or a variable (tracking this; requires scope information among other things). The parser can do this; translation by replacing tokens returned by the preprocessor with ""Annotation; Tokens"". .. _AnnotationToken:. Annotation Tokens; -----------------. Annotation tokens are tokens that are synthesized by the parser and injected; into the preprocessor's token stream (replacing existing tokens) to record; semantic information found by the parser. For example, if ""``foo``"" is found; to be a typedef, the ""``foo``"" ``tok::identifier`` token is replaced with an; ``tok::annot_typename``. This is useful for a couple of reasons: 1) this makes; it easy to handle qualified type names (e.g., ""``foo::bar::baz<42>::t``"") in; C++ as a single ""token"" in the parser. 2) if the parser backtracks, the; reparse does not need to redo semantic analysis to determine whether a token; sequence is a variable, type, template, etc. Annotation tokens are created by the parser and reinjected into the parser's; token stream (when backtracking is enabled). Because they can only exist in; tokens that the preprocessor-proper is done with, it doesn't need to keep; around flags like ""start of line"" that the preprocessor uses to do its job.; Additionally, an annotation token may ""cover"" a sequence of preprocessor tokens; (e.g., ""``a::b::c``"" is five preprocessor tok",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:48887,inject,injected,48887,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['inject'],['injected']

This makes ``CXX11`` and ``C23`` spellings; unsuitable for attributes that affect the type system, that change the; binary interface of the code, or that have other similar semantic meaning. ``RegularKeyword`` provides an alternative way of spelling such attributes.; It reuses the production rules for standard attributes, but it applies them; to plain keywords rather than to ``[[…]]`` sequences.

For example, the ``ArmStreaming`` function type attribute affects; both the type system and the binary interface of the function.; It cannot therefore be spelled ``[[arm::streaming]]``, since compilers; that don't understand ``arm::streaming`` would ignore it and miscompile; the code. ``ArmStreaming`` is instead spelled ``__arm_streaming``, but it; can appear wherever a hypothetical ``[[arm::streaming]]`` could appear.

DIFFERENCES TO LLVM-READELF; ---------------------------. :program:`llvm-readelf` is an alias for the :manpage:`llvm-readobj` tool with a; slightly different command-line interface and output that is GNU compatible.; Following is a list of differences between :program:`llvm-readelf` and; :program:`llvm-readobj`:. - :program:`llvm-readelf` uses `GNU` for the :option:`--elf-output-style` option; by default. :program:`llvm-readobj` uses `LLVM`.; - :program:`llvm-readelf` allows single-letter grouped flags (e.g.; ``llvm-readelf -SW`` is the same as ``llvm-readelf -S -W``).; :program:`llvm-readobj` does not allow grouping.; - :program:`llvm-readelf` provides :option:`-s` as an alias for; :option:`--symbols`, for GNU :program:`readelf` compatibility, whereas it is; an alias for :option:`--section-headers` in :program:`llvm-readobj`.; - :program:`llvm-readobj` provides ``-t`` as an alias for :option:`--symbols`.; :program:`llvm-readelf` does not.; - :program:`llvm-readobj` provides ``--sr``, ``--sd``, ``--st`` and ``--dt`` as; aliases for :option:`--section-relocations`, :option:`--section-data`,; :option:`--section-symbols` and :option:`--dyn-symbols` respectively.; :program:`llvm-readelf` does not provide these aliases, to avoid conflicting; with grouped flags.

Calling; ``exit`` upon encountering an error dramatically simplifies control flow as the; error no longer needs to be propagated up the stack. This allows code to be; written in straight-line style, as long as each fallible call is wrapped in a; check and call to exit. The ``ExitOnError`` class supports this pattern by; providing call operators that inspect ``Error`` values, stripping the error away; in the success case and logging to ``stderr`` then exiting in the failure case. To use this class, declare a global ``ExitOnError`` variable in your program:. .. code-block:: c++. ExitOnError ExitOnErr;. Calls to fallible functions can then be wrapped with a call to ``ExitOnErr``,; turning them into non-failing calls:. .. code-block:: c++. Error mayFail();; Expected<int> mayFail2();. void foo() {; ExitOnErr(mayFail());; int X = ExitOnErr(mayFail2());; }. On failure, the error's log message will be written to ``stderr``, optionally; preceded by a string ""banner"" that can be set by calling the setBanner method.

You; can still build only compiler-rt for instance. In this way it's not different; from someone who would check out all the projects with SVN today. If you want to avoid checking out all the sources, you can hide the other; directories using a Git sparse checkout::. git config core.sparseCheckout true; echo /compiler-rt > .git/info/sparse-checkout; git read-tree -mu HEAD. The data for all sub-projects is still in your `.git` directory, but in your; checkout, you only see `compiler-rt`.; Before you push, you'll need to fetch and rebase (`git pull --rebase`) as; usual. Note that when you fetch you'll likely pull in changes to sub-projects you don't; care about.

Integrability,"ltiple primitive data are; operated in parallel using a single instruction (SIMD). A vector type; requires a size (number of elements), an underlying primitive data type,; and a scalable property to represent vectors where the exact hardware; vector length is unknown at compile time. Vector types are considered; :ref:`first class <t_firstclass>`. :Memory Layout:. In general vector elements are laid out in memory in the same way as; :ref:`array types <t_array>`. Such an analogy works fine as long as the vector; elements are byte sized. However, when the elements of the vector aren't byte; sized it gets a bit more complicated. One way to describe the layout is by; describing what happens when a vector such as <N x iM> is bitcasted to an; integer type with N*M bits, and then following the rules for storing such an; integer to memory. A bitcast from a vector type to a scalar integer type will see the elements; being packed together (without padding). The order in which elements are; inserted in the integer depends on endianness. For little endian element zero; is put in the least significant bits of the integer, and for big endian; element zero is put in the most significant bits. Using a vector such as ``<i4 1, i4 2, i4 3, i4 5>`` as an example, together; with the analogy that we can replace a vector store by a bitcast followed by; an integer store, we get this for big endian:. .. code-block:: llvm. %val = bitcast <4 x i4> <i4 1, i4 2, i4 3, i4 5> to i16. ; Bitcasting from a vector to an integral type can be seen as; ; concatenating the values:; ; %val now has the hexadecimal value 0x1235. store i16 %val, ptr %ptr. ; In memory the content will be (8-bit addressing):; ;; ; [%ptr + 0]: 00010010 (0x12); ; [%ptr + 1]: 00110101 (0x35).

The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. #### Special case: Wrapping TF1 objects in Parametric Function interfaces. In many cases, the user works with the `TF1` class. The mathematical library in ROOT provides some solutions to wrap these into the interfaces needed by other methods.; If the desired interface to wrap is one-dimensional, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1`.; The default constructor takes a `TF1` reference as an argument, that will be wrapped with the interfaces of a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionOneDim`.; Example:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedTF1.h"". int main(); {. TF1 f(""Sin Function"", ""sin(x)+y"",0,3);. ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1 wf1(f);. cout << f(1) << endl;; cout << wf1(1) << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. For a TF1 defining a multidimensional function or in case we need to wrap in a multi-dimensional function interface, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1`.; Following the usual procedure, setting the `TF1` though the constructor, will wrap it into a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim`.; Example:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedMultiTF1.h"". int main(); {. TF2 f(""Sin Function"", ""sin(x) + y"",0,3,0,2);.

The following code enables the ``Expand`` conversion technique for; non-v9 SPARC implementations. .. code-block:: c++. setOperationAction(ISD::CTPOP, MVT::i32, Expand);; ...; if (TM.getSubtarget<SparcSubtarget>().isV9()); setOperationAction(ISD::CTPOP, MVT::i32, Legal);.

To support target-specific calling conventions, ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` uses; interfaces (such as ``CCIfType`` and ``CCAssignToReg``) that are defined in; ``lib/Target/TargetCallingConv.td``. TableGen can take the target descriptor; file ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` and generate the header file; ``XXXGenCallingConv.inc``, which is typically included in; ``XXXISelLowering.cpp``. You can use the interfaces in; ``TargetCallingConv.td`` to specify:. * The order of parameter allocation. * Where parameters and return values are placed (that is, on the stack or in; registers). * Which registers may be used. * Whether the caller or callee unwinds the stack. The following example demonstrates the use of the ``CCIfType`` and; ``CCAssignToReg`` interfaces. If the ``CCIfType`` predicate is true (that is,; if the current argument is of type ``f32`` or ``f64``), then the action is; performed.

Integrability,"lving the data; analysis challenges of high-energy physics. There are two key words in; this definition, object oriented and framework. First, we explain what; we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented; framework. ### What Is a Framework?. Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city.; Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services; provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the; services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones.; The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching; system, are transparent to you as the user. You do not care; you are; only interested in using the phone to communicate with your; collaborators to solve your domain specific problems. Programming outside of a framework may be compared to living in the; country. In order to have transportation and water, you will have to; build a road and dig a well. To have services like telephone and; electricity you will need to route the wires to your home. In; addition, you cannot build some things yourself. For example, you; cannot build a commercial airport on your patch of land. From a global; perspective, it would make no sense for everyone to build their; own airport. You see you will be very busy building the infrastructure; (or framework) before you can use the phone to communicate with your; collaborators and have a drink of water at the same time. In software; engineering, it is much the same way. In a framework, the basic; utilities and services, such as I/O and graphics, are provided. In; addition, ROOT being a HEP analysis framework, it provides a large; selection of HEP specific utilities such as histograms and fitting.; The drawback of a framework is that you are constrained to it, as you; are constraint to use the routing algorithm provided by your telephone; service. You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in; this analogy is the same as learning how to use a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:5618,rout,route,5618,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['rout'],['route']

Language and Compiler Issues; ----------------------------. Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Compiler warnings are often useful and help improve the code. Those that are; not useful, can be often suppressed with a small code change. For example, an; assignment in the ``if`` condition is often a typo:. .. code-block:: c++. if (V = getValue()) {; ...; }. Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }. Write Portable Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In almost all cases, it is possible to write completely portable code. When; you need to rely on non-portable code, put it behind a well-defined and; well-documented interface. Do not use RTTI or Exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In an effort to reduce code and executable size, LLVM does not use exceptions; or RTTI (`runtime type information; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information>`_, for example,; ``dynamic_cast<>``). That said, LLVM does make extensive use of a hand-rolled form of RTTI that use; templates like :ref:`isa\<>, cast\<>, and dyn_cast\<> <isa>`.; This form of RTTI is opt-in and can be; :doc:`added to any class <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. Prefer C++-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When casting, use ``static_cast``, ``reinterpret_cast``, and ``const_cast``,; rather than C-style casts. There are two exceptions to this:. * When casting to ``void`` to suppress warnings about unused variables (as an; alternative to ``[[maybe_unused]]``).

The new; binary accepts the same arguments as 'xrootd' and parses the same; directives form the same configuration file, with the exception of; 'xpd.protocol xproofd libXrdProofd.so' which should now be dropped. AN; alternative port can be specified via the new 'xpd.port' directive (see; above).; Add support for 'MasterOnly' mode in starting a PROOF; session.

The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Support`` interfaces.

These; headers and the things they declare are considered to be platform agnostic.; LLVM source files may include them or obtain their inclusion through; ``lib/Support`` interfaces. High Level Interface; --------------------. The entry points specified in the interface of ``lib/Support`` must be aimed at; completing some reasonably high level task needed by LLVM. We do not want to; simply wrap each operating system call. It would be preferable to wrap several; operating system calls that are always used in conjunction with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and ``wait``. The; correct thing for ``lib/Support`` to provide is a function, say; ``ExecuteProgramAndWait``, that implements the functionality completely. what; we don't want is wrappers for the operating system calls involved. There must **not** be a one-to-one relationship between operating system; calls and the Support library's interface. Any such interface function will be; suspicious.

General purpose structured; exceptions (SEH) are more analogous to Linux signals, and they are dispatched by; userspace DLLs provided with Windows. Each frame on the stack has an assigned EH; personality routine, which decides what actions to take to handle the exception.; There are a few major personalities for C and C++ code: the C++ personality; (``__CxxFrameHandler3``) and the SEH personalities (``_except_handler3``,; ``_except_handler4``, and ``__C_specific_handler``). All of them implement; cleanups by calling back into a ""funclet"" contained in the parent function. Funclets, in this context, are regions of the parent function that can be called; as though they were a function pointer with a very special calling convention.; The frame pointer of the parent frame is passed into the funclet either using; the standard EBP register or as the first parameter register, depending on the; architecture. The funclet implements the EH action by accessing local variables; in memory through the frame pointer, and returning some appropriate value,; continuing the EH process. No variables live in to or out of the funclet can be; allocated in registers. The C++ personality also uses funclets to contain the code for catch blocks; (i.e. all user code between the braces in ``catch (Type obj) { ... }``). The; runtime must use funclets for catch bodies because the C++ exception object is; allocated in a child stack frame of the function handling the exception. If the; runtime rewound the stack back to frame of the catch, the memory holding the; exception would be overwritten quickly by subsequent function calls. The use of; funclets also allows ``__CxxFrameHandler3`` to implement rethrow without; resorting to TLS. Instead, the runtime throws a special exception, and then uses; SEH (``__try / __except``) to res",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:22350,depend,depending,22350,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']

In C, two types are structurally equivalent if they are *compatible types*. For; a formal definition of *compatible types*, please refer to 6.2.7/1 in the C11; standard. However, there is no definition for *compatible types* in the C++; standard. Still, we extend the definition of structural equivalency to; templates and their instantiations similarly: besides checking the previously; mentioned properties, we have to check for equivalent template; parameters/arguments, etc. The structural equivalent check can be and is used independently from the; ASTImporter, e.g. the ``clang::Sema`` class uses it also. The equivalence of nodes may depend on the equivalency of other pairs of nodes.; Thus, the check is implemented as a parallel graph traversal. We traverse; through the nodes of both graphs at the same time. The actual implementation is; similar to breadth-first-search. Let's say we start the traverse with the <A,B>; pair of nodes. Whenever the traversal reaches a pair <X,Y> then the following; statements are true:. - A and X are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - B and Y are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - A and B may or may not be from the same ASTContext.; - if A == X and B == Y (pointer equivalency) then (there is a cycle during the; traverse). - A and B are structurally equivalent if and only if. - All dependent nodes on the path from <A,B> to <X,Y> are structurally; equivalent.

A `TFile` does not take ownership of any `RNTuple` objects. When reading data, RNTuple uses the `RMiniFile` and `RRawFile` classes to open a given storage path and find the `RNTuple` anchor.; When creating a `RNTupleReader` from an existing anchor object, RNTuple uses `RRawFile` only for files of dynamic type `TFile`, `TDavixFile`, and `TNetXNGFile`.; In either case, the `RRawFile` owns its own file descriptor and does not interfere with `TFile` objects concurrently reading the file.; For anchors from files of other dynamic type, including all other `TFile` subclasses, the file is wrapped in a `RRawFileTFile` and access is shared. On-Disk Encoding; ----------------. ### Writing Case; The following steps are taken to write RNTuple data to disk:. 1. On creation of the RNTupleWriter, the header is written to disk; 2. Upon `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`, the RField<T> class _serializes_ the object into its column representation.; To this end, it uses the `RColumn` class to append elements to the columns page buffer (`RPage`); 3. When a page buffer is full (cf. tuning.md), it is sent to the page sink for writing it to disk.; Note that page boundaries do _not_ need to align with entry boundaries,; e.g. information from a single entry can span multiple pages.; 1. The page is _packed_:; depending on the type of the page, a light encoding is applied to facilitate compression, e.g., byte splitting (`RColumnElement`).; Big-endian / little-endian conversion takes place here.; 2.

This type; of rule is typically used to implement an interactive renaming action that; allows users to specify which occurrences should be renamed during the; refactoring. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to implement; the ``findSymbolOccurrences`` member function. The following set of quick checks might help if you are unsure about the type; of rule you should use:. #.

This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Toolchains**. The gcc driver has no direct understanding of tool chains. Each gcc; binary roughly corresponds to the information which is embedded; inside a single ToolChain. The clang driver is intended to be portable and support complex; compilation environments. All platform and tool chain specific code; should be protected behind either abstract or well defined interfaces; (such as whether the platform supports use as a driver driver).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:16175,rout,routines,16175,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,2,"['interface', 'rout']","['interfaces', 'routines']"

The C++ standard specifies that “any [non-standard attribute] that is not; recognized by the implementation is ignored” (``[dcl.attr.grammar]``).; The rule for C is similar. This makes ``CXX11`` and ``C23`` spellings; unsuitable for attributes that affect the type system, that change the; binary interface of the code, or that have other similar semantic meaning. ``RegularKeyword`` provides an alternative way of spelling such attributes.; It reuses the production rules for standard attributes, but it applies them; to plain keywords rather than to ``[[…]]`` sequences. Compilers that don't; recognize the keyword are likely to report an error of some kind. For example, the ``ArmStreaming`` function type attribute affects; both the type system and the binary interface of the function.; It cannot therefore be spelled ``[[arm::streaming]]``, since compilers; that don't understand ``arm::streaming`` would ignore it and miscompile; the code. ``ArmStreaming`` is instead spelled ``__arm_streaming``, but it; can appear wherever a hypothetical ``[[arm::streaming]]`` could appear.

Integrability,"m, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code. We have also found that a large; amount of our usage of type hierarchies fits better with tag-based pattern; matching rather than dynamic dispatch across a common interface. Within LLVM we; have built custom helpers to facilitate this design.

LibFuzzer requires a matching version of Clang. Getting Started; ===============. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 1. Fuzz Target; -----------. The first step in using libFuzzer on a library is to implement a; *fuzz target* -- a function that accepts an array of bytes and; does something interesting with these bytes using the API under test.; Like this:. .. code-block:: c++. // fuzz_target.cc; extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {; DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);; return 0; // Values other than 0 and -1 are reserved for future use.; }. Note that this fuzz target does not depend on libFuzzer in any way; and so it is possible and even desirable to use it with other fuzzing engines; e.g. AFL_ and/or Radamsa_. Some important things to remember about fuzz targets:. * The fuzzing engine will execute the fuzz target many times with different inputs in the same process.; * It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).; * It must not `exit()` on any input.; * It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.; * It must be as deterministic as possible. Non-determinism (e.g. random decisions not based on the input bytes) will make fuzzing inefficient.; * It must be fast. Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.; * Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although that's not strict).; * Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format. Fuzzer Usage; ------------.

LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases. For example compiler-rt; can be built without LLVM, and the compiler-rt sanitizer libraries are used; with GCC. Useful Built-in Commands; ========================.

The information making up an; option definition includes its prefix and name (for example ``-std=``), form and; position of the option value, help text, aliases and more.

The most general phase of alias processing occurs while matching is happening:; it provides new forms for the matcher to match along with a specific instruction; to generate. An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate. For example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rr8W GR16:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rm8W GR16:$dst, i8mem:$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr8 GR32:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr16 GR32:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr8 GR64:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr16 GR64:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr32 GR64:$dst, GR32 :$src)>;. This shows a powerful example of the instruction aliases, matching the same; mnemonic in multiple different ways depending on what operands are present in; the assembly. The result of instruction aliases can include operands in a; different order than the destination instruction, and can use an input multiple; times, for example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""clrb $reg"", (XOR8rr GR8 :$reg, GR8 :$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrw $reg"", (XOR16rr GR16:$reg, GR16:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrl $reg"", (XOR32rr GR32:$reg, GR32:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrq $reg"", (XOR64rr GR64:$reg, GR64:$reg)>;. This example also shows that tied operands are only listed once. In the X86; backend, XOR8rr has two input GR8's and one output GR8 (where an input is tied; to the output). InstAliases take a flattened operand list without duplicates; for tied operands. The result of an instruction alias can also use immediates; and fixed physical registers which are added as simple immediate operands in the; result, for example:. ::. // Fixed Immediate operand.; def : InstAlias<""aad"", (AAD8i8 10)>;. // Fixe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:84302,depend,depending,84302,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']

LLVMRemarkParserRef Parser = LLVMRemarkParserCreateYAML(Buf, Size);; LLVMRemarkEntryRef Remark = NULL;; while ((Remark = LLVMRemarkParserGetNext(Parser))) {; // use Remark; LLVMRemarkEntryDispose(Remark); // Release memory.; }; bool HasError = LLVMRemarkParserHasError(Parser);; LLVMRemarkParserDispose(Parser);.

All remark serialization should go through the main remark streamer, the; ``llvm::remarks::RemarkStreamer`` set up in the ``LLVMContext``. The interface; takes remark objects converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark``, and takes care of; serializing it to the requested format, using the requested type of metadata,; etc. Typically, a specialized remark streamer will hold a reference to the one set; up in the ``LLVMContext``, and will operate on its own type of diagnostics. For example, LLVM IR passes will emit ``llvm::DiagnosticInfoOptimization*``; that get converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark`` objects. Then, clang could set; up its own specialized remark streamer that takes ``clang::Diagnostic``; objects. This can allow various components of the frontend to emit remarks; using the same techniques as the LLVM remarks. This gives us the following advantages:. * Composition: during the compilation pipeline, multiple components can set up; their specialized remark streamers that all emit remarks through the same; main streamer.; * Re-using the remark infrastructure in ``lib/Remarks``.; * Using the same file and format for the remark emitters created throughout the; compilation. at the cost of an extra layer of abstr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Remarks.rst:17240,interface,interface,17240,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Remarks.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Remarks.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

The anchor is a data block that represents the entry point to an RNTuple.; The anchor is specific to the RNTuple container in which the RNTuple data are embedded (e.g., a ROOT file or an object store).; The anchor must provide the information to load the header and the footer **envelopes**. ### Cluster. A cluster is a set of **pages** that contain all the data belonging to an entry range.; The data set is partitioned in clusters.; A typical cluster size is tens to hundreds of megabytes. ### Column. A column is a storage backed vector of a number of **elements** of a simple type.; Column elements have a fixed bit-length that depends on the column type.; Some column types allow setting the bit lengths within specific limits (e.g. for floats with truncated mantissa). ### Envelope. An envelope is a data block with RNTuple meta-data, such as the header and the footer. ### Field. A field describes a serialized C++ type.; A field can have a hierarchy of subfields representing a composed C++ type (e.g., a vector of integers).; A field has zero, one, or multiple **columns** attached to it.; The columns contain the data related to the field but not to its subfields, which have their own columns. ### Frame. A frame is a byte range with metadata information in an **envelope**.; A frame starts with its size and thus can be extended in a forward-compatible way. ### Locator. A locator is a generalized way to identify a byte range in the RNTuple container.; For a file container, for instance, a locator consists of an offset and a size. ### Page. A page is segment of a column.; Columns are partitioned in pages.;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/BinaryFormatSpecification.md:50592,depend,depends,50592,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/BinaryFormatSpecification.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/BinaryFormatSpecification.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

When two transforms use different instances of the; uniformity analysis for the same CFG, a ""divergent value"" result in; one analysis instance cannot contradict a ""uniform value"" result in; the other. Generic transforms such as SimplifyCFG, CSE, and loop transforms; commonly change the program in ways that change the maximal; converged-with relations. This also means that a value that was; previously uniform can become divergent after such a transform.; Uniformity has to be recomputed after such transforms. Divergent Branch inside a Cycle; -------------------------------. .. figure:: convergence-divergent-inside.png; :name: convergence-divergent-inside. The above figure shows a divergent branch ``Q`` inside an irreducible; cyclic region. When two threads diverge at ``Q``, the convergence of; dynamic instances within the cyclic region depends on the cycle; hierarchy chosen:. 1. In an implementation that detects a single cycle ``C`` with header; ``P``, convergence inside the cycle is determined by ``P``. 2. In an implementation that detects two nested cycles with headers; ``R`` and ``S``, convergence inside those cycles is determined by; their respective headers. .. _convergence-diverged-entry:. A conservative approach would be to simply report all nodes inside; irreducible cycles as having divergent outputs. But it is desirable to; recognize m-converged nodes in the CFG in order to maximize; uniformity.

In several cases, the misunderstanding of the interface caused invalid memory accesses to the already destructed; temporary `TString` returned by `GetString()`, e.g. `objStr->GetString().Data()`. This will be fixed automatically by the; new return type. In rare cases, the caller expected `GetString()` to return a (non-const) reference to the embedded `TString`, e.g.; `objString->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b""); // WRONG!` This will now fail to compile, instead of not doing what the author of the; code expected. Please fix that code by using the `TObjString::String()` interface, which returns a non-const `TString&`:; `objString->String().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b"");`. In extremely rare cases, this change breaks a valid use where the temporary `TString` was modified and then captured in a new `TString`; object before the destruction of the temporary: `TString str = objStr->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b"");`.

Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to be able to force an object to be; released at a precise time, even if that object does not appear to be used.; This is likely to be uncommon enough that the syntactic weight of explicitly; requesting these semantics will not be burdensome, and may even make the code; clearer. .. _arc.misc:. Miscellaneous; =============. .. _arc.misc.special_methods:. Special methods; ---------------. .. _arc.misc.special_methods.retain:. Memory management methods; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A program is ill-formed if it contains a method definition, message send, or; ``@selector`` expression for any of the following selectors:. * ``autorelease``; * ``release``; * ``retain``; * ``retainCount``. .. admonition:: Rationale. ``retainCount`` is banned because ARC robs it of consistent semantics. The; others were banned after weighing three options for how to deal with message; sends:. **Honoring** them would work out very poorly if a programmer naively or; accidentally tried to incorporate code written for manual retain/release code; into an ARC program. At best, such code would do twice as much work as; necessary; quite frequently, however, ARC and the explicit code would both; try to balance the same retain, leading to crashes. The cost is losing the; ability to perform ""unrooted"" retains, i.e. retains not logically; corresponding to a strong reference in the object graph. **Ignoring** them would badly violate user expectations about their code.; While it *would* make it easier to develop code simultaneously for ARC and; non-ARC, there is very little reason to do so except for certain library; developers. ARC and non-ARC translation units share an execution model and; can seamlessly interoperate.

To simplify the use of autorelease pools, and to bring them under the control; of the compiler, a new kind of statement is available in Objective-C. It is; written ``@autoreleasepool`` followed by a *compound-statement*, i.e. by a new; scope delimited by curly braces. Upon entry to this block, the current state; of the autorelease pool is captured. When the block is exited normally,; whether by fallthrough or directed control flow (such as ``return`` or; ``break``), the autorelease pool is restored to the saved state, releasing all; the objects in it. When the block is exited with an exception, the pool is not; drained. ``@autoreleasepool`` may be used in non-ARC translation units, with equivalent; semantics. A program is ill-formed if it refers to the ``NSAutoreleasePool`` class. .. admonition:: Rationale. Autorelease pools are clearly important for the compiler to reason about, but; it is far too much to expect the compiler to accurately reason about control; dependencies between two calls. It is also very easy to accidentally forget; to drain an autorelease pool when using the manual API, and this can; significantly inflate the process's high-water-mark. The introduction of a; new scope is unfortunate but basically required for sane interaction with the; rest of the language. Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation. This means that the variable is; retained elsewhere, and therefore the implementation can elide retaining and; releasing its value. Such a variable is implicitly ``const`` for safety. In; contrast with ``__unsafe_unretained``, an externally-retained variable still; behaves as a strong variable o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:91482,depend,dependencies,91482,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

The first argument is always a type used as the basis for the calculations.; The second argument is always a pointer or a vector of pointers, and is the; base address to start from. The remaining arguments are indices; that indicate which of the elements of the aggregate object are indexed.; The interpretation of each index is dependent on the type being indexed; into. The first index always indexes the pointer value given as the; second argument, the second index indexes a value of the type pointed to; (not necessarily the value directly pointed to, since the first index; can be non-zero), etc. The first type indexed into must be a pointer; value, subsequent types can be arrays, vectors, and structs. Note that; subsequent types being indexed into can never be pointers, since that; would require loading the pointer before continuing calculation. The type of each index argument depends on the type it is indexing into.; When indexing into a (optionally packed) structure, only ``i32`` integer; **constants** are allowed (when using a vector of indices they must all; be the **same** ``i32`` integer constant). When indexing into an array,; pointer or vector, integers of any width are allowed, and they are not; required to be constant. These integers are treated as signed values; where relevant.

Integrability,"mental, ; bottom-up [[3]] adoption of the modules feature. Modules in Clang are designed; to work for C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++ and Swift. Users can enable the; modules feature without modifications in header files. The LLVM compiler allows; users to specify module interfaces in dedicated file, called *module maps files*.; A module map file expresses the mapping between a module file and a collection; of header files. If the compiler finds such file in the include paths it; automatically generates, imports and uses module files. The module map files can; be mounted using the compiler's virtual file system overlay mechanism to; non-writable production library installations. In practice, a non-invasive *modularization* can be done easily by introducing; a module map file. ```cpp; // A.h ; int pow2(int x) {; return x * x;; }; ```; ```cpp; // B.cpp; #include ""A.h"" // clang rewires this to import A.; int main() {; return pow2(42);; }; ```. ```cpp; // A.h module interface, aka module map file; module A {; header ""A.h""; export * // clang exports the contents of A.h as part of module A.; }; ```. A.h defines *pow2*, the module map file instructs clang to create *A.pcm* and; import it in B.cpp. In a number of cases the module map files can be automatically generated if the; build system knows about the list of header files in every package. . ### Header parsing in ROOT. ```cpp; // A.h; #include <string>; #include <vector>; template <class T, class U = int> struct AStruct {; void doIt() { /*...*/ }; std::string Name; ; std::vector<U> Collection;; // ...; };. template<class T, class U = AStruct<T>>; inline void freeFunction() { /* ... */ }; inline void do(unsigned N = 1) { /* ... */ }. ``` ; The associated with libA header files form libA's full descriptor.

However ORC also provides built-in support for lazy; compilation via lazy-reexports (see :ref:`Laziness`). **Support for Custom Compilers and Program Representations**; Clients can supply custom compilers for each symbol that they define in their; JIT session. ORC will run the user-supplied compiler when the a definition of; a symbol is needed.

Printing Error Messages; =======================. TableGen records are often derived from multiple classes and also often; defined through a sequence of multiclasses. Because of this, it can be; difficult for backends to report clear error messages with accurate source; file locations. To make error reporting easier, five error reporting; functions are provided, each with four overloads. * ``PrintWarning`` prints a message tagged as a warning. * ``PrintError`` prints a message tagged as an error. * ``PrintFatalError`` prints a message tagged as an error and then terminates. * ``PrintNote`` prints a note. It is often used after one of the previous; functions to provide more information. * ``PrintFatalNote`` prints a note and then terminates. Each of these five functions is overloaded four times. * ``PrintError(const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message with no source file location. * ``PrintError(ArrayRef<SMLoc> ErrorLoc, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the specified source line,; along with a pointer to the item in error. The array of; source file locations is typically taken from a ``Record`` instance. * ``PrintError(const Record *Rec, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record (see `Record`_). * ``PrintError(const RecordVal *RecVal, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record field (see `RecordVal`_). Using these functions, the goal is to produce the most specific error report; possible. Debugging Tools; ===============. TableGen provides some tools to aid in debugging backends.

The requirement to annotate all pointers with explicit bounds information could; present a significant adoption burden. To tackle this issue, the model; incorporates the concept of a ""wide pointer"" (a.k.a. fat pointer) – a larger; pointer that carries bounds information alongside the pointer value. Utilizing; wide pointers can potentially reduce the adoption burden, as it contains bounds; information internally and eliminates the need for explicit bounds annotations.; However, wide pointers differ from standard C pointers in their data layout,; which may result in incompatibilities with the application binary interface; (ABI). Breaking the ABI complicates interoperability with external code that has; not adopted the same programming model. ``-fbounds-safety`` harmonizes the wide pointer and the bounds annotation; approaches to reduce the adoption burden while maintaining the ABI. In this; model, local variables of pointer type are implicitly treated as wide pointers,; allowing them to carry bounds information without requiring explicit bounds; annotations. Please note that this approach doesn't apply to function parameters; which are considered ABI-visible. As local variables are typically hidden from; the ABI, this approach has a marginal impact on it. In addition,; ``-fbounds-safety`` employs compile-time restrictions to prevent implicit wide; pointers from silently breaking the ABI (see `ABI implications of default bounds; annotations`_).

In; this initial implementation of our JIT we will make our modules ""available for; execution"" by adding them to the CompileLayer, which will it turn store the; Module in the main JITDylib. This process will create new symbol table entries; in the JITDylib for each definition in the module, and will defer compilation of; the module until any of its definitions is looked up. Note that this is not lazy; compilation: just referencing a definition, even if it is never used, will be; enough to trigger compilation. In later chapters we will teach our JIT to defer; compilation of functions until they're actually called. To add our Module we; must first wrap it in a ThreadSafeModule instance, which manages the lifetime of; the Module's LLVMContext (our Ctx member) in a thread-friendly way. In our; example, all modules will share the Ctx member, which will exist for the; duration of the JIT. Once we switch to concurrent compilation in later chapters; we will use a new context per module.

Because the C++; exception object lives in stack memory, LLVM cannot provide a custom personality; function that uses landingpads. Similarly, SEH does not provide any mechanism; to rethrow an exception or continue unwinding. Therefore, LLVM must use the IR; constructs described later in this document to implement compatible exception; handling. SEH filter expressions; -----------------------. The SEH personality functions also use funclets to implement filter expressions,; which allow executing arbitrary user code to decide which exceptions to catch.; Filter expressions should not be confused with the ``filter`` clause of the LLVM; ``landingpad`` instruction. Typically filter expressions are used to determine; if the exception came from a particular DLL or code region, or if code faulted; while accessing a particular memory address range. LLVM does not currently have; IR to represent filter expressions because it is difficult to represent their; control dependencies. Filter expressions run during the first phase of EH,; before cleanups run, making it very difficult to build a faithful control flow; graph. For now, the new EH instructions cannot represent SEH filter; expressions, and frontends must outline them ahead of time.

As a secondary goal, they are designed to be generic across MSVC; and Itanium C++ exceptions.

Integrability,"mport declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_; This semantic import model addresses many of the problems of the preprocessor inclusion model:. * **Compile-time scalability**: The ``std.io`` module is only compiled once, and importing the module into a translation unit is a constant-time operation (independent of module system). Thus, the API of each software library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an *M + N* problem. * **Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a consistent preprocessor environment. This completely eliminates the need for ``__underscored`` names and similarly defensive tricks. Moreover, the current preprocessor definitions when an import declaration is encountered are ignored, so one software library can not affect how another software library is compiled, eliminating include-order dependencies. * **Tool confusion**: Modules describe the API of software libraries, and tools can reason about and present a module as a representation of that API. Because modules can only be built standalone, tools can rely on the module definition to ensure that they get the complete API for the library.

The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them.

FIXME: create new refactoring action tutorial and link to the tutorial. Introduction; ------------. Clang's refactoring engine defines a set refactoring actions that implement; a number of different source transformations. The ``clang-refactor``; command-line tool can be used to perform these refactorings. Certain; refactorings are also available in other clients like text editors and IDEs. A refactoring action is a class that defines a list of related refactoring; operations (rules). These rules are grouped under a common umbrella - a single; ``clang-refactor`` command. In addition to rules, the refactoring action; provides the action's command name and description to ``clang-refactor``.; Each action must implement the ``RefactoringAction`` interface. Here's an; outline of a ``local-rename`` action:. .. code-block:: c++. class LocalRename final : public RefactoringAction {; public:; StringRef getCommand() const override { return ""local-rename""; }. StringRef getDescription() const override {; return ""Finds and renames symbols in code with no indexer support"";; }. RefactoringActionRules createActionRules() const override {; ...; }; };. Refactoring Action Rules; ------------------------. An individual refactoring action is responsible for creating the set of; grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.; Although the rules in one action may have a number of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result.

ROOT provides C++ classes implementing numerical algorithms to solve a wide set of problem, like:. * Evaluation of function derivatives.; * Evaluation of integrals.; * Finding the roots of a function; * Finding the minimum/maximum of a function. In order to use these algorithm the user needs to provide a function.; ROOT provides a common way of specifying them via some interfaces. ## ROOT::Math Function interfaces.

These include:. - `Next`; `Returns the next member of the collection or 0 if no more members.`. - `Reset` `Resets the iterator so that ` `Next`; ` returns the first object.`. ## A Collectable Class. By default, all objects of **`TObject`** derived classes can be stored; in ROOT containers. However, the **`TObject`** class provides some; member functions that allow you to tune the behavior of objects in; containers. For example, by default two objects are considered equal if; their pointers point to the same address. This might be too strict for; some classes where equality is already achieved if some or all of the; data members are equal. By overriding the following **`TObject`** member; functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. - `IsEqual()`is used by the `FindObject() `collection method. By; default, `IsEqual()` compares the two object pointers. - `Compare()`returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller,; equal or larger than the other object. By default, a **`TObject`**; has not a valid `Compare()` method. - `IsSortable() `returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it; has a valid `Compare(`) method). By default, a **`TObject`** is not; sort able. - `Hash() `returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an; object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique,; like **`THashTable`**, **`THashList`** and **`TMap`**. By default,; `Hash(`) returns the address of the object. It is essential to; choose a good hash function. The example below shows how to use and override these member functions. ``` {.cpp}; class TObjNum : public TObject {; private:; Int_t num; // TObjNum is a simple container for an integer.; public:; TObjNum(Int_t i = 0) : num(i) { }; ~TObjNum() { }; void SetNum(Int_t i) { num = i; }; Int_t GetNum() const { return num; }; void Print(Option_t *) const; { printf(""num = %dn"", num); }; Bool_t IsEqual(TObject *obj) const; { return num == ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:9026,depend,depending,9026,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['depend'],['depending']

ROOT does no longer support Python 2. The minimum Python version necessary to use ROOT in a Python application is 3.8.; As a consequence, any reference to Python 2 in ROOT code was removed and certain configuration options are no longer; usable, e.g. * `root-config --python2-version`; * cmake -Dpyroot-python2.

Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small.

The ``JITDylib`` determines *where* the definitions; reside, the layers determine *how* the definitions will be compiled.; Linkage relationships between ``JITDylibs`` determine how inter-module; references are resolved, and symbol resolvers are no longer used. See the; section `Design Overview`_ for more details. Unless multiple JITDylibs are needed to model linkage relationships, ORCv1; clients should place all code in a single JITDylib.; MCJIT clients should use LLJIT (see `LLJIT and LLLazyJIT`_), and can place; code in LLJIT's default created main JITDylib (See; ``LLJIT::getMainJITDylib()``). 2. All JIT stacks now need an ``ExecutionSession`` instance. ExecutionSession; manages the string pool, error reporting, synchronization, and symbol; lookup. 3.

We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ## TTree Libraries. ### Improvement of handling of default number of entries. A new const expression value: `TTree::kMaxEntries` has been introduced to; express the largest possible entry number in a `TTree`. This is used in; two main cases:. - as the default value for the requested number of entries a routine should be; applied to; for example this is used for `TTree::Draw` and `TTree::Process`.; Previously the default was only 1 billions entries, causing those routines to; end early in case of very large trees. - as the default value for the number of entries returned by TChain::GetEntriesFast.; The previous value was kBigNumber (set to 1234567890) and internally (but somewhat; inconsistently, see [ROOT-6885]) a larger value was used (named theBigNumber). Now; `TTree::kMaxEntries` is used throughout TChain. `TChain::kBigNumber` is deprecated and its value has been changed to be equal; to `TTree::kMaxEntries`. ### MakeSelector. `TTree::MakeSelector` has been update to generate a code skeleton based on the `TTreeReader` rather than the old style relying on numeric data members replacements for the user objects. The main advantage is the lifting of the problem related to the fact that the old style was using fixed size array to represent variable size collection. `TTree::MakeSelector` takes an option ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md:8778,rout,routine,8778,README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,1,['rout'],['routine']

This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple by around 30% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.; - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.; - Move RStringView.h to ROOT/RStringView.hxx and always include ROOT/RStringView.hxx instead of RStringView.h for backward compatibility; - In `TClingCallFunc`, support r-value reference parameters. This paves the way for the corresponding support in PyROOT (implemented now in the latest Cppyy).; - Included the new TSequentialExecutor in ROOT, sharing the interfaces of TExecutor.This should improve code economy when providing a fallback for TThreadExecutor/TProcessExecutor. ### Thread safety; - Resolved several race conditions, dead-locks, performance and order of initialization/destruction issues still lingering because of or despite the new read-write lock mechanism. ## Interpreter. - Enabled use of multi-threaded code from the interpreter.; - Previouslyl multi-threaded code could be run from the interpreter as long as the call starting the threada was the same code that initialized the ROOT global lock, any other uses, including attempting to run the same code a second time in the same session would lead to a dead lock (if any other thread attempted to take on the ROOT lock).; - The interpreter now suspend the ROOT lock (which is taken to protect the interpreter global state) during user code execution. ## I/O Libraries; - LZ4 (with compression level 4) is now the default compression algorithm for new ROOT files (L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md:2401,interface,interfaces,2401,README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

The second one uses the Gauss Legendre quadrature formula.

Python frontend would inject two more suspend points, so that the actual code; looks like this:. .. code-block:: c. void* coroutine(int n) {; int current_value;; <designate current_value to be coroutine promise>; <SUSPEND> // injected suspend point, so that the coroutine starts suspended; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; current_value = i; <SUSPEND>; // corresponds to ""yield i""; }; <SUSPEND final=true> // injected final suspend point; }. and python iterator `__next__` would look like:. .. code-block:: c++. int __next__(void* hdl) {; coro.resume(hdl);; if (coro.done(hdl)) throw StopIteration();; return *(int*)coro.promise(hdl, 4, false);; }.

The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code. So we have to keep the; code copies in memory near the original code (they can't be far enough; away that a single pc-relative branch would not work.) Malloc() or; data region space is too far away. this impacts the design of the ; trace cache. We use a dummy function that is full of a bunch of for loops which we; overwrite with trace-cache code. The trace manager keeps track of; whether or not we have enough space in the trace cache, etc. The trace insertion routine takes an original start address, a vector; of machine instructions representing the trace, index of branches and; their corresponding absolute targets, and index of calls and their; corresponding absolute targets. The trace insertion routine is responsible for inserting branches from; the beginning of the original code to the beginning of the optimized; trace. This is because at some point the trace cache may run out of; space and it may have to evict a trace, at which point the branch to; the trace would also have to be removed. It uses a round-robin; replacement policy; we have found that this is almost as good as LRU; and better than random (especially because of problems fitting the new; trace in.). We cannot deal with discontiguous trace cache areas. The trace cache; is supposed to be cache-line-aligned, but it is not page-aligned.

Integrability,"n the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirectory; ``build/usr/include`` and place the header ``mylib.h`` into that; subdirectory. If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build /path/to/build/mylib.h mylib.h.pch.

Integrability,"n the stack. The heap object will live until the; delete operator is applied to it. There is no FORTRAN parallel to a heap object; variables either come; or go as control passes in and out of a function or subroutine, or,; like a COMMON block variables, live for the lifetime of the program.; However, most people in HEP who use FORTRAN will have experience of a; memory manager and the act of creating a bank is a good equivalent of; a heap object. For those who know systems like ZEBRA, it will come as; a relief to learn that objects do not move, C++ does not garbage; collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object; becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object,; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no; longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other; object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Although we chose to call our pointer `my_objptr`, to emphasize that; it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```. As we have seen, heap objects; have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be; accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; ```. Here we have a `Quad` pointer that has been initialized with the; address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of; stack objects.

A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean; operation between only two shape components. All information identifying; these two components as well as their positions with respect to the; frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node.; A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node. Since the shape; components may also be composites, they will also contain binary Boolean; nodes branching out other two shapes in the hierarchy. Any such branch; ends-up when the final leaves are no longer composite shapes, but basic; primitives. The figure shows the composite shapes structure. ![The composite shapes structure](pictures/080001CA.png). Suppose that A, B, C and D represent basic shapes, we will illustrate; how the internal representation of few combinations look like. We do; this only for understanding how to create them in a proper way, since; the user interface for this purpose is in fact very simple. We will; ignore for the time being the positioning of components. The definition; of a composite shape takes an expression where the identifiers are shape; names. The expression is parsed and decomposed in 2 sub-expressions and; the top-level Boolean operator. 1. Union: `A+B+C`. Just to illustrate the Boolean expression parsing and the composite; shape structure, let's take a simple example. We will describe the union; of A, B and C. Both union operators are at the same level. Since:. `A+B+C = (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)`. The first` (+)` is taken as separator, hence the expression split in:; `A` and `(B+C)`. A Boolean node of type **`TGeoUnion`**`(""A"",""B+C"")` is; created. This tries to replace the 2 expressions by actual pointers to; corresponding shapes. The first expression (A) contains no operators; therefore is interpreted as representing a shape. The shape named ""A"" is; searched into the list of shapes handled by the man",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:44358,interface,interface,44358,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"n type. * TLS -- Argument and return value labels are passed through TLS variables; ``__dfsan_arg_tls`` and ``__dfsan_retval_tls``. The main advantage of the TLS ABI is that it is more tolerant of ABI mismatches; (TLS storage is not shared with any other form of storage, whereas extra; arguments may be stored in registers which under the native ABI are not used; for parameter passing and thus could contain arbitrary values). On the other; hand the args ABI is more efficient and allows ABI mismatches to be more easily; identified by checking for nonzero labels in nominally unlabelled programs. Implementing the ABI list; -------------------------. The `ABI list <DataFlowSanitizer.html#abi-list>`_ provides a list of functions; which conform to the native ABI, each of which is callable from an instrumented; program. This is implemented by replacing each reference to a native ABI; function with a reference to a function which uses the instrumented ABI.; Such functions are automatically-generated wrappers for the native functions.; For example, given the ABI list example provided in the user manual, the; following wrappers will be generated under the args ABI:. .. code-block:: llvm. define linkonce_odr { i8*, i16 } @""dfsw$malloc""(i64 %0, i16 %1) {; entry:; %2 = call i8* @malloc(i64 %0); %3 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } undef, i8* %2, 0; %4 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } %3, i16 0, 1; ret { i8*, i16 } %4; }. define linkonce_odr { i32, i16 } @""dfsw$tolower""(i32 %0, i16 %1) {; entry:; %2 = call i32 @tolower(i32 %0); %3 = insertvalue { i32, i16 } undef, i32 %2, 0; %4 = insertvalue { i32, i16 } %3, i16 %1, 1; ret { i32, i16 } %4; }. define linkonce_odr { i8*, i16 } @""dfsw$memcpy""(i8* %0, i8* %1, i64 %2, i16 %3, i16 %4, i16 %5) {; entry:; %labelreturn = alloca i16; %6 = call i8* @__dfsw_memcpy(i8* %0, i8* %1, i64 %2, i16 %3, i16 %4, i16 %5, i16* %labelreturn); %7 = load i16* %labelreturn; %8 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } undef, i8* %6, 0; %9 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } %8, i16 %7, 1; ret {",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst:11228,wrap,wrappers,11228,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrappers']

Integrability,"n you're; done with it. ### Use of Python Functions. It is possible to mix Python functions with ROOT and perform such; operations as plotting and fitting of histograms with them. In all; cases, the procedure consists of instantiating a ROOT **`TF1`**,; **`TF2`**, or **`TF3`** with the Python function and working with that; ROOT object. There are some memory issues, so it is for example not yet; possible to delete a **`TF1`** instance and then create another one with; the same name. In addition, the Python function, once used for; instantiating the **`TF1`**, is never deleted. Instead of a Python function, you can also use callable instances (e.g.,; an instance of a class that has implemented the `__call__` member; function). The signature of the Python callable should provide for one; or two arrays. The first array, which must always be present, shall; contain the `x`, `y`, `z`, and t values for the call. The second array,; which is optional and its size depends on the number given to the; **`TF1`** constructor, contains the values that parameterize the; function. For more details, see the **`TF1`** documentation and the; examples below. #### Plotting Python Function. This is an example of a parameter less Python function that is plotted; on a default canvas:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TCanvas. def identity( x ):; return x[0]. # create an identity function; f = TF1('pyf1', identity, -1., 1.). # plot the function; c = TCanvas(); f.Draw(); ```. Because no number of parameters is given to the **`TF1`** constructor,; '`0`' (the default) is assumed. This way, the '`identity'` function need; not handle a second argument, which would normally be used to pass the; function parameters. Note that the argument '`x`' is an array of size 4.; The following is an example of a parameterized Python callable instance; that is plotted on a default canvas:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:25847,depend,depends,25847,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

This is possible only for vector up to size 10.; * Constructor from an iterator copying the data referred by the iterator. It is possible; to specify the _begin_ and _end_ of the iterator or the _begin_ and the size. Note that; for the Vector the iterator is not generic and must be of type _T*,_ where T is the type; of the contained elements. Here are some examples on how to create a vector. In the following we assume that we are; using the namespace ROOT::Math. ~~~ {.cpp}; SVector<double,N> v; // create a vector of size N, v[i]=0; SVector<double,3> v(1,2,3); // create a vector of size 3, v[0]=1,v[1]=2,v[2]=3; double a[9] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; // input data; SVector<double,9> v(a,9); // create a vector using the a[] data; ~~~. ### Accessing and Setting Methods. The single vector elements can be set or retrieved using the _operator[i]_ , _operator(i)_; or the iterator interface. Notice that the index starts from zero and not from one as in; FORTRAN. Also no check is performed on the passed index. Furthermore, all the matrix; elements can be set also by using the ROOT::SVector::SetElements function passing a generic; iterator. The elements can be accessed also by using the ROOT::Math::SVector::apply(i) function. ~~~ {.cpp}; v[0] = 1; // set the first element; v(1) = 2; // set the second element; *(v.begin()+3) = 3; // set the third element; // set vector elements from a std::vector<double>::iterator</double>; std::vector <double> w(3);; v.SetElements(w.begin(),w.end());. double x = m(i); // return the i-th element; x = m.apply(i); // return the i-th element; x = *(m.begin()+i); // return the i-th element; ~~~.

If the size of the the; sub-vector is larger than the vector size a static assert ( a compilation error) is produced. ~~~ {.cpp}; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/smatrix/doc/SVector.md:1515,interface,interface,1515,math/smatrix/doc/SVector.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/smatrix/doc/SVector.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly.

There is an integration for :program:`vim` which lets you run the; :program:`clang-format` standalone tool on your current buffer, optionally; selecting regions to reformat. The integration has the form of a `python`-file; which can be found under `clang/tools/clang-format/clang-format.py`. This can be integrated by adding the following to your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. if has('python'); map <C-K> :pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; elseif has('python3'); map <C-K> :py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; endif. The first line enables :program:`clang-format` for NORMAL and VISUAL mode, the; second line adds support for INSERT mode. Change ""C-K"" to another binding if; you need :program:`clang-format` on a different key (C-K stands for Ctrl+k). With this integration you can press the bound key and clang-format will; format the current line in NORMAL and INSERT mode or the selected region in; VISUAL mode. The line or region is extended to the next bigger syntactic; entity. It operates on the current, potentially unsaved buffer and does not create; or save any files. To revert a formatting, just undo. An alternative option is to format changes when saving a file and thus to; have a zero-effort integration into the coding workflow. To do this, add this to; your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. function! Formatonsave(); let l:formatdiff = 1; pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py; endfunction; autocmd BufWritePre *.h,*.cc,*.cpp call Formatonsave(). Emacs Integration; =================. Similar to the integration for :program:`vim`, there is an integration for; :program:`emacs`.

Integrability,"nals; =========================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. This document describes the Clang driver. The purpose of this document; is to describe both the motivation and design goals for the driver, as; well as details of the internal implementation. Features and Goals; ==================. The Clang driver is intended to be a production quality compiler driver; providing access to the Clang compiler and tools, with a command line; interface which is compatible with the gcc driver. Although the driver is part of and driven by the Clang project, it is; logically a separate tool which shares many of the same goals as Clang:. .. contents:: Features; :local:. GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:1082,interface,interface,1082,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

Significantly improves performance when creating many image files using web graphics. - Introduce `TCanvas::UpdateAsync` method. In case of web-based canvas triggers update of the canvas on the client side,; but does not wait that real update is completed. Avoids blocking of caller thread.; Have to be used if called from other web-based widget to avoid logical dead-locks.; In case of normal canvas just canvas->Update() is performed. - The Delaunay triangles (used by TGraph2D) were computed by the external package `triangle.c`; included in the ROOT distribution. This package had several issues:; - It was not maintained anymore.; - Its license was not compatible with LGPL; This code is now replaced by the [CDT package](https://github.com/artem-ogre/CDT) which is; properly maintained and has a license (MLP) compatible with LGPL. It will appear in 6.03.02. ## Machine Learning integration. - ROOT now offers functionality to extract batches of events out of a dataset for use in common ML training workflows. For example, one can generate PyTorch tensors from a TTree. The functionality is available through the `RBatchGenerator` class and can be seamlessly integrated in user code, for example:; ```python; # Returns two generators that return training and validation batches as PyTorch tensors.; gen_train, gen_validation = ROOT.TMVA.Experimental.CreatePyTorchGenerators(; tree_name, file_name, batch_size, chunk_size, target=target, validation_split=0.3); ```; The functionality is also available for TensorFlow datasets and Python generators of numpy arrays.

Integrability,"nce; All classes along with their derived and base classes are shown in the; Class Hierarchy.; The documentation for each class also shows the inheritance diagram.; The class hierarchy is meant to give an overview of available classes; and their relations. Modules; What they are; Classes are grouped into modules. For ROOT, this is done on a per-directory basis:; each module corresponds to a sub-directory. In other cases one module might represent; one library. Either way, modules are meant to combine similar or related classes,; allowing users to find classes close by context. If you need some functionality that; you cannot find in a class you know, you might want to check for classes in the same; module - maybe one of them does what you need. List of Modules; Modules are listed ontop of the Class Index and as part; of the Library Dependencies Chart. Modules' Library Dependencies; Each module is assumed to be part of a library. The dependencies of libraries are; not only relevant for linking, but often reflect also the contextual dependencies.; The dependencies of all modules are shown in the; Library Dependencies Chart. Class Reference; Pages like the one for TH2 are; class references. They document the use and functionality of a class. Sections; Each class reference page has a class documentation, which documents what the class; can be used for, and gives hints on how to use it. This allows you to figure out; whether a certain class is appropriate for what you try to do. The page then lists; all available members; they define a class's functionality and its interaction with; your code. The next item is a tabbed set of charts, which allow you to study the; class's inheritance diagram, what members get inherited from where, and which members; are re-implemented, which files get indirectly included by including the class's; header, and which libraries this class depends on.

Objective-C Features; ====================. Related result types; --------------------. According to Cocoa conventions, Objective-C methods with certain names; (""``init``"", ""``alloc``"", etc.) always return objects that are an instance of; the receiving class's type. Such methods are said to have a ""related result; type"", meaning that a message send to one of these methods will have the same; static type as an instance of the receiver class. For example, given the; following classes:. .. code-block:: objc. @interface NSObject; + (id)alloc;; - (id)init;; @end. @interface NSArray : NSObject; @end. and this common initialization pattern. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] init];. the type of the expression ``[NSArray alloc]`` is ``NSArray*`` because; ``alloc`` implicitly has a related result type. Similarly, the type of the; expression ``[[NSArray alloc] init]`` is ``NSArray*``, since ``init`` has a; related result type and its receiver is known to have the type ``NSArray *``.; If neither ``alloc`` nor ``init`` had a related result type, the expressions; would have had type ``id``, as declared in the method signature. A method with a related result type can be declared by using the type; ``instancetype`` as its result type. ``instancetype`` is a contextual keyword; that is only permitted in the result type of an Objective-C method, e.g. .. code-block:: objc. @interface A; + (instancetype)constructAnA;; @end.

Clang has the ability to generate compilation database fragments via; ``-MJ argument <clang -MJ\<arg>>``. You can concatenate those; fragments together between ``[`` and ``]`` to create a compilation database. Currently `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ (since 2.8.5) supports generation; of compilation databases for Unix Makefile builds (Ninja builds in the; works) with the option ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS``. For projects on Linux, there is an alternative to intercept compiler; calls with a tool called `Bear <https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>`_. `Bazel <https://bazel.build>`_ can export a compilation database via; `this extractor extension; <https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor>`_.; Bazel is otherwise resistant to Bear and other compiler-intercept; techniques. Clang's tooling interface supports reading compilation databases; see; the :doc:`LibTooling documentation <LibTooling>`. libclang and its; python bindings also support this (since clang 3.2); see; `CXCompilationDatabase.h </doxygen/group__COMPILATIONDB.html>`_. Format; ======. A compilation database is a JSON file, which consist of an array of; ""command objects"", where each command object specifies one way a; translation unit is compiled in the project. Each command object contains the translation unit's main file, the; working directory of the compile run and the actual compile command. Example:. ::.

Along the same lines, it is recommended to use RooAbsReal::createProfile() rather; than constructing a RooProfileLL object directly as the former will efficiently; recast a profile of a profile into a single profile object. Multivariate Gaussian modeling of parameters estimates from a fit; You can now construct a multivariate Gaussian p.d.f on the parameters of a model that; represents the result of a fit, from any RooFitResult object. RooAbsPdf* paramPdf = fitresult->createHessePdf(RooArgSet(a,b)) ;. The returned object is an instance of the newly added class RooMultiVarGaussian, that can; model correlated Gaussian distributions in an arbitrary number of dimensions, given a; vector of mean values and a covariance matrix. Class RooMultivarGaussian implements analytical; integration as well as analytical partial integrals over the first 31 dimensions (if you have; that many) and implements in effect internal generation strategy for its observables.

Users therefore had to resort; to; getattr(workspace, 'import')(...); Now,; workspace.Import(...); has been defined for the new PyROOT, which makes calling the function easier. ### Modernised category classes; RooFit's categories were modernised. Previously, the class RooCatType was used to store category states. It stores; two members, an integer for the category index, and up to 256 characters for a category name. Now, such states are; stored only using an integer, and category names can have arbitrary length. This will use 4 instead of 288 bytes; per category entry in a dataset, and make computations that rely on category states faster. The interface to define or manipulate category states was also updated. Since categories are mappings from state names; to state index, this is now reflected in the interface. Among others, this is now possible:; | ROOT 6.22 | Before (still supported) |; |------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|; | `RooCategory cat(""cat"", ""Lepton flavour"");` | `RooCategory cat(""cat"", ""Lepton flavour"");` |; | `cat[""electron""] = 1;` | `cat.defineType(""electron"", 1);` |; | `cat[""muon""] = 2;` | `cat.defineType(""muon"", 2);` |.

The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. #### Special case: Wrapping TF1 objects in Parametric Function interfaces. In many cases, the user works with the `TF1` class. The mathematical library in ROOT provides some solutions to wrap these into the interfaces needed by other methods.; If the desired interface to wrap is one-dimensional, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1`.; The default constructor takes a `TF1` reference as an argument, that will be wrapped with the interfaces of a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionOneDim`.; Example:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedTF1.h"". int main(); {. TF1 f(""Sin Function"", ""sin(x)+y"",0,3);. ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1 wf1(f);. cout << f(1) << endl;; cout << wf1(1) << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. For a TF1 defining a multidimensional function or in case we need to wrap in a multi-dimensional function interface, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1`.; Following the usual procedure, setting the `TF1` though the constructor, will wrap it into a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim`.; Example:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedMultiTF1.h"". int main(); {. TF2 f(""Sin Function"", ""sin(x) + y"",0,3,0,2);. ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 wf1(f);. double x[] = {1,2};. cout << f(x) << endl;; cout << wf1(x) << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. ## Numerical Integration.

To link an EXE, pass; ``-wholearchive:clang_rt.asan-x86_64.lib``. Windows System Headers and Library Lookup; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. clang-cl uses a set of different approaches to locate the right system libraries; to link against when building code. The Windows environment uses libraries from; three distinct sources:. 1. Windows SDK; 2. UCRT (Universal C Runtime); 3. Visual C++ Tools (VCRuntime). The Windows SDK provides the import libraries and headers required to build; programs against the Windows system packages. Underlying the Windows SDK is the; UCRT, the universal C runtime. This difference is best illustrated by the various headers that one would find; in the different categories. The WinSDK would contain headers such as; `WinSock2.h` which is part of the Windows API surface, providing the Windows; socketing interfaces for networking. UCRT provides the C library headers,; including e.g. `stdio.h`. Finally, the Visual C++ tools provides the underlying; Visual C++ Runtime headers such as `stdint.h` or `crtdefs.h`. There are various controls that allow the user control over where clang-cl will; locate these headers. The default behaviour for the Windows SDK and UCRT is as; follows:. 1. Consult the command line. Anything the user specifies is always given precedence. The following; extensions are part of the clang-cl toolset:. - `/winsysroot:`. The `/winsysroot:` is used as an equivalent to `-sysroot` on Unix; environments. It allows the control of an alternate location to be treated; as a system root. When specified, it will be used as the root where the; `Windows Kits` is located. - `/winsdkversion:`; - `/winsdkdir:`. If `/winsysroot:` is not specified, the `/winsdkdir:` argument is consulted; as a location to identify where the Windows SDK is located.

The full classification of a given; state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node; containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary; along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the; current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest; boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a; detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical; constraints. We will hereby describe the user interface of `TGeo` to access; tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for; simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an; external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface; for external trackers can be found in `$ROOTSYS/vmc` folder and it can; be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (\*) by using; directly a geometry described with %ROOT. The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into; TGeoManager class and implemented in the navigator class; TGeoNavigator.

Integrability,"nd is designed to; support a wide range of implementations and clients (but currently all clients; are assumed to be flow-insensitive). In addition to simple alias analysis; information, this class exposes Mod/Ref information from those implementations; which can provide it, allowing for powerful analyses and transformations to work; well together. This document contains information necessary to successfully implement this; interface, use it, and to test both sides. It also explains some of the finer; points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview; ================================. The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__; class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations; should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and; ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref; query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in; several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a; starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual; ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to; get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple; values, values which are not :ref:`constants <constants>` are all; defined within the same function. Representation of Pointers; --------------------------. Most importantly, the ``AliasAnalysis`` class provides several methods which are; used to query whether or not two memory objects alias, whether function calls; can modify or read a memory object, etc. For all of these queries, memory; objects are represented as a pair of their starting address (a symbolic LLVM; ``Value*``) and a static size.

Integrability,"nd nested tuple) is the experimental evolution of TTree columnar data storage. RNTuple introduces; new interfaces that aim to be more robust. In particular, the new interfaces are type-safe through the use of; templates, and the ownership is well-defined through the use of smart pointers. For instance. tree->Branch(""px"", &Category, ""px/F"");. becomes. auto px = model->MakeField<float>(""px"");; // px is std::shared_ptr<float>. The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:1219,interface,interfaces,1219,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']
Integrability,"nd stored** -- if necessary, the; target can select a ``G_LOAD``/``G_STORE`` of each gvreg operand. As opposed to SelectionDAG, there are no legalization phases. In particular,; 'type' and 'operation' legalization are not separate. Legalization is iterative, and all state is contained in GMIR. To maintain the; validity of the intermediate code, instructions are introduced:. * ``G_MERGE_VALUES`` --- concatenate multiple registers of the same; size into a single wider register. * ``G_UNMERGE_VALUES`` --- extract multiple registers of the same size; from a single wider register. * ``G_EXTRACT`` --- extract a simple register (as contiguous sequences of bits); from a single wider register. As they are expected to be temporary byproducts of the legalization process,; they are combined at the end of the :ref:`milegalizer` pass.; If any remain, they are expected to always be selectable, using loads and stores; if necessary. The legality of an instruction may only depend on the instruction itself and; must not depend on any context in which the instruction is used. However, after; deciding that an instruction is not legal, using the context of the instruction; to decide how to legalize the instruction is permitted. As an example, if we; have a ``G_FOO`` instruction of the form::. %1:_(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 1; %2:_(s32) = G_FOO %0:_(s32), %1:_(s32). it's impossible to say that G_FOO is legal iff %1 is a ``G_CONSTANT`` with; value ``1``. However, the following::. %2:_(s32) = G_FOO %0:_(s32), i32 1. can say that it's legal iff operand 2 is an immediate with value ``1`` because; that information is entirely contained within the single instruction. .. _api-legalizerinfo:.

In LLVM 15, opaque pointers are enabled by default, but it it still possible to; use typed pointers using a number of opt-in flags. For users of the clang driver interface, it is possible to temporarily restore; the old default using the ``-DCLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS=OFF`` cmake option,; or by passing ``-Xclang -no-opaque-pointers`` to a single clang invocation. For users of the clang cc1 interface, ``-no-opaque-pointers`` can be passed.; Note that the ``CLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS`` cmake option has no effect on; the cc1 interface. Usage for LTO can be disabled by passing ``-Wl,-plugin-opt=no-opaque-pointers``; to the clang driver.

Integrability,"nd, the ``--hip-link`` flag instructs Clang to link the HIP runtime library. However,; the use of this flag is unnecessary if a HIP input file is already present in your program. For convenience, Clang also supports compiling and linking in a single step:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample. In the above commands, ``gfx906`` is the GPU architecture that the code is being compiled for. The supported GPU; architectures can be found in the `AMDGPU Processor Table <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors>`_.; Alternatively, you can use the ``amdgpu-arch`` tool that comes with Clang to list the GPU architecture on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. amdgpu-arch. You can use ``--offload-arch=native`` to automatically detect the GPU architectures on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offload-arch=native -xhip sample.cpp -o sample. Path Setting for Dependencies; =============================. Compiling a HIP program depends on the HIP runtime and device library. The paths to the HIP runtime and device libraries; can be specified either using compiler options or environment variables. The paths can also be set through the ROCm path; if they follow the ROCm installation directory structure.

Introduction; ============. The LLVM target-independent code generator is a framework that provides a suite; of reusable components for translating the LLVM internal representation to the; machine code for a specified target---either in assembly form (suitable for a; static compiler) or in binary machine code format (usable for a JIT; compiler). The LLVM target-independent code generator consists of six main; components:. 1. `Abstract target description`_ interfaces which capture important properties; about various aspects of the machine, independently of how they will be used.; These interfaces are defined in ``include/llvm/Target/``. 2. Classes used to represent the `code being generated`_ for a target. These; classes are intended to be abstract enough to represent the machine code for; *any* target machine. These classes are defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/``. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" are explicitly exposed. 3. Classes and algorithms used to represent code at the object file level, the; `MC Layer`_. These classes represent assembly level constructs like labels,; sections, and instructions. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" don't exist. 4. `Target-independent algorithms`_ used to implement various phases of native; code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack frame representation,; etc). This code lives in ``lib/CodeGen/``. 5. `Implementations of the abstract target description interfaces`_ for; particular targets.

The variable argument portion of the ``foreach`` block can contain dereferenced; lists, values to iterate, or a mix of both:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var ${my_list}); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var ${my_list} out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds. There is also a more modern CMake foreach syntax. The code below is equivalent; to the code above:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var IN ITEMS foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var IN LISTS my_list ITEMS out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds.

Modules are CMake's vehicle for enabling code reuse. CMake modules are just; CMake script files. They can contain code to execute on include as well as; definitions for commands. In CMake macros and functions are universally referred to as commands, and they; are the primary method of defining code that can be called multiple times. In LLVM we have several CMake modules that are included as part of our; distribution for developers who don't build our project from source.

The class `ROOT::Math::GradFunctor` is used to wrap in a very C++ callable object to make gradient functions. It can be constructed in three different way:; * From an object implementing both `double operator()( const double * )` for the function evaluation and `double Derivative(const double *, int icoord)` for the partial derivatives.; * From an object implementing any member function like `Foo::XXX(const double *)` for the function evaluation and any member function like `Foo::XXX(const double *, int icoord)` for the partial derivatives.; * From an function object implementing `double operator()( const double * )` for the function evaluation and another function object implementing `double operator() (const double *, int icoord)`; for the partial derivatives. The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. #### Special case: Wrapping TF1 objects in Parametric Function interfaces. In many cases, the user works with the `TF1` class. The mathematical library in ROOT provides some solutions to wrap these into the interfaces needed by other methods.; If the desired interface to wrap is one-dimensional, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1`.; The default constructor takes a `TF1` reference as an argument, that will be wrapped with the interfaces of a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionOneDim`.; Example:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedTF1.h"". int main(); {. TF1 f(""Sin Function"", ""sin(x)+y"",0,3);. ROOT::Math::WrappedTF1 wf1(f);. cout << f(1) << endl;; cout << wf1(1) << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. For a TF1 defining a multidimensional function or in case we need to wrap in a multi-dimensional function interface, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1`.; Following the usual procedure, setting the `TF1` though the constructor, will wrap it into a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim`.; Exam",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:47012,interface,interfaces,47012,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']
Integrability,"ndles; ---------------. Operand bundles are tagged sets of SSA values that can be associated; with certain LLVM instructions (currently only ``call`` s and; ``invoke`` s). In a way they are like metadata, but dropping them is; incorrect and will change program semantics. Syntax::. operand bundle set ::= '[' operand bundle (, operand bundle )* ']'; operand bundle ::= tag '(' [ bundle operand ] (, bundle operand )* ')'; bundle operand ::= SSA value; tag ::= string constant. Operand bundles are **not** part of a function's signature, and a; given function may be called from multiple places with different kinds; of operand bundles. This reflects the fact that the operand bundles; are conceptually a part of the ``call`` (or ``invoke``), not the; callee being dispatched to. Operand bundles are a generic mechanism intended to support; runtime-introspection-like functionality for managed languages. While; the exact semantics of an operand bundle depend on the bundle tag,; there are certain limitations to how much the presence of an operand; bundle can influence the semantics of a program. These restrictions; are described as the semantics of an ""unknown"" operand bundle. As; long as the behavior of an operand bundle is describable within these; restrictions, LLVM does not need to have special knowledge of the; operand bundle to not miscompile programs containing it. - The bundle operands for an unknown operand bundle escape in unknown; ways before control is transferred to the callee or invokee.; - Calls and invokes with operand bundles have unknown read / write; effect on the heap on entry and exit (even if the call target specifies; a ``memory`` attribute), unless they're overridden with; callsite specific attributes.; - An operand bundle at a call site cannot change the implementation; of the called function. Inter-procedural optimizations work as; usual as long as they take into account the first two properties. More specific types of operand bundles are described below.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:117845,depend,depend,117845,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"nds are respected. The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if the; address is outside the actual underlying allocated object and not the address; one-past-the-end. Without the ``inbounds`` keyword, there are no restrictions on computing; out-of-bounds addresses. Obviously, performing a load or a store requires an; address of allocated and sufficiently aligned memory. But the GEP itself is only; concerned with computing addresses. Can array indices be negative?; ------------------------------. Yes. This is basically a special case of array indices being out of bounds. Can I compare two values computed with GEPs?; --------------------------------------------. Yes. If both addresses are within the same allocated object, or; one-past-the-end, you'll get the comparison result you expect. If either is; outside of it, integer arithmetic wrapping may occur, so the comparison may not; be meaningful. Can I do GEP with a different pointer type than the type of the underlying object?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes. There are no restrictions on bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------.

Integrability,"ne could imagine a module ``std`` covering the C standard library. Each of the C standard library headers (``<stdio.h>``, ``<stdlib.h>``, ``<math.h>``, etc.) would contribute to the ``std`` module, by placing their respective APIs into the corresponding submodule (``std.io``, ``std.lib``, ``std.math``, etc.). Having a list of the headers that are part of the ``std`` module allows the compiler to build the ``std`` module as a standalone entity, and having the mapping from header names to (sub)modules allows the automatic translation of ``#include`` directives to module imports. Module maps are specified as separate files (each named ``module.modulemap``) alongside the headers they describe, which allows them to be added to existing software libraries without having to change the library headers themselves (in most cases [#]_). The actual `Module map language`_ is described in a later section. .. note::. To actually see any benefits from modules, one first has to introduce module maps for the underlying C standard library and the libraries and headers on which it depends. The section `Modularizing a Platform`_ describes the steps one must take to write these module maps. One can use module maps without modules to check the integrity of the use of header files. To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:12722,depend,depends,12722,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

Compiling eagerly by default makes it; easy to use ORC as an in-memory compiler for an existing JIT (similar to how; MCJIT is commonly used). However ORC also provides built-in support for lazy; compilation via lazy-reexports (see :ref:`Laziness`). **Support for Custom Compilers and Program Representations**; Clients can supply custom compilers for each symbol that they define in their; JIT session. ORC will run the user-supplied compiler when the a definition of; a symbol is needed. ORC is actually fully language agnostic: LLVM IR is not; treated specially, and is supported via the same wrapper mechanism (the; ``MaterializationUnit`` class) that is used for custom compilers. **Concurrent JIT'd code** and **Concurrent Compilation**; JIT'd code may be executed in multiple threads, may spawn new threads, and may; re-enter the ORC (e.g. to request lazy compilation) concurrently from multiple; threads. Compilers launched my ORC can run concurrently (provided the client; sets up an appropriate dispatcher). Built-in dependency tracking ensures that; ORC does not release pointers to JIT'd code or data until all dependencies; have also been JIT'd and they are safe to call or use. **Removable Code**; Resources for JIT'd program representations. **Orthogonality** and **Composability**; Each of the features above can be used independently.

Later values are determined by M as it; searches for the minimum or performs whatever analysis is requested by; the user. ### FCNBase::up() ###.

By default first derivatives are calculated numerically by M . In case; the user wants to supply their own gradient calculator (e.g. analytical; derivatives), they need to implement the FCNGradientBase interface. ![](figures/fcngradientbase.png).

In case all ``-fprebuilt-module-path=<path/to/directory>``, ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` and; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` exist, the ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` option; takes highest precedence and ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will take the second; highest precedence. We need to specify all the dependent (directly and indirectly) BMIs.; See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/62707 for detail. When we compile a ``module implementation unit``, we must specify the BMI of the corresponding; ``primary module interface unit``.; Since the language specification says a module implementation unit implicitly imports; the primary module interface unit. [module.unit]p8. A module-declaration that contains neither an export-keyword nor a module-partition implicitly; imports the primary module interface unit of the module as if by a module-import-declaration. All of the 3 options ``-fprebuilt-module-path=<path/to/directory>``, ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>``; and ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` may occur multiple times.; For example, the command line to compile ``M.cppm`` in; the above example could be rewritten into:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 M.cppm --precompile -fmodule-file=M:interface_part=M-interface_part.pcm -fmodule-file=M:impl_part=M-impl_part.pcm -o M.pcm.

Integrability,"ned multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:84535,depend,depend,84535,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"need the header file. If you are simply returning a class instance from a; prototyped function or method, you don't need it. In fact, for most cases, you; simply don't need the definition of a class. And not ``#include``\ing speeds up; compilation. It is easy to try to go too overboard on this recommendation, however. You; **must** include all of the header files that you are using --- you can include; them either directly or indirectly through another header file. To make sure; that you don't accidentally forget to include a header file in your module; header, make sure to include your module header **first** in the implementation; file (as mentioned above). This way there won't be any hidden dependencies that; you'll find out about later. Keep ""Internal"" Headers Private; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Many modules have a complex implementation that causes them to use more than one; implementation (``.cpp``) file. It is often tempting to put the internal; communication interface (helper classes, extra functions, etc) in the public; module header file. Don't do this!. If you really need to do something like this, put a private header file in the; same directory as the source files, and include it locally. This ensures that; your private interface remains private and undisturbed by outsiders. .. note::. It's okay to put extra implementation methods in a public class itself. Just; make them private (or protected) and all is well. Use Namespace Qualifiers to Implement Previously Declared Functions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When providing an out of line implementation of a function in a source file, do; not open namespace blocks in the source file. Instead, use namespace qualifiers; to help ensure that your definition matches an existing declaration.

When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that representation directly. Thus, a module's headers will only be parsed once per language configuration, rather than once per translation unit that uses the module. Modules maintain references to each of the headers that were part of the module build. If any of those headers changes, or if any of the modules on which a module depends change, then the module will be (automatically) recompiled. The process should never require any user intervention.

This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer.

New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed.

It is treated identically to a normal ``CHECK``; directive except that FileCheck makes an additional assumption that a line; matched by the directive cannot also be matched by any other check present in; ``match-filename``; this is intended to be used for lines containing labels or; other unique identifiers. Conceptually, the presence of ``CHECK-LABEL`` divides; the input stream into separate blocks, each of which is processed independently,; preventing a ``CHECK:`` directive in one block matching a line in another block.; If ``--enable-var-scope`` is in effect, all local variables are cleared at the; beginning of the block.

For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23592,adapter,adapter,23592,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['adapter'],['adapter']

For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime. There are also uncommon enough to make it; reasonable to require the precise-lifetime annotation if someone; really wants to rely on them. Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the chance to operate on the value, e.g. to retain it, before; ARC releases the original pointer.

This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an obje",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:82244,depend,dependence,82244,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['depend'],['dependence']

You can also; instrument just a sampled subset of functions using instrumentation groups.; For example, to instrument only a quarter of available functions invoke:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument -fxray-function-groups=4. A subset will be chosen arbitrarily based on a hash of the function name. To sample a; different subset you can specify ``-fxray-selected-function-group=`` with a group number; in the range of 0 to ``xray-function-groups`` - 1.

This; implies:. - do not share the layout-hints among GUI components;. - do not delete child widgets in the destructor as this is done; automatically. #### Using Several Tabs.

Tabs must be created from the constructor of your; editor-class by using the method:. ``` {.cpp}; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; ```. It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your; class. If you need to hide/show this frame depending on the object's; status, you should store it in a data member. See for examples:; **`TH1Editor`**, **`TH2Editor`**. #### Base-Class Editors Control. Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing; virtual method void `TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass` `*cl)`.; It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default; implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing; mechanism.

Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in **`TGedFrame`**‘s; data-member:. ``` {.cpp}; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; ```. Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in; the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of; **`TGedFrame`**'s data member `Int_t fPriority`.

The *module-id* of the *conflict-declaration* specifies the module with which the enclosing module conflicts.

The *string-literal* provides a message to be provided as part of the compiler diagnostic when two modules conflict. .. note::. Clang emits a warning (under the control of ``-Wmodule-conflict``); when a module conflict is discovered. **Example:**. .. parsed-literal::. module Conflicts {; explicit module A {; header ""conflict_a.h""; conflict B, ""we just don't like B""; }. module B {; header ""conflict_b.h""; }; }.

They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store.

It is conventional,; but not required, for an ``init`` method to return ``self``. It is undefined behavior for a program to cause two or more calls to ``init``; methods on the same object, except that each ``init`` method invocation may; perform at most one delegate init call. .. _arc.family.semantics.result_type:. Related result types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Certain methods are candidates to have :arc-term:`related result types`:. * class methods in the ``alloc`` and ``new`` method families; * instance methods in the ``init`` family; * the instance method ``self``; * outside of ARC, the instance methods ``retain`` and ``autorelease``. If the formal result type of such a method is ``id`` or protocol-qualified; ``id``, or a type equal to the declaring class or a superclass, then it is said; to have a related result type. In this case, when invoked in an explicit; message send, it is assumed to return a type related to the type of the; receiver:. * if it is a class method, and the receiver is a class name ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T*``; otherwise; * if it is an instance method, and the receiver has type ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T``; otherwise; * the message send expression has the normal result type of the method. This is a new rule of the Objective-C language and applies outside of ARC. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC's automatic code emission is more prone than most code to signature; errors, i.e. errors where a call was emitted against one method signature,; but the implementing method has an incompatible signature.

The goal of this; design is to capture the semantic details of HLSL function calls in the AST, and; minimize the amount of magic that needs to occur during IR generation.

Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation. Even more includes will be ""hidden"" when ROOT configured with `-Ddev=ON` build option.; In that case ROOT uses `#ifdef R__LESS_INCLUDES` to replace unused includes by class forward declarations.; Such `dev` builds can be used to verify that ROOT-based code really includes all necessary ROOT headers. ## RDataFrame. - Starting from this version, when `RSnapshotOptions.fMode` is `""UPDATE""` (i.e. the output file is opened in ""UPDATE""; mode), Snapshot will refuse to write out a TTree if one with the same name is already present in the output file.; Users can set the new flag `RSnapshotOption::fOverwriteIfExists` to `true` to force the deletion of the TTree that is; already present and the writing of a new TTree with the same name.

Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view. Our goal is to take advantage of tight; integration between the linker and the optimizer by sharing this information; during various linking phases. Phase 1 : Read LLVM Bitcode Files; ---------------------------------. The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the share",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:5328,integrat,integration,5328,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Override RooAbsArg::translate(). **translate() Example 1:** Continuing our RooPoisson example:. To translate the `RooPoisson` class, create a translate function and in it; include a call to the updated function. ``` {.cpp}; void RooPoisson::translate(RooFit::Detail::RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext &ctx) const; {; std::string xName = ctx.getResult(x);; if (!_noRounding); xName = ""std::floor("" + xName + "")"";; ctx.addResult(this, ctx.buildCall(""RooFit::Detail::MathFuncs::poissonEvaluate"", xName, mean));; }; ```. Here we can see that the name of the variable `x` (remember that ""x"" is a; member of RooPoisson) is retrieved and stored in the `xName` variable. Next,; there's an `if` condition that does an operation on `x` (may or may not round; it to the nearest integer, depending on the condition). The important part is where the `RooPoisson::addResult()` function helps add; the result of evaluating the Poisson function to the context (`ctx`). It uses; the `RooPoisson::buildCall()` method to construct a function call to the fully; qualified name of `MathFuncs::poissonEvaluate` (which now resides in the; `MathFuncs` file), with arguments `xName` and `mean`. Essentially, the `RooPoisson::translate()` function constructs a function call; to evaluate the Poisson function using 'x' and 'mean' variables, and adds the; result to the context. Helper Functions:. - `getResult()` helps lookup the result of a child node (the string that the; child node previously saved in a variable using the `addResult()` function). - `addResult()` It may include a function call, an expression, or something; more complicated.

When ``sizeof()`` takes a type name, the compiler doesn't apply an implicit; bounds annotation on the named pointer types.

Integrability,"node.; It is also possible to combine some atomic nodes that have a simple; def-use dependency between them into larger nodes that contain multiple-; instructions. As described in [1]_ the DDG uses graph abstraction to group nodes; that are part of a strongly connected component of the graph; into special nodes called pi-blocks. pi-blocks represent cycles of data; dependency that prevent reordering transformations. Since any strongly; connected component of the graph is a maximal subgraph of all the nodes; that form a cycle, pi-blocks are at most one level deep. In other words,; no pi-blocks are nested inside another pi-block, resulting in a; hierarchical representation that is at most one level deep. For example, consider the following:. .. code-block:: c++. for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {; b[i] = c[i] + b[i-1];; }. This code contains a statement that has a loop carried dependence on; itself creating a cycle in the DDG. The figure below illustrates; how the cycle of dependency is carried through multiple def-use relations; and a memory access dependency. .. image:: cycle.png.

Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture.

In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events.

Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X. These 'X-Y' chi-squared fits are interfaced through newly added method; RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataSet&,...). By default the event weight is; interpreted as the 'Y' value, but an YVar() argument can designate any other; dataset column as Y value.

When calling the `Minuit`; functions such as `mncont`, `mnscan`, or any `Minuit` command; invoking `mnplot`, `TMinuit::mnplot()` produces a **`TGraph`**; object pointed by `fPlot`. One can retrieve this object with; **`TMinuit`**`::GetPlot().` For example:. ``` {.cpp}; h->Fit(""gaus"");; gMinuit->Command(""SCAn 1"");; TGraph *gr = (TGraph*)gMinuit->GetPlot();; gr->SetMarkerStyle(21);; gr->Draw(""alp"");; ```. - To set `Minuit` in no graphics mode, call. ``` {.cpp}; gMinuit->SetGraphicsMode(kFALSE);; ```. ### Basic Concepts of Minuit. The `Minuit` package acts on a multi parameter FORTRAN function to; which one must give the generic name `FCN`. In the ROOT; implementation, the function `FCN` is defined via the `Minuit`; `SetFCN` member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The; value of `FCN` will in general depend on one or more variable; parameters. ### The Transformation of Limited Parameters. For variable parameters with limits, `Minuit` uses the following; transformation:. `Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1) `. `Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1)`. so that the internal value `Pint` can take on any value, while the; external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a; and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily; non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty; non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if; not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some; computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more; importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the; problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation; of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off; both become more important as the external value gets closer t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:55342,depend,depend,55342,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"ns to run. In LLVM, execution resumes at a ``landingpad``; instruction, which produces register values provided by the runtime. If a; function is only cleaning up allocated resources, the function is responsible; for calling ``_Unwind_Resume`` to transition to the next most recently active; frame after it is finished cleaning up. Eventually, the frame responsible for; handling the exception calls ``__cxa_end_catch`` to destroy the exception,; release its memory, and resume normal control flow. The Windows EH model does not use these successive register context resets.; Instead, the active exception is typically described by a frame on the stack.; In the case of C++ exceptions, the exception object is allocated in stack memory; and its address is passed to ``__CxxThrowException``. General purpose structured; exceptions (SEH) are more analogous to Linux signals, and they are dispatched by; userspace DLLs provided with Windows. Each frame on the stack has an assigned EH; personality routine, which decides what actions to take to handle the exception.; There are a few major personalities for C and C++ code: the C++ personality; (``__CxxFrameHandler3``) and the SEH personalities (``_except_handler3``,; ``_except_handler4``, and ``__C_specific_handler``). All of them implement; cleanups by calling back into a ""funclet"" contained in the parent function. Funclets, in this context, are regions of the parent function that can be called; as though they were a function pointer with a very special calling convention.; The frame pointer of the parent frame is passed into the funclet either using; the standard EBP register or as the first parameter register, depending on the; architecture. The funclet implements the EH action by accessing local variables; in memory through the frame pointer, and returning some appropriate value,; continuing the EH process.

Instances of this kind of fallible iterator interface are then wrapped with the; fallible_iterator utility which provides ``operator++`` and ``operator--``,; returning any errors via a reference passed in to the wrapper at construction; time. The fallible_iterator wrapper takes care of (a) jumping to the end of the; range on error, and (b) marking the error as checked whenever an iterator is; compared to ``end`` and found to be inequal (in particular: this marks the; error as checked throughout the body of a range-based for loop), enabling early; exit from the loop without redundant error checking.

RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2.

Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system.

ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process. For instance,; if we used the regular ``DeclContext::lookup()`` to find the existing; declarations in the ""to"" context then the ``lookup()`` call itself would; initiate a new import while we are in the middle of importing a declaration!; (By the time we initiate the lookup we haven't registered yet that ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:107200,interface,interface,107200,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"nstant`` location or in the constant; pool, referred to by ``ConstantIndex`` locations. At each callsite, a ""liveout"" register list is also recorded. These; are the registers that are live across the stackmap and therefore must; be saved by the runtime. This is an important optimization when the; patchpoint intrinsic is used with a calling convention that by default; preserves most registers as callee-save. Each entry in the liveout register list contains a DWARF register; number and size in bytes. The stackmap format deliberately omits; specific subregister information. Instead the runtime must interpret; this information conservatively. For example, if the stackmap reports; one byte at ``%rax``, then the value may be in either ``%al`` or; ``%ah``. It doesn't matter in practice, because the runtime will; simply save ``%rax``. However, if the stackmap reports 16 bytes at; ``%ymm0``, then the runtime can safely optimize by saving only; ``%xmm0``. The stack map format is a contract between an LLVM SVN revision and; the runtime. It is currently experimental and may change in the short; term, but minimizing the need to update the runtime is; important. Consequently, the stack map design is motivated by; simplicity and extensibility. Compactness of the representation is; secondary because the runtime is expected to parse the data; immediately after compiling a module and encode the information in its; own format. Since the runtime controls the allocation of sections, it; can reuse the same stack map space for multiple modules. Stackmap support is currently only implemented for 64-bit; platforms. However, a 32-bit implementation should be able to use the; same format with an insignificant amount of wasted space. .. _stackmap-section:. Stack Map Section; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Integrability,"nt functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------. The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Support`` interfaces. Use Standard C++ Headers; ------------------------. The **standard** C++ headers from the standard C++ library and standard; template library may be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These; headers and the things they declare are considered to be platform agnostic.; LLVM source files may include them or obtain their inclusion through; ``lib/Support`` interfaces. High Level Interface; --------------------. The entry points specified in the interface of ``lib/Support`` must be aimed at; completing some reasonably high level task needed by LLVM. We do not want to; simply wrap each operating system call. It would be preferable to wrap several; operating system calls that are always used in conjunction with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:3506,interface,interfaces,3506,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['interface'],['interfaces']
Integrability,"nt mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fldcww"", ""fldcw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fucompi"", ""fucomip"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""ud2a"", ""ud2"">;. ... and many others. With a MnemonicAlias definition, the mnemonic is remapped; simply and directly. Though MnemonicAlias's can't look at any aspect of the; instruction (such as the operands) they can depend on global modes (the same; ones supported by the matcher), through a Requires clause:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfq"">, Requires<[In64BitMode]>;; def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfl"">, Requires<[In32BitMode]>;. In this example, the mnemonic gets mapped into a different one depending on; the current instruction set. Instruction Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The most general phase of alias processing occurs while matching is happening:; it provides new forms for the matcher to match along with a specific instruction; to generate. An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate. For example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rr8W GR16:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rm8W GR16:$dst, i8mem:$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr8 GR32:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr16 GR32:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr8 GR64:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr16 GR64:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr32 GR64:$dst, GR32 :$src)>;.

The most generic case of a multidimensional function has similar approach. Some examples will be shown next. It is important to notice, that one dimensional functions can be also implemented through; the interfaces that will be presented here. Nevertheless, the user needs to implement those following the indications of the previous chapter, for algorithm working exclusivly on one-dimensional; functions. For algorithms working on both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional functions they should instead use this interface. * `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`: This interface provides the `double operator() (const double*)` that takes an array of doubles with all the values for the different dimensions. In this case,; the user has to provide the functionality for two different functions: `double DoEval(const double*)` and `unsigned int NDim()`. The first ones evaluates the function given the array that represents; the multiple variables. The second returns the number of dimensions of the function. Example of implementing a basic multi-dimensional function:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim; {; public:; double DoEval(const double* x) const; {; return x[0] + sin(x[1]);; }. unsigned int NDim() const; {; return 2;; }.

Integrability,"nt to describe. The instance variables for an ARC-compiled class will be destroyed at some; point after control enters the ``dealloc`` method for the root class of the; class. The ordering of the destruction of instance variables is unspecified,; both within a single class and between subclasses and superclasses. .. admonition:: Rationale. The traditional, non-ARC pattern for destroying instance variables is to; destroy them immediately before calling ``[super dealloc]``. Unfortunately,; message sends from the superclass are quite capable of reaching methods in; the subclass, and those methods may well read or write to those instance; variables. Making such message sends from dealloc is generally discouraged,; since the subclass may well rely on other invariants that were broken during; ``dealloc``, but it's not so inescapably dangerous that we felt comfortable; calling it undefined behavior. Therefore we chose to delay destroying the; instance variables to a point at which message sends are clearly disallowed:; the point at which the root class's deallocation routines take over. In most code, the difference is not observable. It can, however, be observed; if an instance variable holds a strong reference to an object whose; deallocation will trigger a side-effect which must be carefully ordered with; respect to the destruction of the super class. Such code violates the design; principle that semantically important behavior should be explicit. A simple; fix is to clear the instance variable manually during ``dealloc``; a more; holistic solution is to move semantically important side-effects out of; ``dealloc`` and into a separate teardown phase which can rely on working with; well-formed objects. .. _arc.misc.autoreleasepool:. ``@autoreleasepool``; --------------------.

Integrability,"nt() method should allocate space for one; more element (using default constructor if element is a C++ object) and returns; a reference to that new allocated space. Flow Sequence; -------------; A YAML ""flow sequence"" is a sequence that when written to YAML it uses the; inline notation (e.g [ foo, bar ] ). To specify that a sequence type should; be written in YAML as a flow sequence, your SequenceTraits specialization should; add ""static const bool flow = true;"". For instance:. .. code-block:: c++. template <>; struct SequenceTraits<MyList> {; static size_t size(IO &io, MyList &list) { ... }; static MyListEl &element(IO &io, MyList &list, size_t index) { ... }. // The existence of this member causes YAML I/O to use a flow sequence; static const bool flow = true;; };. With the above, if you used MyList as the data type in your native data; structures, then when converted to YAML, a flow sequence of integers; will be used (e.g. [ 10, -3, 4 ]). Flow sequences are subject to line wrapping according to the Output object; configuration. Utility Macros; --------------; Since a common source of sequences is std::vector<>, YAML I/O provides macros:; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() and LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() which; can be used to easily specify SequenceTraits<> on a std::vector type. YAML; I/O does not partial specialize SequenceTraits on std::vector<> because that; would force all vectors to be sequences. An example use of the macros:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<MyType1>;; std::vector<MyType2>;; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType1); LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType2).

Integrability,"ntation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count. Using this information, ``ConstraintElimination`` is able; to determine ``p + count`` doesn’t wrap.; * Accordingly, ``p + i`` and ``p + i + 1`` also don’t wrap.; * Therefore, ``p <= p + i`` and ``p + i + 1 <= p + count``.; * The if-condition simplifies to false and becomes dead code that the subsequent; optimization passes can remove. ``OptRemarks`` can be utilized to provide insights into performance tuning. It; has the capability to report on checks that it cannot eliminate, possibly with; reasons, allowing programmers to adjust their code to unlock further; optimizations.

(A) Attributes are part of the formal interface of a function, and should; always go in the header, where they are visible to anything that includes; the header. Attributes in the .cpp file are not visible outside of the; immediate translation unit, which leads to false negatives and false positives.

The control parameters for the integration algorithms can be specified using the; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions` class. Static methods are provided to change the default values.; It is possible to print the list of default control parameters using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions::Print` function.; Example:; ```{.cpp}; ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions opt;; opt.Print();; Integrator Type : ADAPTIVE; Absolute tolerance : 1e-09; Relative tolerance : 1e-09; Workspace size : 100000; (max) function calls : 100000; ```; Depending on the algorithm, some of the control parameters might have no effect. #### `ROOT::Math::AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim`. This class implements an adaptive quadrature integration method for multi dimensional functions. It is described in this paper; *Genz, A.A. Malik, An adaptive algorithm for numerical integration over an N-dimensional rectangular region, J. Comput. Appl.

Integrability,"ntegrators will be migrated to; a MathCore implementation. Interface to TFoam adaptive MC sampler added; RooFit can now use the TFoam adaptive MC sampler for event generation of p.d.f.s that; do not have an internal generator. The TFoam generator adaptively subdivides the; observable space and is generally more efficient both warmup and generation than the original; RooAcceptReject algorithm. In its current interface in RooFit, TFoam cannot; handle problems yet with discrete observables or conditional observables. For those problems; the original RooAcceptReject generator is still used. The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class RooNumGenConfig, which; is similar in style and structure, to RooNumIntConfig which configures the choice of; numeric integration algorithm. A new tutorial macro rf902_numgenconfig.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of the steering. A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the; end of the RooFit section of the release notes. Optional persistent caching of numeric integrals; For p.d.f.s with numeric integrals that remain difficult or very time consuming,; a new persistent caching technique is now available that allows to precalculate; these integrals and store their values for future use. This technique works transparently; for any p.d.f. stored in a RooWorkspace. One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters. A new tutorial macro rf903_numintcache.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of this feature.

The biggest application of the memory-safe interfaces is to spot memory leaks; in RooFit-based frameworks. If you make sure that your framework compiles both; with and without `ROOFIT_MEMORY_SAFE_INTERFACES`, you can get rid of all memory; leaks related to RooFit user error! After making the necessary changes, you can; remove the marco definition again to keep backwards compatibility. Note that the memory-safe interfaces might become the default at some point, so; doing this **backwards-compatible migration early** is strongly encouraged and; appreciated. ### Removal of some memory-unsafe interfaces. * The final `bool takeOwnership` parameter of the **RooAddition** and; **RooStats::HistFactory::PiecewiseInterpolation** constructors was removed.; This is to avoid situations where ownership is not clear to the compiler.; Now, ownership of the input RooAbsArgs is never passed in the constructor.

Integrability,"nterface of ``lib/Support`` must be aimed at; completing some reasonably high level task needed by LLVM. We do not want to; simply wrap each operating system call. It would be preferable to wrap several; operating system calls that are always used in conjunction with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and ``wait``. The; correct thing for ``lib/Support`` to provide is a function, say; ``ExecuteProgramAndWait``, that implements the functionality completely. what; we don't want is wrappers for the operating system calls involved. There must **not** be a one-to-one relationship between operating system; calls and the Support library's interface. Any such interface function will be; suspicious. No Unused Functionality; -----------------------. There must be no functionality specified in the interface of ``lib/Support``; that isn't actually used by LLVM. We're not writing a general purpose operating; system wrapper here, just enough to satisfy LLVM's needs. And, LLVM doesn't; need much. This design goal aims to keep the ``lib/Support`` interface small and; understandable which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems supported for a given class of operating system (e.g. Unix, Win32). No Virtual Methods; ------------------. The Support Library interfaces can be called quite frequently by LLVM. In order; to make those calls as efficient as possible, we discourage the use of virtual; methods.

Integrability,"nterface which provides the user with more functionality; such as interaction with parameters. The core of the minimization functionality and related tools (the kernel; of M ) should be clearly separated from the user, who is interfacing via; defined user interfaces (the API). ## Internal and external parameters ##. Each of the parameters to the $\mbox{FCN}$ is defined by the user as; belonging to one of the following types:. - Freely variable: allowed to take on any value. - Variable with double sided limits: allowed to vary only between two; limits specified by the user. - Variable with single sided limits: allowed to vary only between one; upper or one lower limit specified by the user and unlimited to the; other side. - Fixed: originally defined as variable, but now taking on only the; value the parameter had at the moment it was fixed, or a value later; assigned by the user. - Constant: taking on only one value as specified by the user. When using the minimal required interface, all variable parameters are; free and unbound. The user, in their $\mbox{FCN}$, must of course be able to ""see"" all; types of defined parameters, and they therefore have access to what we call; the *external parameter list*, that is, the parameters as he defined; them. On the other hand, the internal M minimizing routines only want to; ""see"" variable parameters without limits, and so they have access only; to the *internal parameter list* which is created from the external list; by the following transformation:. - Squeeze out all parameters that are not variable. - Transform all variable parameters with limits, so that the; transformed parameter can vary without limits. (See the next section; for details concerning this transformation.) Because this; transformation is non-linear, it is recommended to avoid putting; limits on parameters where they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely va",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:5699,interface,interface,5699,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"ntics, and these types nest; strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen in the ``Value``; or ``Type`` type hierarchies. A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of; polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be modeled with; virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract interface base class; which all implementations derive from and override. However, this; implementation strategy forces an **""is-a""** relationship to exist that is not; actually meaningful. There is often not some nested hierarchy of useful; generalizations which code might interact with and move up and down. Instead,; there is a singular interface which is dispatched across a range of; implementations. The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of; generic programming (sometimes called ""compile-time duck typing"" or ""static; polymorphism""). For example, a template over some type parameter ``T`` can be; instantiated across any particular implementation that conforms to the; interface or *concept*. A good example here is the highly generic properties of; any type which models a node in a directed graph. LLVM models these primarily; through templates and generic programming. Such templates include the; ``LoopInfoBase`` and ``DominatorTreeBase``. When this type of polymorphism; truly needs **dynamic** dispatch you can generalize it using a technique; called *concept-based polymorphism*. This pattern emulates the interfaces and; behaviors of templates using a very limited form of virtual dispatch for type; erasure inside its implementation. You can find examples of this technique in; the ``PassManager.h`` system, and there is a more detailed introduction to it; by Sean Parent in several of his talks and papers:. #. `Inheritance Is The Base Class of Evil; <http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Inheritance-Is-The-Base-Class-of-Evil>`_; - The GoingNative 2013 talk describing this technique, and p",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:130316,interface,interface,130316,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

For example, your method may — for reasons of backward; compatibility — chose to return nil and log an error message in a method; with a non-null return type when the client violated a documented precondition; rather than check the precondition with NSAssert(). In these cases, you; can suppress the analyzer warning with a cast:. return (id _Nonnull)nil;. Note that this cast does not affect code generation. Q: The analyzer assumes that a loop body is never entered. How can I tell it that the loop body will be entered at least once?. In the contrived example above, the analyzer has detected that the body of; the loop is never entered for the case where length <= 0. In this; particular example, you may know that the loop will always be entered because; the input parameter length will be greater than zero in all calls to this; function. You can teach the analyzer facts about your code as well as document; it by using assertions.

For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are. For example, those marked `CURRENT GUESS ERROR` are; only working values not to be believed, and `APPROXIMATE ERROR` means; that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that; they may not be accurate. If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled.

Integrability,"ny invalid constructs in class templates that Clang has; historically rejected. In order to parse widely distributed headers for; libraries such as the Active Template Library (ATL) and Windows Runtime Library; (WRL), some template rules have been relaxed or extended in Clang on Windows. The first major semantic difference is that MSVC appears to defer all parsing; an analysis of inline method bodies in class templates until instantiation; time. By default on Windows, Clang attempts to follow suit. This behavior is; controlled by the ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` flag. While Clang delays; parsing of method bodies, it still parses the bodies *before* template argument; substitution, which is not what MSVC does. The following compatibility tweaks; are necessary to parse the template in those cases. MSVC allows some name lookup into dependent base classes. Even on other; platforms, this has been a `frequently asked question`_ for Clang users. A; dependent base class is a base class that depends on the value of a template; parameter. Clang cannot see any of the names inside dependent bases while it; is parsing your template, so the user is sometimes required to use the; ``typename`` keyword to assist the parser. On Windows, Clang attempts to; follow the normal lookup rules, but if lookup fails, it will assume that the; user intended to find the name in a dependent base. While parsing the; following program, Clang will recover as if the user had written the; commented-out code:. .. _frequently asked question:; https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct Foo : T {; void f() {; /*typename*/ T::UnknownType x = /*this->*/unknownMember;; }; };. After recovery, Clang warns the user that this code is non-standard and issues; a hint suggesting how to fix the problem. As of this writing, Clang is able to compile a simple ATL hello world; application.

Thus, P is in the set (C-H), and there; must be a smaller cycle C' in C which also contains P, but that; contradicts how we chose C. 3. If a closed path P contains nodes U1 and U2 but not their; dominators D1 and D2 respectively, then there exists a cycle C that; contains U1 and U2 but neither of D1 and D2. **Proof:** From the above properties, each D1 and D2 separately; dominate every node in P. There exists a cycle C1 (respectively,; C2) that contains P but not D1 (respectively, D2).

Since ``H`` is the only entry to ``P``,; ``H`` must be the header of ``C'``.

Integrability,"o TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them. Instruction naming; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An instruction name consists of the base name, a default operand size, and a; character per operand with an optional special size. For example:. ::.

The; example below shows an instance of the X86 ``MOV32ri`` instruction that has an; immediate machine operand ``-42``:. .. code-block:: text. $eax = MOV32ri -42. An immediate operand is also used to represent a subregister index when the; machine instruction has one of the following opcodes:. - ``EXTRACT_SUBREG``. - ``INSERT_SUBREG``. - ``REG_SEQUENCE``. - ``SUBREG_TO_REG``. In case this is true, the Machine Operand is printed according to the target. For example:. In AArch64RegisterInfo.td:. .. code-block:: text. def sub_32 : SubRegIndex<32>;. If the third operand is an immediate with the value ``15`` (target-dependent; value), based on the instruction's opcode and the operand's index the operand; will be printed as ``%subreg.sub_32``:. .. code-block:: text. %1:gpr64 = SUBREG_TO_REG 0, %0, %subreg.sub_32. For integers > 64bit, we use a special machine operand, ``MO_CImmediate``,; which stores the immediate in a ``ConstantInt`` using an ``APInt`` (LLVM's; arbitrary precision integers). ..

Please note that Clang does not and will not support all of the GCC builtins; for vector operations. Instead of using builtins, you should use the functions; defined in target-specific header files like ``<xmmintrin.h>``, which define; portable wrappers for these.

Using the ``AliasSetTracker`` class; -----------------------------------. Many transformations need information about alias **sets** that are active in; some scope, rather than information about pairwise aliasing. The; `AliasSetTracker <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasSetTracker.html>`__; class is used to efficiently build these Alias Sets from the pairwise alias; analysis information provided by the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface. First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in. Once all of the alias sets are completed, your pass should; simply iterate through the constructed alias sets, using the ``AliasSetTracker``; ``begin()``/``end()`` methods. The ``AliasSet``\s formed by the ``AliasSetTracker`` are guaranteed to be; disjoint, calculate mod/ref information and volatility for the set, and keep; track of whether or not all of the pointers in the set are Must aliases. The; AliasSetTracker also makes sure that sets are properly folded due to call; instructions, and can provide a list of pointers in each set. As an example user of this, the `Loop Invariant Code Motion; <doxygen/structLICM.html>`_ pass uses ``AliasSetTracker``\s to calculate alias; sets for each loop nest.

The signals/slot communication mechanism is an advanced object; communication concept; it largely replaces the concept of callback; functions to handle actions in GUI's. Signals and slots are just like; any object-oriented methods implemented in C++. The objects are the; instances of classes that don't know anything about each other. They; interact and allow method calls of other object's methods. The idea is; simple: any object can send out (emit) a signal in certain situations; saying that something happened. This is all it does to communicate and; it does not know whether anything is interested in this information. On; the other side there might be an object waiting for that signal and; ready to react to it. This object disposes of special instruments to; listen to the sent out signals. To have a communication we need a; message transmission between the objects. In this simple example we use; signals and slots. The code of the method **`TGButton::Clicked()`** is:. ``` {.cpp}; virtual void Clicked() { Emit(""Clicked()""); } // *SIGNAL*; ```. I.e. any button emits the signal `Clicked()` any time someone clicks on; it. As you can see this method is virtual and could be overridden if you; need to. In our simple example we call the `Connect()` method to connect; the `Clicked()` signal of Draw button with `MyMainFrame::DoDraw():`. ``` {.cpp}; draw->Connect(""Clicked()"",""MyMainFrame"",this,""DoDraw()"");; ```. In the same way we can connect to the signal `Clicked()` of the Exit; button with the system call `gApplication->Terminate(0).` We declare a; new slot `DoExit(),` implement it to invoke the termination call and; associate this slot with the signal `Clicked()` of the Exit button.

Mocks for; more complicated languages (e.g. C++) are much trickier: Any code involving; classes tends to have a lot of non-trivial surface area (e.g. vtables) that; would require great care to mock. Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself. The ``-oop-executor`` and ``-oop-executor-connect`` options are helpful for testing; handling of cross-process and cross-architecture use cases. Roadmap; =======. JITLink is under active development.

Users take these classes to build a computational graph that represents the; PDF (also called ""model"") that they want to use for fitting the data.; The user then passes his final PDF and a RooAbsData object to the; RooAbsPdf::fitTo() method, which implicitly creates a negative-log likelihood; (NLL) that RooFit minimizes for parameter estimation.; The NLL object, internally created by RooAbsPdf::createNLL(), is a RooAbsArg; itself.; In technical terms, it's another larger computation graph that encompasses the; computation graph representing the PDF.

'``fence``' instructions take an :ref:`ordering <ordering>` argument which; defines what *synchronizes-with* edges they add. They can only be given; ``acquire``, ``release``, ``acq_rel``, and ``seq_cst`` orderings. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". A fence A which has (at least) ``release`` ordering semantics; *synchronizes with* a fence B with (at least) ``acquire`` ordering; semantics if and only if there exist atomic operations X and Y, both; operating on some atomic object M, such that A is sequenced before X, X; modifies M (either directly or through some side effect of a sequence; headed by X), Y is sequenced before B, and Y observes M. This provides a; *happens-before* dependency between A and B. Rather than an explicit; ``fence``, one (but not both) of the atomic operations X or Y might; provide a ``release`` or ``acquire`` (resp.) ordering constraint and; still *synchronize-with* the explicit ``fence`` and establish the; *happens-before* edge. A ``fence`` which has ``seq_cst`` ordering, in addition to having both; ``acquire`` and ``release`` semantics specified above, participates in; the global program order of other ``seq_cst`` operations and/or; fences. Furthermore, the global ordering created by a ``seq_cst``; fence must be compatible with the individual total orders of; ``monotonic`` (or stronger) memory accesses occurring before and after; such a fence. The exact semantics of this interaction are somewhat; complicated, see the C++ standard's `[atomics.order]; <https://wg21.link/atomics.order>`_ section for more details. A ``fence`` instruction can also take an optional; "":ref:`syncscope <syncscope>`"" argument.

The class loader utilizes so-called rootmap files, which by convention should; live alongside the dictionary shared library (and C++ module file).; These are simple text files, which map C++ entities (such as classes) to the; dictionaries and other libraries that need to be loaded for their use. With ``genreflex``, the mapping file can be automatically created with; ``--rootmap-lib=MyClassDict``, where ""MyClassDict"" is the name of the shared; library (without the extension) build from the dictionary file.; With ``rootcling``, create the same mapping file with; ``-rmf MyClassDict.rootmap -rml MyClassDict``.; It is necessary to provide the final library name explicitly, since it is; only in the separate linking step where these names are fixed and those names; may not match the default choice.

Integrability,"oads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information. While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges. A natural way to scale up the existing hand-coded mitigations is simply to; inject an `lfence` instruction into both the target and fallthrough; destinations of every conditional branch. This ensures that no predicate or; bounds check can be bypassed speculatively. However, the performance overhead; of this approach is, simply put, catastrophic. Yet it remains the only truly; ""secure by default"" approach known prior to this effort and serves as the; baseline for performance. One attempt to address the performance overhead of this and make it more; realistic to deploy is [MSVC's /Qspectre; switch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/).; Their technique is to use static analysis within the compiler to only insert; `lfence` instructions into conditional edges at risk of attack. However,; [initial](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/microsofts-compiler-level-spectre-fix-shows-how-hard-this-problem-will-be-to-solve/); [analysis](https://www.paulkocher.com/doc/MicrosoftCompilerSpectreMitigation.html); has shown that this approach is in",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:45181,inject,inject,45181,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['inject'],['inject']

If execution reaches the end of ``LoopPrinter::run()``, we know that the; loop shell looks like. .. code-block:: c++. for (int i= 0; i < expr(); ++i) { ... }. For now, we will just print a message explaining that we found a loop.; The next section will deal with recursively traversing the AST to; discover all changes needed. As a side note, it's not as trivial to test if two expressions are the same,; though Clang has already done the hard work for us by providing a way to; canonicalize expressions:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool areSameExpr(ASTContext *Context, const Expr *First,; const Expr *Second) {; if (!First || !Second); return false;; llvm::FoldingSetNodeID FirstID, SecondID;; First->Profile(FirstID, *Context, true);; Second->Profile(SecondID, *Context, true);; return FirstID == SecondID;; }. This code relies on the comparison between two; ``llvm::FoldingSetNodeIDs``. As the documentation for; ``Stmt::Profile()`` indicates, the ``Profile()`` member function builds; a description of a node in the AST, based on its properties, along with; those of its children. ``FoldingSetNodeID`` then serves as a hash we can; use to compare expressions.

Integrability,"ods out of the family based on the exact relationship; between the return type and the declaring class would be much too subtle; and fragile. Therefore we identify a small number of legitimate-seeming; return types and call everything else an error. This serves the secondary; purpose of encouraging programmers not to accidentally give methods names; in the ``init`` family. Note that a method with an ``init``-family selector which returns a; non-Objective-C type (e.g. ``void``) is perfectly well-formed; it simply; isn't in the ``init`` family. A program is ill-formed if a method's declarations, implementations, and; overrides do not all have the same method family. .. _arc.family.attribute:. Explicit method family control; ------------------------------. A method may be annotated with the ``objc_method_family`` attribute to; precisely control which method family it belongs to. If a method in an; ``@implementation`` does not have this attribute, but there is a method; declared in the corresponding ``@interface`` that does, then the attribute is; copied to the declaration in the ``@implementation``. The attribute is; available outside of ARC, and may be tested for with the preprocessor query; ``__has_attribute(objc_method_family)``. The attribute is spelled; ``__attribute__((objc_method_family(`` *family* ``)))``. If *family* is; ``none``, the method has no family, even if it would otherwise be considered to; have one based on its selector and type. Otherwise, *family* must be one of; ``alloc``, ``copy``, ``init``, ``mutableCopy``, or ``new``, in which case the; method is considered to belong to the corresponding family regardless of its; selector. It is an error if a method that is explicitly added to a family in; this way does not meet the requirements of the family other than the selector; naming convention. .. admonition:: Rationale.

System ``#include``\s. and each category should be sorted lexicographically by the full path. The `Main Module Header`_ file applies to ``.cpp`` files which implement an; interface defined by a ``.h`` file. This ``#include`` should always be included; **first** regardless of where it lives on the file system. By including a; header file first in the ``.cpp`` files that implement the interfaces, we ensure; that the header does not have any hidden dependencies which are not explicitly; ``#include``\d in the header, but should be. It is also a form of documentation; in the ``.cpp`` file to indicate where the interfaces it implements are defined. LLVM project and subproject headers should be grouped from most specific to least; specific, for the same reasons described above. For example, LLDB depends on; both clang and LLVM, and clang depends on LLVM. So an LLDB source file should; include ``lldb`` headers first, followed by ``clang`` headers, followed by; ``llvm`` headers, to reduce the possibility (for example) of an LLDB header; accidentally picking up a missing include due to the previous inclusion of that; header in the main source file or some earlier header file. clang should; similarly include its own headers before including llvm headers. This rule; applies to all LLVM subprojects. .. _fit into 80 columns:. Source Code Width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Write your code to fit within 80 columns. There must be some limit to the width of the code in; order to allow developers to have multiple files side-by-side in; windows on a modest display.

Error and Warning Messages; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clear diagnostic messages are important to help users identify and fix issues in; their inputs. Use succinct but correct English prose that gives the user the; context needed to understand what went wrong. Also, to match error message; styles commonly produced by other tools, start the first sentence with a; lower-case letter, and finish the last sentence without a period, if it would; end in one otherwise. Sentences which end with different punctuation, such as; ""did you forget ';'?"", should still do so. For example this is a good error message:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: section header 3 is corrupt. Size is 10 when it should be 20. This is a bad message, since it does not provide useful information and uses the; wrong style:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: Corrupt section header. As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly. When using ``report_fatal_error``, follow the same standards for the message as; regular error messages. Assertion messages and ``llvm_unreachable`` calls do not; necessarily need to follow these same styles as they are automatically; formatted, and thus these guidelines may not be suitable. ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:14690,message,message,14690,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['message'],['message']

Enumerations with a fixed underlying type; -----------------------------------------. Clang provides support for C++11 enumerations with a fixed underlying type; within Objective-C. For example, one can write an enumeration type as:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef enum : unsigned char { Red, Green, Blue } Color;. This specifies that the underlying type, which is used to store the enumeration; value, is ``unsigned char``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc.

Class Reference; Pages like the one for TH2 are; class references. They document the use and functionality of a class.

The template string supports argument substitution of the operands using ""``$``""; followed by a number, to indicate substitution of the given register/memory; location, as specified by the constraint string. ""``${NUM:MODIFIER}``"" may also; be used, where ``MODIFIER`` is a target-specific annotation for how to print the; operand (See :ref:`inline-asm-modifiers`).

Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit.

An end-user can convert a **`TF1`** object in a `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, using the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrapperMultiTF1`:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""gaus"");; ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 fitFunction(f1, f1->GetNdim() );; ROOT::Fit::Fitter fitter;; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; ```. When creating the wrapper, the parameter values stored in **`TF1`** will be copied in the `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` object.; The function object representing the model function is given to the `ROOT::Fitter` class using the `Fitter::SetFunction` method. The user has also the possibility to provide a function object, which implements the derivatives of the function with respect; to the parameters.; This information might be useful for some types of fits. In this case he needs to provide the function object as a class deriving from the; `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim` interface.; Note that the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` implements also the gradient interface, using internally `TF1::GradientPar`,; which is based on numerical differentiation, apart for the case of linear functions (i.e. when `TF1::IsLinear()` is `true`).; The parameter derivatives of the model function can be useful to some minimization algorithms, such as Fumili.; However, in general is better to leave the minimization algorithm (e.g. Minuit) to compute the needed derivatives using its own customised; numerical differentiation algorithm.; In order to not provide to the fitter the parameter derivatives, we explicitly passed in `Fitter::SetFunction` a `false` value. ### Fit Configuration.

For example, given the; following classes:. .. code-block:: objc. @interface NSObject; + (id)alloc;; - (id)init;; @end. @interface NSArray : NSObject; @end. and this common initialization pattern. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] init];. the type of the expression ``[NSArray alloc]`` is ``NSArray*`` because; ``alloc`` implicitly has a related result type. Similarly, the type of the; expression ``[[NSArray alloc] init]`` is ``NSArray*``, since ``init`` has a; related result type and its receiver is known to have the type ``NSArray *``.; If neither ``alloc`` nor ``init`` had a related result type, the expressions; would have had type ``id``, as declared in the method signature. A method with a related result type can be declared by using the type; ``instancetype`` as its result type. ``instancetype`` is a contextual keyword; that is only permitted in the result type of an Objective-C method, e.g. .. code-block:: objc. @interface A; + (instancetype)constructAnA;; @end. The related result type can also be inferred for some methods. To determine; whether a method has an inferred related result type, the first word in the; camel-case selector (e.g., ""``init``"" in ""``initWithObjects``"") is considered,; and the method will have a related result type if its return type is compatible; with the type of its class and if:. * the first word is ""``alloc``"" or ""``new``"", and the method is a class method,; or. * the first word is ""``autorelease``"", ""``init``"", ""``retain``"", or ""``self``"",; and the method is an instance method.

Integrability,"of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------.

Occurrences of class `MyClass`; of `MyLib` will now be referenced as `../mylib/MyClass.html`. ### Search Engine. **`THtml`** can invoke external search engines. The ROOT reference guide; sets `Root.Html.Search` to <http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+site%3A%u>.; Calling **`THtml::SetSearchStemURL()`** will set the same.

It will; send the words entered in these search fields as %s in the URL; %u will; be replaced by the current document's path, allowing a site- and; directory-specific search. ### ViewCVS. Most code is managed in a version control system like CVS. ViewCVS is a; WWW reader interface to the versioning control system that allows e.g.; tracking a file's changes. **`THtml`** will reference these pages; automatically if the `.rootrc` variable `Root.Html.ViewCVS` is set to; the URL stem of the ViewCVS. installation. Alternatively, one can call; THtml::SetViewCVS(). ### Wiki Pages.

A successful example of this; is the PHP.net documentation with its user annotations. **`THtml`** can; include a link to a class's Wiki page by setting the Wiki base URL via; `Root.Html.WikiURL` or **`THtml`**`::SetWikiURL()`. ## Tutorial.

Integrability,"oftware engineering practice dictates that mutexes should be private; members, because the locking mechanism used by a thread-safe class is part of; its internal implementation. However, private mutexes can sometimes leak into; the public interface of a class.; Thread safety attributes follow normal C++ access restrictions, so if ``mu``; is a private member of ``c``, then it is an error to write ``c.mu`` in an; attribute. One workaround is to (ab)use the ``RETURN_CAPABILITY`` attribute to provide a; public *name* for a private mutex, without actually exposing the underlying; mutex. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class MyClass {; private:; Mutex mu;. public:; // For thread safety analysis only. Does not need to be defined.; Mutex* getMu() RETURN_CAPABILITY(mu);. void doSomething() REQUIRES(mu);; };. void doSomethingTwice(MyClass& c) REQUIRES(c.getMu()) {; // The analysis thinks that c.getMu() == c.mu; c.doSomething();; c.doSomething();; }. In the above example, ``doSomethingTwice()`` is an external routine that; requires ``c.mu`` to be locked, which cannot be declared directly because ``mu``; is private. This pattern is discouraged because it; violates encapsulation, but it is sometimes necessary, especially when adding; annotations to an existing code base. The workaround is to define ``getMu()``; as a fake getter method, which is provided only for the benefit of thread; safety analysis. .. _conditional_locks:.

Because the resume and destroy functions are shared across all suspend; points, suspend points must store the index of the active suspend in; the coroutine object, and the resume/destroy functions must switch over; that index to get back to the correct point. Hence the name of this; lowering. Pointers to the resume and destroy functions are stored in the coroutine; object at known offsets which are fixed for all coroutines. A completed; coroutine is represented with a null resume function. There is a somewhat complex protocol of intrinsics for allocating and; deallocating the coroutine object. It is complex in order to allow the; allocation to be elided due to inlining. This protocol is discussed; in further detail below. The frontend may generate code to call the coroutine function directly;; this will become a call to the ramp function and will return a pointer; to the coroutine object. The frontend should always resume or destroy; the coroutine using the corresponding intrinsics. Returned-Continuation Lowering; ------------------------------. In returned-continuation lowering, signaled by the use of; `llvm.coro.id.retcon` or `llvm.coro.id.retcon.once`, some aspects of; the ABI must be handled more explicitly by the frontend. In this lowering, every suspend point takes a list of ""yielded values""; which are returned back to the caller along with a function pointer,; called the continuation function. The coroutine is resumed by simply; calling this continuation function pointer.

The example; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C` calls a script to build the root; file if it does not exist:. ``` {.cpp}; void cernstaff() {; if (gSystem->AccessPathName(""cernstaff.root"")) {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".x cernbuild.C"");; }; ```. `ProcessLine` takes a parameter, which is a pointer to an `int` or to; a `TInterpreter::EErrorCode` to let you access the interpreter error; code after an attempt to interpret. This will contain the error; as defined in `enum TInterpreter::EErrorCode` with `TInterpreter::kSuccess` being; the value for a successful execution. ### Executing a Script From the Invocation. Instead if starting ROOT and running a script on the prompt you can also pass; it to ROOT in its invocation:. ```; $ root -l -b 'myCode.C(""some String"", 12)'; ```. The exact kind of quoting depends on your shell; the one shown here works for; bash-like shells. ROOT can evaluate any expression as part of the invocation; another version of; the previous example can be spelled like this:. ```; $ root -l -b -e 'gROOT->ProcessLine("".x myCode.C(\""some String\"", 12)"");'; ```. ## C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting.

Integrability,"om iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions.

The argument should; *never* be a derived class or the class itself: the template machinery; for ``isa<>`` already handles this case and optimizes it.; #. For each class in the hierarchy that has no children, implement a; ``classof`` that checks only against its ``Kind``.; #. For each class in the hierarchy that has children, implement a; ``classof`` that checks a range of the first child's ``Kind`` and the; last child's ``Kind``. RTTI for Open Class Hierarchies; ===============================. Sometimes it is not possible to know all types in a hierarchy ahead of time.; For example, in the shapes hierarchy described above the authors may have; wanted their code to work for user defined shapes too. To support use cases; that require open hierarchies LLVM provides the ``RTTIRoot`` and; ``RTTIExtends`` utilities. The ``RTTIRoot`` class describes an interface for performing RTTI checks. The; ``RTTIExtends`` class template provides an implementation of this interface; for classes derived from ``RTTIRoot``. ``RTTIExtends`` uses the ""`Curiously; Recurring Template Idiom`_"", taking the class being defined as its first; template argument and the parent class as the second argument. Any class that; uses ``RTTIExtends`` must define a ``static char ID`` member, the address of; which will be used to identify the type. This open-hierarchy RTTI support should only be used if your use case requires; it. Otherwise the standard LLVM RTTI system should be preferred. .. _`Curiously Recurring Template Idiom`:; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern.

If you have commit access, there are multiple workflows to commit the; change. Whichever method you follow it is recommended that your commit message; ends with the line:. ::. Differential Revision: <URL>. where ``<URL>`` is the URL for the code review, starting with; ``https://reviews.llvm.org/``. This allows people reading the version history to see the review for; context. This also allows Phabricator to detect the commit, close the; review, and add a link from the review to the commit. Note that if you use the Arcanist tool the ``Differential Revision`` line will; be added automatically. If you don't want to use Arcanist, you can add the; ``Differential Revision`` line (as the last line) to the commit message; yourself. Using the Arcanist tool can simplify the process of committing reviewed code as; it will retrieve reviewers, the ``Differential Revision``, etc from the review; and place it in the commit message.

This implies that it's possible to introduce spurious stores on entry to; the function without introducing traps or data races. This does not; necessarily hold throughout the whole function, as the pointer may escape; to a different thread during the execution of the function. See also the; :ref:`atomic optimization guide <Optimization outside atomic>`. The ""other attributes"" that imply dereferenceability are; ``dereferenceable_or_null`` (if the pointer is non-null) and the; ``sret``, ``byval``, ``byref``, ``inalloca``, ``preallocated`` family of; attributes. Note that not all of these combinations are useful, e.g.; ``byval`` arguments are known to be writable even without this attribute. The ``writable`` attribute cannot be combined with ``readnone``,; ``readonly`` or a ``memory`` attribute that does not contain; ``argmem: write``. ``dead_on_unwind``; At a high level, this attribute indicates that the pointer argument is dead; if the call unwinds, in the sense that the caller will not depend on the; contents of the memory. Stores that would only be visible on the unwind; path can be elided. More precisely, the behavior is as-if any memory written through the; pointer during the execution of the function is overwritten with a poison; value on unwind. This includes memory written by the implicit write implied; by the ``writable`` attribute. The caller is allowed to access the affected; memory, but all loads that are not preceded by a store will return poison. This attribute cannot be applied to return values. .. _gc:.

These guidelines are very similar to rules used by other open source; projects.

It; also should avoid being vague or overly specific. For example, ""bits were not; set right"" will leave the reviewer wondering about which bits, and why they; weren't right, while ""Correctly set overflow bits in TargetInfo"" conveys almost; all there is to the change. Below are some guidelines about the format of the message itself:. * Separate the commit message into title and body separated by a blank line. * If you're not the original author, ensure the 'Author' property of the commit is; set to the original author and the 'Committer' property is set to yourself.; You can use a command similar to; ``git commit --amend --author=""John Doe <jdoe@llvm.org>""`` to correct the; author property if it is incorrect. See `Attribution of Changes`_ for more; information including the method we used for attribution before the project; migrated to git. In the rare situation where there are multiple authors, please use the `git; tag 'Co-authored-by:' to list the additional authors; <https://github.blog/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/>`_. * The title should be concise.

On the other hand, any volume is a small world by itself - what we need; to do is to take it out and to ignore all the rest since it is a; self-contained object. In fact, the modeller can act like this,; considering a given volume as temporary MARS, but we will describe this; feature later on. Let us focus on the biggest pack - it is mandatory to; define one. Consider the simplest geometry that is made of a single box.; Here is an example on how to build it:. \anchor GP00a; ### Example 1: Creating the World. We first need to load the geometry library. This is not needed if one; does ""make map"" in root folder. ~~~{.cpp}; root[] gSystem->Load(""libGeom"");; ~~~. Second, we have to create an instance of the geometry manager class.; This takes care of all the modeller components, performing several tasks; to insure geometry validity and containing the user interface for; building and interacting with the geometry. After its creation, the; geometry manager class can be accessed with the global; `gGeoManager`:. ~~~{.cpp}; root[] new TGeoManager(""world"", ""the simplest geometry"");; ~~~. We want to create a single volume in our geometry, but since any volume; needs to have an associated medium, we will create a dummy one.

We can finally make our volume having a box shape. Note that the world; volume does not need to be a box - it can be any other shape.

Integrability,"on case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` iteration for both PyPy and; CPython, easily outperforming looping over an equivalent numpy array. In CPython, the performance of `non-overloaded` function calls depends; greatly on the Python interpreter's internal specializations; and Python3; has many specializations specific to basic extension modules (C function; pointer calls), gaining a performance boost of more than 30% over Python2.; Only since Python3.8 is there also better support for closure objects (vector; calls) as cppyy uses, to short-cut through the interpreter's own overhead. As a practical consideration, whether a binder performs well on code that you; care about, depends `entirely` on whether it has the relevant specializations; for your most performance-sensitive use cases.; The only way to know for sure is to write a test application and measure, but; a binder that provides more specializations, or makes it easy to add your; own, is more likely to deliver. `Manual v.s. automatic`; -----------------------. Python is, today, one of the most popular programming languages and has a; rich and mature eco-system around it.; But when the project that became cppyy started in the field of High Energy; Physics (HEP), Python usage was non-existent there.; As a Python user to work in this predominantly C++ environment, you had to; bring your own bindings, thus automatic was the only way to go.; Binders such as SWIG, SIP (or even boost.python with Pyste) all had the fatal; assumption that you were providing Python bindings to your `own` C++ code,; and that you were thus able to modify those (many) areas of the C++ codes; that their parsers could not handle.; The `CIN",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:4216,depend,depends,4216,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"on is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors.

As explained before various minimization packages can be used when fitting in ROOT.; We have seen before how to configure the `Fitter` class to use different minimization packages; and different minimization options.; When using the `Fit` method the minimization package (and its options) can be selected using the; static methods of the `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions` class.; For example to select `Minuit2` instead of `Minuit` for fitting an histogram do:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit2"");; // fit the histogram histo with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; ```. In the following we will give some brief description of the minimization packages.; The packages all implement the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface which can be use for; finding the minimum of a multi-dimensional function.; The interface is documented in the Mathematical Library Chapter. In addition packages like Minuit or Minuit2 provide their own interfaces. ## MINUIT (Old TMInuit Version). This package was originally written in FORTRAN by Fred James and part; of `PACKLIB` (patch D506). It has been converted to a C++ class by; René Brun. The current implementation in C++ is a straightforward; conversion of the original FORTRAN version. The main changes are:. - The variables in the various `Minuit` labeled common blocks have; been changed to the **`TMinuit`** class data members. - The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the; maximum number of parameters are now data members' arrays with a; dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems by; simply initializing the **`TMinuit`** constructor with the maximum; number of parameters. - The include file `Minuit.h` has been commented as much as possible; using existing comments in the code or the printed documentation. - The original `Minuit` subroutines are now",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:52821,interface,interface,52821,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"on provides basically; all the functionality present in the old Fortran version, with almost equivalent; numerical accuracy and computational performances. Furthermore, it contains new; functionality, like the possibility to set single side parameter limits or the; FUMILI algorithm, which is an optimized method for least square and log likelihood; minimizations. The package has been originally developed by M. Winkler and F. James.; More information on the new C++ version can be found on the; [MINUIT Web Site](http://www.cern.ch/minuit). Minuit2, originally developed in the SEAL project, is now distributed within %ROOT.; The API has been then changed in this new version to follow the %ROOT coding convention; (function names starting with capital letters) and the classes have been moved inside; the namespace _ROOT::Minuit2_. In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes; needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements; the interface ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using; the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2\.; An example of using this interface is the %ROOT tutorial _tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C_; or the Minuit2 test program; [<tt>testMinimize.cxx</tt>](https://github.com/cxx-hep/root-cern/blob/master/math/minuit2/test/testMinimize.cxx). A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be easily built and installed using `CMake`. See this [`README`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/minuit2/README.md) for the instructions on how to get the sources, building and installing a stand-alone Minuit2. The [Minuit2 User Guide](https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/minuit2/Minuit2.html); provides all the information needed for using directly (without add-on packages like %ROOT) Minuit2. ## References. 1.

If necessary, one can add custom path as well, using [THttpServer::AddLocation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a5322c3bbfddb8eb6849297d83ccaf87f) method:. ```cpp; serv->AddLocation(""mydir/"", ""/home/user/specials"");; ```. Then files from that directory could be addressed via URL like ""http://localhost:8080/mydir/myfile.root"". ## Command interface. THttpServer class provide simple interface to invoke command from web browser.; One just register command like:. ```cpp; serv->RegisterCommand(""/DoSomething"", ""SomeFunction()"");; ```.

Added correct treatment of extended term in asymptotically correct method for uncertainty determination in the presence of weights.; This improvement will allow for extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits to use the asymptotically correct method when using the `RooFit::AsymptoticError()` command argument in [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#ab0721374836c343a710f5ff92a326ff5).; See also this [writeup on extended weighted fits](https://root.cern/files/extended_weighted_fits.pdf) that is also linked from the reference guide.; The [pull request](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14751) that introduced this feature might also be a good reference. ### Compile your code with memory safe interfaces. If you define the `ROOFIT_MEMORY_SAFE_INTERFACES` preprocessor macro, the; RooFit interface changes in a way such that memory leaks are avoided. The most prominent effect of this change is that many functions that used to; return an owning pointer (e.g., a pointer to an object that you need to; manually `delete`) are then returning a `std::unique_pt` for automatic memory; management. For example this code would not compile anymore, because there is the risk that; the caller forgets to `delete params`:; ```c++; RooArgSet * params = pdf.getParameters(nullptr);; ```; If you wrap such return values in a `std::unique_ptr`, then your code will; compile both with and without memory safe interfaces:; ```c++; std::unique_ptr<RooArgSet> params{pdf.getParameters(nullptr)};; ```. Also some `virtual` RooFit functions like [RooAbsReal::createIntegral()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsReal.html#aff4be07dd6a131721daeeccf6359aea9); are returning a different type conditional on `ROOFIT_MEMORY_SAFE_INTERFACES`.; If you are overriding such a function, you need to ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:8510,interface,interface,8510,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Orthogonal transforms can be successfully used for the; processing of nuclear spectra. They can be used to remove high; frequency noise, to increase signal-to-background ratio as well as to; enhance low intensity components [14]. We have implemented also the; function for the calculation of the commonly used orthogonal transforms:. - Haar; - Walsh; - Cos; - Sin; - Fourier; - Hartley. Between these transform one can define so called generalized mixed; transforms that are also implemented in the transform function:. - Fourier-Haar; - Fourier-Walsh; - Walsh-Haar; - Cos-Walsh; - Cos-Haar; - Sin-Walsh; - Sin-Haar. The suitability of the application of appropriate transform depends on; the character of the data, i.e., on the shape of dominant components; contained in the data. The form of the transform function is as follows:. ```{.cpp}; char *Transform1(const float *source,; float *dest,; int size,; int type,; int direction,; int degree);; ```. This function transforms the source spectrum. The calling program; should fill in the input parameters. Transformed data are written into the dest spectrum. Function parameters:. - **`source`**: pointer to the vector of the source spectrum, its length should be equal to the `size` parameter except for inverse FOURIER, FOUR-WALSH, FOUR-HAAR transform. These need 2*`size` length to supply real and imaginary coefficients; - **`dest`**: pointer to the vector of the dest data, its length should be equal to the size parameter except for direct FOURIER, FOUR-WALSh, FOUR-HAAR.

Whichever method you follow it is recommended that your commit message; ends with the line:. ::. Differential Revision: <URL>. where ``<URL>`` is the URL for the code review, starting with; ``https://reviews.llvm.org/``.

If; a new node with the same state and program point as an existing node; would get generated, the path ""caches out"" and we simply reuse the; existing node. Thus the ExplodedGraph is not a DAG; it can contain; cycles as paths loop back onto each other and cache out. ProgramState and ExplodedNodes are basically immutable once created. Once; one creates a ProgramState, you need to create a new one to get a new; ProgramState. This immutability is key since the ExplodedGraph represents; the behavior of the analyzed program from the entry point. To; represent these efficiently, we use functional data structures (e.g.,; ImmutableMaps) which share data between instances. Finally, individual Checkers work by also manipulating the analysis; state. The analyzer engine talks to them via a visitor interface.; For example, the PreVisitCallExpr() method is called by ExprEngine; to tell the Checker that we are about to analyze a CallExpr, and the; checker is asked to check for any preconditions that might not be; satisfied.

For variant #1.2, the attacker speculatively stores into the vtable or jump; table used to implement an indirect call or indirect jump. Because this is; speculative, this will often be possible even when these are stored in; read-only pages. For example:; ```; class FancyObject : public BaseObject {; public:; void DoSomething() override;; };; void f(unsigned long attacker_offset, unsigned long attacker_data) {; FancyObject object = getMyObject();; unsigned long *arr[4] = getFourDataPointers();; if (attacker_offset < 4) {; // We have bypassed the bounds check speculatively.; unsigned long *data = arr[attacker_offset];; // Now we have computed a pointer inside of `object`, the vptr.; *data = attacker_data;; // The vptr points to the virtual table and we speculatively clobber that.; g(object); // Hand the object to some other routine.; }; }; // In another file, we call a method on the object.; void g(BaseObject &object) {; object.DoSomething();; // This speculatively calls the address stored over the vtable.; }; ```. Mitigating this requires hardening loads from these locations, or mitigating; the indirect call or indirect jump. Any of these are sufficient to block the; call or jump from using a speculatively stored value that has been read back. For both of these, using retpolines would be equally sufficient. One possible; hybrid approach is to use retpolines for indirect call and jump, while relying; on SLH to mitigate returns. Another approach that is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores.

The implementation of these ideas in LLVM may be slightly different than; what is mentioned in the papers. These differences are documented in; the `implementation details <implementation-details_>`_. .. _DataDependenceGraph:. Data Dependence Graph; =====================; In its simplest form the Data Dependence Graph (or DDG) represents data; dependencies between individual instructions. Each node in such a graph; represents a single instruction and is referred to as an ""atomic"" node.; It is also possible to combine some atomic nodes that have a simple; def-use dependency between them into larger nodes that contain multiple-; instructions. As described in [1]_ the DDG uses graph abstraction to group nodes; that are part of a strongly connected component of the graph; into special nodes called pi-blocks. pi-blocks represent cycles of data; dependency that prevent reordering transformations. Since any strongly; connected component of the graph is a maximal subgraph of all the nodes; that form a cycle, pi-blocks are at most one level deep. In other words,; no pi-blocks are nested inside another pi-block, resulting in a; hierarchical representation that is at most one level deep. For example, consider the following:. .. code-block:: c++. for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {; b[i] = c[i] + b[i-1];; }. This code contains a statement that has a loop carried dependence on; itself creating a cycle in the DDG. The figure below illustrates; how the cycle of dependency is carried through multiple def-use relations; and a memory access dependency. .. image:: cycle.png. The DDG corresponding to this example would have a pi-block that contains; all the nodes participating in the cycle, as shown below:. .. image:: cycle_pi.png.

In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types; replacing the normal ones, e.g. `Double_t`, `Float_t` or `Int_t`; replacing the standard `double`, `float` or `int` types.

Communication between Compiled Code and Interpreted Code; --------------------------------------------------------. In Clang-Repl there is **interpreted code**, and this feature adds a 'value'; runtime that can talk to the **compiled code**. Following is an example where the compiled code interacts with the interpreter; code. The execution results of an expression are stored in the object 'V' of; type Value. This value is then printed, effectively helping the interpreter; use a value from the compiled code. .. code-block:: console. int Global = 42;; void setGlobal(int val) { Global = val; }; int getGlobal() { return Global; }; Interp.ParseAndExecute(“void setGlobal(int val);”);; Interp.ParseAndExecute(“int getGlobal();”);; Value V;; Interp.ParseAndExecute(“getGlobal()”, &V);; std::cout << V.getAs<int>() << “\n”; // Prints 42. **Note:** Above is an example of interoperability between the compiled code and; the interpreted code. Interoperability between languages (e.g., C++ and Python); works similarly. 2. Dump Captured Execution Results; ==================================. This feature helps create a temporary dump to display the value and type; (pretty print) of the desired data. This is a good way to interact with the; interpreter during interactive programming. How value printing is simplified (Automatic Printf); ---------------------------------------------------. The ``Automatic Printf`` feature makes it easy to display variable values during; program execution. Using the ``printf`` function repeatedly is not required.; This is achieved using an extension in the ``libclangInterpreter`` library.

Object Loading; ==============. Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or; having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld to; be loaded. The RuntimeDyld wrapper class examines the object to determine; its file format and creates an instance of either RuntimeDyldELF or; RuntimeDyldMachO (both of which derive from the RuntimeDyldImpl base; class) and calls the RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject method to perform that; actual loading. .. image:: MCJIT-dyld-load.png.

RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and; an external symbol relocation map. .. image:: MCJIT-load-object.png.

Integrability,"opt - LLVM optimizer; ====================. .. program:: opt. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`opt` [*options*] [*filename*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer. It takes; LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or analyses on it,; and then outputs the optimized file. The optimizations available via; :program:`opt` depend upon what libraries were linked into it as well as any; additional libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-load` option. Use; the :option:`-help` option to determine what optimizations you can use. If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is ""``-``"", :program:`opt`; reads its input from standard input. Inputs can be in either the LLVM assembly; language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``). If an output filename is not specified with the :option:`-o` option,; :program:`opt` writes its output to the standard output. OPTIONS; -------. .. option:: -f. Enable binary output on terminals. Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse to; write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal. With this option,; :program:`opt` will write raw bitcode regardless of the output device. .. option:: -help. Print a summary of command line options. .. option:: -o <filename>. Specify the output filename. .. option:: -S. Write output in LLVM intermediate language (instead of bitcode). .. option:: -{passname}. :program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or; analysis passes in any order. The :option:`-help` option lists all the passes; available. The order in which the options occur on the command line are the; order in which they are executed (within pass constraints). .. option:: -strip-debug. This option causes opt to strip debug information from the module before; applying other optimizations. It is essentially the same as `-strip`; but it ensures that stripping of debug information is done first. .. option:: -verify-each.

The '``llvm.vp.inttoptr``' intrinsic takes a value to cast as its first operand; , which must be a vector of :ref:`integer <t_integer>` type, and a type to cast; it to return type, which must be a vector of pointers type.; The second operand is the vector mask. The return type, the value to cast, and; the vector mask have the same number of elements.; The third operand is the explicit vector length of the operation. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.vp.inttoptr``' intrinsic converts ``value`` to return type by; applying either a zero extension or a truncation depending on the size of the; integer ``value``. If ``value`` is larger than the size of a pointer, then a; truncation is done. If ``value`` is smaller than the size of a pointer, then a; zero extension is done. If they are the same size, nothing is done (*no-op cast*).; The conversion is performed on lane positions below the explicit vector length; and where the vector mask is true. Masked-off lanes are ``poison``. Examples:; """""""""""""""""". .. code-block:: llvm. %r = call <4 x ptr> @llvm.vp.inttoptr.v4p0i32.v4i32(<4 x i32> %a, <4 x i1> %mask, i32 %evl); ;; For all lanes below %evl, %r is lane-wise equivalent to %also.r. %t = inttoptr <4 x i32> %a to <4 x ptr>; %also.r = select <4 x i1> %mask, <4 x ptr> %t, <4 x ptr> poison. .. _int_vp_fcmp:.

In addition we use now the ROOT convention for all enumeration names defining the type of numerical algorithms. The names start with k, like kADAPTIVE for the integration type. This change affects both MathCore and MathMore and it breaks backward compatibility. MathCore Function interfaces; Mathcore provides as well interfaces for the evaluation of mathematical and parametric functions to be used in the numerical methods. This release contains the following changes:. The ROOT::Math::IParamFunction, ROOT::Math::IParamMultiFunction interfaces (used mainly for fitting) require now a pointer to the parameters (type const double *), when evaluating the function. The derived classes must implement now the const; method DoEvalPar (and not DoEval as before). In addition the method; operator()(const double * x, const double * p) is now const. This change makes the caching of parameter not hidden and the interface is now; thread-safe. ; A similar change in the ROOT::Math::IParamGradFunction, ROOT::Math::IParamMultiGradFunction interfaces, where the parameter values are now required for calculating the partial derivatives with respect to the parameters.; This changes the signature of the pure abstract method, DoParameterDerivative(const double *x, const double * p, , which takes also a pointer (type const double *) to the parameters.; In addition, these classes do not inherit anymore from the function gradient interface (ROOT::Math::IGradFunction and ROOT::Math::IMultiGradFunction). They define only the parameter gradient which is needed for fitting and not the coordinate gradient. A derived class, like ROOT::Math::Polynomial, implementing both functionality (coordinate and parameter gradient) inherits then from both interfaces.; .

Integrability,"ort; =============. .. caution::. This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.4.0.; It is still incomplete (see listing below) and has only been tested on; Linux on x86_64. Numba `is a JIT compiler`_ for Python functions that can be statically typed; based on their input arguments.; Since C++ objects are always statically typed and already implemented at the; machine level, they can be dynamically integrated into the Numba type tracing; and lowering by exposing type details through C++ reflection at runtime. JIT-compiling traces of mixed Python/bound C++ code reduces, and in some; cases removes, the overhead of boxing/unboxing native data into their Python; proxies and vice versa.; It can also reduce or remove temporaries, especially for template; expressions.; Thus, there can be significant speedups for mixed code, beyond the Numba; compilation of Python code itself.; The current implementation integrates compiled C++ through function pointers,; object pointers, and pointer offsets, into the intermediate representation; (IR) as generated by Numba.; A future version may integrate Cling-generated IR directly into Numba IR (or; vice versa), e.g. if the C++ code is exposed from (precompiled) headers.; This would allow inlining of C++ code into Numba traces, for further; expected speedups. Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:959,integrat,integrates,959,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrates']

There are two kinds of expressions:. * :ref:`Absolute<amdgpu_synid_absolute_expression>`.; * :ref:`Relocatable<amdgpu_synid_relocatable_expression>`. .. _amdgpu_synid_absolute_expression:. Absolute Expressions; --------------------. The value of an absolute expression does not change after program relocation.; Absolute expressions must not include unassigned and relocatable values; such as labels. Absolute expressions are evaluated to 64-bit integer values and converted to; :ref:`expected operand type<amdgpu_syn_instruction_type>`; as described :ref:`here<amdgpu_synid_int_conv>`. Examples:. .. parsed-literal::. x = -1; y = x + 10. .. _amdgpu_synid_relocatable_expression:. Relocatable Expressions; -----------------------. The value of a relocatable expression depends on program relocation. Note that use of relocatable expressions is limited to branch targets; and 32-bit integer operands. A relocatable expression is evaluated to a 64-bit integer value,; which depends on operand kind and; :ref:`relocation type<amdgpu-relocation-records>` of symbol(s); used in the expression. For example, if an instruction refers to a label,; this reference is evaluated to an offset from the address after; the instruction to the label address:. .. parsed-literal::. label:; v_add_co_u32_e32 v0, vcc, label, v1 // 'label' operand is evaluated to -4. Note that values of relocatable expressions are usually unknown; at assembly time; they are resolved later by a linker and converted to; :ref:`expected operand type<amdgpu_syn_instruction_type>`; as described :ref:`here<amdgpu_synid_rl_conv>`. Operands and Operations; -----------------------. Expressions are composed of 64-bit integer operands and operations.; Operands include :ref:`integer numbers<amdgpu_synid_integer_number>`; and :ref:`symbols<amdgpu_synid_symbol>`.

They are; usually generated externally, which poses problems with where to keep; the images, and how to keep them up to date. **`THtml`** solves this by; offering a few special documentation elements: macro and latex; directives. ### Latex Directive. Documentation surrounded by the keywords `BEGIN_LATEX / END_LATEX` will; be passed to ROOT Latex engine **`TLatex`**. The keywords can be written; with small or capital letters (case insensitive). The output will be; stored to an image file, which gets automatically included in the; documentation. ``` {.cpp}; // This function calculates BEGIN_LATEX; // F(x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #prod(x < x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #frac{1}{2}; // END_LATEX; ```. THtml will inject the following picture:. ![](pictures/0300022D.png). The image file name is generated from the formula and will be unique for; all the documentation. It is stored along-side the documentation, and it; will be automatically regenerated when the documentation is updated. The; handling of the Latex directive is done by the class; **`TDocLatexDirective`**. The `BEGIN_LATEX` keyword can take the following parameters:. - `fontsize`: sets the **`TLatex`** font size. The default value is 16. - `separator`: sets a list of characters for which a new column will; be started. This allows aligned, multi-line, multi-column layout,; which can be useful for e.g. mathematical derivations. It is unset; by default, meaning the Latex directive will only generate one; column. - `rseparator`: like separator, but a regular expression. Columns; start with a match of this regular expression. Only one of separator; or rseparator can be given. - `align`: defines the alignment of the columns.

To do this, implement JIT code; generation by performing the following steps:. * Write an ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` file that contains a machine function pass; that transforms target-machine instructions into relocatable machine; code. * Write an ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` file that implements the JIT interfaces for; target-specific code-generation activities, such as emitting machine code and; stubs. * Modify ``XXXTargetMachine`` so that it provides a ``TargetJITInfo`` object; through its ``getJITInfo`` method. There are several different approaches to writing the JIT support code. For; instance, TableGen and target descriptor files may be used for creating a JIT; code generator, but are not mandatory. For the Alpha and PowerPC target; machines, TableGen is used to generate ``XXXGenCodeEmitter.inc``, which; contains the binary coding of machine instructions and the; ``getBinaryCodeForInstr`` method to access those codes. Other JIT; implementations do not. Both ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` and ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` must include the; ``llvm/CodeGen/MachineCodeEmitter.h`` header file that defines the; ``MachineCodeEmitter`` class containing code for several callback functions; that write data (in bytes, words, strings, etc.) to the output stream.

To facilitate the user to insert their own type of function in the needed function interface, helper classes, wrapping the user interface in the; `ROOT::Math` function interfaces are provided.; this will avoid the user to re-implement dedicated function classes, following the code example shown in the previous paragraphs.

RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; RooRealVar y(""y"",""y"",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; ; RooFormulaVar x_lo(""x_lo"",""y-20"",y) ; ; RooFormulaVar x_hi(""x_hi"",""sin(y)*5"",y) ; ; x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ; // Change x to have variable range depending on y; ; It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way. x.setRange(""signalRegion"",x_lo,x_hi) ;. There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges; that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables ; x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z; and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z); over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into; account. A definition of a range 'R' on the other hand where the bounds of x depend on y and; the bounds of y depend on x is not allowed, and an error message will be printed to complain about; the ambiguity of the problem definition. Integrals over non-rectangular regions are created the; same way as integrals over rectangular regions using the RooAbsReal::createIntegral() function, the; chosen mode of operation depends on the shape of the requestion integration range. Note that in general integration over non (hyper)rectangular regions will be more computationally; intensive as only a subset of the observables can be integrated analytically (all of those that do not; have parameterized ranges plus those that have parameterized ranges but are not involved in the; parameterization of others (e.g. x and y in the example above).

At this point, we know that the binary operator to the RHS of our; primary has higher precedence than the binop we are currently parsing.; As such, we know that any sequence of pairs whose operators are all; higher precedence than ""+"" should be parsed together and returned as; ""RHS"". To do this, we recursively invoke the ``ParseBinOpRHS`` function; specifying ""TokPrec+1"" as the minimum precedence required for it to; continue. In our example above, this will cause it to return the AST; node for ""(c+d)\*e\*f"" as RHS, which is then set as the RHS of the '+'; expression. Finally, on the next iteration of the while loop, the ""+g"" piece is; parsed and added to the AST. With this little bit of code (14; non-trivial lines), we correctly handle fully general binary expression; parsing in a very elegant way. This was a whirlwind tour of this code,; and it is somewhat subtle. I recommend running through it with a few; tough examples to see how it works. This wraps up handling of expressions.

Integrability,"path where the; conservative mode is used. Objective-C Message Heuristics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ExprEngine relies on a set of heuristics to partition the set of Objective-C; method calls into those that require bifurcation and those that do not. Below; are the cases when the DynamicTypeInfo of the object is considered precise; (cannot be a subclass):. - If the object was created with +alloc or +new and initialized with an -init; method. - If the calls are property accesses using dot syntax. This is based on the; assumption that children rarely override properties, or do so in an; essentially compatible way. - If the class interface is declared inside the main source file. In this case; it is unlikely that it will be subclassed. - If the method is not declared outside of main source file, either by the; receiver's class or by any superclasses. C++ Caveats; ^^^^^^^^^^^. C++11 [class.cdtor]p4 describes how the vtable of an object is modified as it is; being constructed or destructed; that is, the type of the object depends on; which base constructors have been completed. This is tracked using; DynamicTypeInfo in the DynamicTypePropagation checker. There are several limitations in the current implementation:. * Temporaries are poorly modeled right now because we're not confident in the; placement of their destructors in the CFG. We currently won't inline their; constructors unless the destructor is trivial, and don't process their; destructors at all, not even to invalidate the region. * 'new' is poorly modeled due to some nasty CFG/design issues. This is tracked; in PR12014. 'delete' is not modeled at all. * Arrays of objects are modeled very poorly right now. ExprEngine currently; only simulates the first constructor and first destructor.

For example,; the global variable ``g`` in the following code is implicitly ``__single`` so; ``typeof(g)`` gets ``char *__single``. The similar is true for the parameter; ``p``, so ``typeof(p)`` returns ``void *__single``. The local variable ``l`` is; implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``, so ``typeof(l)`` becomes; ``int *__bidi_indexable``. .. code-block:: C. char *g; // typeof(g) == char *__single. void foo(void *p) {; // typeof(p) == void *__single. int *l; // typeof(l) == int *__bidi_indexable; }. When the type of expression has an ""external"" bounds annotation, e.g.,; ``__sized_by``, ``__counted_by``, etc., the compiler may report an error on; ``typeof`` if the annotation creates a dependency with another declaration or; variable. For example, the compiler reports an error on ``typeof(p1)`` shown in; the following code because allowing it can potentially create another type; dependent on the parameter ``size`` in a different context (Please note that an; external bounds annotation on a parameter may only refer to another parameter of; the same function). On the other hand, ``typeof(p2)`` works resulting in ``int; *__counted_by(10)``, since it doesn't depend on any other declaration. ..

Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ErrorInfo utility, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class BadFileFormat : public ErrorInfo<BadFileFormat> {; public:; static char ID;; std::string Path;.

Tab completion, output and graphics inlining have been added. These functionalities are automatically available upon import of the ROOT module in a Notebook or at startup of a ROOT prompt kernel.; We made it easier to use ROOT notebooks locally, by providing a 'root --notebook' command option to start a local notebook server customised with all the ROOT features. New tutorials and code examples have been provided. The simplest example showing the integration of ROOT with the notebook technology can be found [here](https://root.cern.ch/notebooks/HowTos/HowTo_ROOT-Notebooks.html) and many more snippets [here](https://root.cern.ch/code-examples#notebooks).

This is a wrapper for the *QUADPACK* integrator implemented in the GSL library. It supports several integration methods that can be chosen in construction time.; The default type is adaptive integration with singularity applying a Gauss-Kronrod 21-point integration rule. For a detail description of the GSL methods visit the GSL user guide; This class implements the best algorithms for numerical integration for one dimensional functions. We encourage the use it as the main option, bearing in mind that it uses code from the; GSL library, wich is provided in the *MathMore* library of ROOT. The interface to use is the same as above. We have now the possibility to specify a different integration algorithm in the constructor of the `ROOT::Math::GSLIntegrator` class.; ```{.cpp}; // create the adaptive integrator with the 51 point rule; ROOT::Math::GSLIntegrator ig(ROOT::Math::Integration::kADAPTIVE, ROOT::Math::Integration::kGAUSS51);; ig.SetRelTolerance(1.E-6); // set relative tolerance; ig.SetAbsTolerance(1.E-6); // set absoulte tolerance; ```. The algorithm is controlled by the given absolute and relative tolerance. The iterations are continued until the following condition is satisfied; $$; absErr <= max ( epsAbs, epsRel * Integral); $$; Where *absErr* is an estimate of the absolute error (it can be retrieved with `GSLIntegrator::Error()`) and *Integral* is the estimate of the function integral; (it can be obtained with `GSLIntegrator::Result()`). The possible integration algorithm types to use with the GSLIntegrator are the following. More information is provided in the `GSL` users documentation.; * `ROOT::Math::Integration::kNONADAPTIVE` : based on `gsl_integration_qng`.

The result of a floating-point operation often cannot be exactly represented in the result type and therefore must be rounded. IEEE 754 describes different rounding modes that control how to perform this rounding, not all of which are supported by all implementations. C provides interfaces (``fesetround`` and ``fesetenv``) for dynamically controlling the rounding mode, and while it also recommends certain conventions for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables.

In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals. The; intention is to keep the interface as stable as possible even when the LLVM; optimizer continues to evolve. It should even be possible for a completely; different compilation technology to provide a different libLTO that works with; their object files and the standard linker tool. ``lto_module_t``; ----------------.

Integrability,"port Library, located in the; source at ``lib/Support`` and ``include/llvm/Support``. The library's purpose; is to shield LLVM from the differences between operating systems for the few; services LLVM needs from the operating system. Much of LLVM is written using; portability features of standard C++. However, in a few areas, system dependent; facilities are needed and the Support Library is the wrapper around those; system calls. By centralizing LLVM's use of operating system interfaces, we make it possible; for the LLVM tool chain and runtime libraries to be more easily ported to new; platforms since (theoretically) only ``lib/Support`` needs to be ported. This; library also unclutters the rest of LLVM from #ifdef use and special cases for; specific operating systems. Such uses are replaced with simple calls to the; interfaces provided in ``include/llvm/Support``. Note that the Support Library is not intended to be a complete operating system; wrapper (such as the Adaptive Communications Environment (ACE) or Apache; Portable Runtime (APR)), but only provides the functionality necessary to; support LLVM. The Support Library was originally referred to as the System Library, written; by Reid Spencer who formulated the design based on similar work originating; from the eXtensible Programming System (XPS). Several people helped with the; effort; especially, Jeff Cohen and Henrik Bach on the Win32 port. Keeping LLVM Portable; =====================. In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective. Don't Include System Headers; ----------------------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header.

For example, the following; two statements create and fill a histogram 10 000 times with a default; Gaussian distribution of `mean` `0` and `sigma` `1` :. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1F h1(""h1"",""Histo from a Gaussian"",100,-3,3);; root[] h1.FillRandom(""gaus"",10000);; ```. **`TH1`**`::GetRandom()` can be used to get a random number; distributed according the contents of a histogram. To fill a histogram; following the distribution in an existing histogram you can use the; second signature of **`TH1`**`::FillRandom()`. Next code snipped; assumes that `h` is an existing histogram (**`TH1`** ). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1F h2(""h2"",""Histo from existing histo"",100,-3,3);; root[] h2.FillRandom(&h1, 1000);; ```. The distribution contained in the histogram `h1` ( **`TH1`** ) is; integrated over the channel contents. It is normalized to one. The; second parameter (1000) indicates how many random numbers are; generated. Getting 1 random number implies:. - Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (say `r1` ). - Find the bin in the normalized integral for `r1`. - Fill histogram channel. You can see below an example of the **`TH1`**`::GetRandom()` method; which can be used to get a random number distributed according; the contents of a histogram. ``` {.cpp}; void getrandomh() {; TH1F *source = new TH1F(""source"",""source hist"",100,-3,3);; source->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);; TH1F *final = new TH1F(""final"",""final hist"",100,-3,3);. // continued... for (Int_t i=0;i<10000;i++) {; final->Fill(source->GetRandom());; }; TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"",""c1"",800,1000);; c1->Divide(1,2);; c1->cd(1);; source->Draw();; c1->cd(2);; final->Draw();; c1->cd();; }; ```. ## Adding, Dividing, and Multiplying.

In addition, specifically when dealing with ``void*`` returns, you can use; NumPy's low-level ``frombuffer`` interface to perform the cast.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppdef(""""""; ... void* create_float_array(int sz) {; ... float* pf = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float)*sz);; ... for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i) pf[i] = 2*i;; ... return pf;; ... }""""""); ...; >>> import numpy as np; >>> NDATA = 8; >>> arr = cppyy.gbl.create_float_array(NDATA); >>> print(arr); <cppyy.LowLevelView object at 0x109f15230>; >>> arr.reshape((NDATA,)) # adjust the llv's size; >>> v = np.frombuffer(arr, dtype=np.float32, count=NDATA) # cast to float; >>> print(len(v)); 8; >>> print(v); array([ 0., 2., 4., 6., 8., 10., 12., 14.], dtype=float32); >>>.

How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them. Each instance of a MnMigrad object maintains its own; state and one can have multiple instances of MnMigrad objects. ### M fails to find a minimum ###. If M fails to find a minimum, the user is notified by a warning message; issued by M when running into troubles. Problems can be:. - a bug in M. - an error in the $\mbox{FCN}$. - a highly difficult problem (usually strong correlations among; parameters). - floating–point precision. ## The output from minimization ##. ### The FunctionMinimum ###.

Avoid using the :ref:`assume intrinsic <int_assume>` until you've; established that a) there's no other way to express the given fact and b); that fact is critical for optimization purposes. Assumes are a great; prototyping mechanism, but they can have negative effects on both compile; time and optimization effectiveness. The former is fixable with enough; effort, but the later is fairly fundamental to their designed purpose. Describing Language Specific Properties; =======================================. When translating a source language to LLVM, finding ways to express concepts; and guarantees available in your source language which are not natively; provided by LLVM IR will greatly improve LLVM's ability to optimize your code.; As an example, C/C++'s ability to mark every add as ""no signed wrap (nsw)"" goes; a long way to assisting the optimizer in reasoning about loop induction; variables and thus generating more optimal code for loops. The LLVM LangRef includes a number of mechanisms for annotating the IR with; additional semantic information. It is *strongly* recommended that you become; highly familiar with this document. The list below is intended to highlight a; couple of items of particular interest, but is by no means exhaustive. Restricted Operation Semantics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; #. Add nsw/nuw flags as appropriate. Reasoning about overflow is; generally hard for an optimizer so providing these facts from the frontend; can be very impactful. #. Use fast-math flags on floating point operations if legal. If you don't; need strict IEEE floating point semantics, there are a number of additional; optimizations that can be performed. This can be highly impactful for; floating point intensive computations. Describing Aliasing Properties; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #.

However,; there have been issues with this bridge working correctly in the past,; so it's not clear if this is something that will be supported going forward. Monorepo Drawbacks; ------------------. * Using the monolithic repository may add overhead for those contributing to a; standalone sub-project, particularly on runtimes like libcxx and compiler-rt; that don't rely on LLVM; currently, a fresh clone of libcxx is only 15MB (vs.; 1GB for the monorepo), and the commit rate of LLVM may cause more frequent; `git push` collisions when upstreaming. Affected contributors may be able to; use the SVN bridge or the single-subproject Git mirrors. However, it's; undecided if these projects will continue to be maintained.; * Using the monolithic repository may add overhead for those *integrating* a; standalone sub-project, even if they aren't contributing to it, due to the; same disk space concern as the point above. The availability of the; sub-project Git mirrors would addresses this.; * Preservation of the existing read/write SVN-based workflows relies on the; GitHub SVN bridge, which is an extra dependency. Maintaining this locks us; into GitHub and could restrict future workflow changes.

To have a tool bar in your application you do not need to do anything; special - only to create objects: a tool bar and its picture buttons.; This sample code creates the following three toolbar buttons:. ![](pictures/03000218.png). First we need to complete a `ToolBarData_t` structure for each tool bar; button before adding it to the tool bar. This structure contains:. - the icon file name ""`filename.xpm`"". - the tool tip text - a short help message explaining the button; purpose. - the Boolean variable defining the button behavior when is clicked. - `kFALSE` - do not stay down. - `kTRUE` - to stay down. - the button ID. - the button pointer (**`TGButton *`**) - should be `NULL`. We create an array `*xpms[]` containing the icon file names that will be; used for a picture button creation. If you write only the file names; here ROOT will search these files in `$ROOTSYS/icons` directory. If the; icon files are not there, you should provide the full path name also.; The array `*tips[] `contains the tool tip texts for buttons. The integer; variable separator is used to set the distance between two groups of; toolbar buttons. It defines the amount of pixels to the left for each; button. We create a tool bar object and add the buttons using the `AddButton`; method.

With this version we introduce a new module, core/multiproc, for multi-processing on multi-core machines. This module is based on fork technology and offers an interface inspired from Python multiprocessor module. The new interface, implemented in the class TProcPool, provides the possibility to perform in parallel a very generic set of tasks, described by macros, functions or lambdas. This illustrates the usage of lambdas:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TProcPool pool;; auto ten = pool.MapReduce([]() { return 1; }, 10, [](std::vector<int> v) { return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); }); }; ```.

TH1F *h = new TH1F(""h"", """", 100, -3., 3.);; h->SetDirectory(0);; h->FillRandom(""gaus"", 1000);; return h;; }. TProcPool pool;; auto hist = pool.MapReduce(CreateAndFillHists, 10, PoolUtils::ReduceObjects);; hist->DrawClone();; }; ```.

The intent of the second rule is to say that objects held in normal; ``__strong`` local variables may be released as soon as the value in; the variable is no longer being used: either the variable stops; being used completely or a new value is stored in the variable. The intent of the third rule is to say that return values may be; released after they've been used. A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``.

The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence.

Integrability,"quests and Force Pushes; ---------------------------------------; In general, you should avoid rebasing a Pull Request and force pushing to the; branch that's the root of the Pull Request during the review.

Landing your change; -------------------; When your PR has been accepted you can use the web interface to land your change.; If you have created multiple commits to address feedback at this point you need; to consolidate those commits into one commit. There are two different ways to; do this:. `Interactive rebase <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode>`_; with fixup's. This is the recommended method since you can control the final; commit message and inspect that the final commit looks as you expect. When; your local state is correct, remember to force-push to your branch and press; the merge button afterwards. Use the button `Squash and merge` in GitHub's web interface, if you do this; remember to review the commit message when prompted. Afterwards you can select the option `Delete branch` to delete the branch; from your fork. You can also merge via the CLI by switching to your branch locally and run:. ::. gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch.

The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");. Both clang and GAS accept the first instruction: because the first; instruction uses the 8-bit %al register as an operand, it is clear that; it is an 8-bit add. The second instruction is accepted by both because the ""w""; suffix indicates that it is a 16-bit add. The last instruction is accepted by; GAS even though there is nothing that specifies the size of the instruction (and; the assembler randomly picks a 32-bit add). Because it is ambiguous, Clang; rejects the instruction with this error message:. <inline asm>:3:1: error: ambiguous instructions require an explicit suffix (could be 'addb', 'addw', 'addl', or 'addq'); add $4, (%rax); ^.

Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file; (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object; file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object; formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. .

The difference between SetVector and other sets is that the order of iteration; is guaranteed to match the order of insertion into the SetVector. This property; is really important for things like sets of pointers. Because pointer values; are non-deterministic (e.g. vary across runs of the program on different; machines), iterating over the pointers in the set will not be in a well-defined; order. The drawback of SetVector is that it requires twice as much space as a normal; set and has the sum of constant factors from the set-like container and the; sequential container that it uses. Use it **only** if you need to iterate over; the elements in a deterministic order.

The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller.

Integrability,"r example, an expression; like ``X[a][b][c]``, must be effectively lowered into a form like; ``X[a*m+b*n+c]``, so that it appears to the GEP as a single-dimensional array; reference. This means if you want to write an analysis which understands array indices and; you want to support VLAs, your code will have to be prepared to reverse-engineer; the linearization. One way to solve this problem is to use the ScalarEvolution; library, which always presents VLA and non-VLA indexing in the same manner. .. _Rules:. Rules; =====. What happens if an array index is out of bounds?; ------------------------------------------------. There are two senses in which an array index can be out of bounds. First, there's the array type which comes from the (static) type of the first; operand to the GEP. Indices greater than the number of elements in the; corresponding static array type are valid. There is no problem with out of; bounds indices in this sense. Indexing into an array only depends on the size of; the array element, not the number of elements. A common example of how this is used is arrays where the size is not known.; It's common to use array types with zero length to represent these. The fact; that the static type says there are zero elements is irrelevant; it's perfectly; valid to compute arbitrary element indices, as the computation only depends on; the size of the array element, not the number of elements. Note that zero-sized; arrays are not a special case here. This sense is unconnected with ``inbounds`` keyword. The ``inbounds`` keyword is; designed to describe low-level pointer arithmetic overflow conditions, rather; than high-level array indexing rules. Analysis passes which wish to understand array indexing should not assume that; the static array type bounds are respected. The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:12799,depend,depends,12799,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,; scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory; model. See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.; * The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache shared by all CUs on; the same agent.; * The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual; addresses.; * Each CU has a separate request queue per channel. Therefore, the vector and; scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different; work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be; reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to; ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs.

Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch.

You can select a single shape from your scene by pressing ‘Shift' key,; pointing and left clicking anywhere on the shape in the viewer.; Selection is currently shown by drawing the shape-bounding box (not; depth clipped) in white (polygon or wire frame render styles) or red; (outline render style). Manipulators supported by the shape are drawn in; red, green and blue while the non-supported ones are drawn in grey. To; deselect a shape, either select another, or shift/click anywhere on the; background (empty space) in the viewer. You cannot select Manipulators; or Guides (Axes / Reference Marker). #### Editing Shapes. When a shape is selected, the viewer's control pane shows the user; interface that allows you to review and adjust the color and geometry; properties of the shape. Note: At present modifications to the shapes are local to the viewer -; they are not propagated back to external objects/client that published; to the viewer. The changes are preserved only until the viewer is; closed. In some cases, this will never be feasible as there is not a; one-to-one correspondence between a shape in the viewer and a single; external object in which the modification could be stored. #### Colors / Style. Viewer Controls Pane ‘Style' tab. A full description of OpenGL materials, colors and lighting is beyond; the scope of this document. You should refer to the OpenGL programming; manual (Red Book) for a full discussion. In most cases adjustment of the; Diffuse color material + Opacity/Shine properties is sufficient to; achieve desired results.

A **`TFolder`** can contain other folders as shown above or any; **`TObject`** descendents. In general, users will not post a single; object to a folder; they will store a collection or multiple collections; in a folder. For example, to add an array to a folder:. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray *array;; run_mc->Add(array);; ```. ### Reading Data from a Folder (Consumer). One can search for a folder or an object in a folder using the; `TROOT::FindObjectAny` method. It analyzes the string passed as its; argument and searches in the hierarchy until it finds an object or; folder matching the name.

For example, if the user specifies; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m4`` the toolchain can choose a directory; containing headers and libraries suitable for Armv7E-M, because it knows that's; a suitable architecture for Arm Cortex-M4.; Multilib can also choose between libraries for the same architecture based on; other options. For example if the user specifies ``-fno-exceptions`` then a; toolchain could select libraries built without exception support, thereby; reducing the size of the resulting binary. Design; ======. Clang supports GCC's ``-print-multi-lib`` and ``-print-multi-directory``; options. These are described in; `GCC Developer Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_. There are two ways to configure multilib in Clang: hard-coded or via a; configuration file. Hard-coded Multilib; ===================. The available libraries can be hard-coded in Clang. Typically this is done; using the ``MultilibBuilder`` interface in; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/MultilibBuilder.h``.; There are many examples of this in ``lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp``.; The remainder of this document will not focus on this type of multilib. EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst:1686,interface,interface,1686,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"r stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible. In that case, we need to preserve; the flags around these instructions:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; pushfq; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rdx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; popfq; movl (%rcx,%rdx), %edi; ```. Using the `pushf` and `popf` instructions saves the flags register around our; inserted code, but comes at a high cost. First, we must store the flags to the; stack and reload them. Second, this causes the stack pointer to be adjusted; dynamically, requiring a frame pointer be used for referring to temporaries; spilled to the stack, etc. On newer x86 processors we can use the `lahf` and `sahf` instructions to save;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:32118,depend,dependency,32118,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['depend'],['dependency']
Integrability,"r to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread. When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This; thread is called the initial thread or the main thread. The initial; thread executes the main routine in multi-threaded programs. Note: At the end of this chapter is a glossary of thread specific terms. ## Implementation of Threads in ROOT. The **`TThread`** class has been developed to provide a platform; independent interface to threads for ROOT. ### Installation. For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version; of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations.; We hope that this will become the default later. To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):. ```; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; ```. This configures and builds ROOT using `/usr/lib/libpthread.so` as the; `Pthread` library, and defines `R__THREAD`. This enables the thread specific treatment of *`gPad`*, and creates; `$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.`. Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate; ROOT keyword for your platform. ### Classes. **`TThread`** class implements threads . The platform dependent; implementation is in the **`TThreadImp`** class and its descendant; classes (e.g. **`TPosixThread`** ). **`TMutex`** class implements `mutex` locks. A mutex is a mutually; exclusive lock. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** class and its descendant classes (e.g.; **`TPosixMutex`**). **`TCondition`** class implements a condition variable. Use a condition; variable to signal threads. The platform dependent implementation is in; the **`TConditionImp`** and **`TPosixCondition`** classes . **`TSemaphore`** class implements a counting semaphore. Use a semaphore",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md:3192,depend,depend,3192,documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,1,['depend'],['depend']

Now that it's all together, compile the file with a simple ""``gmake``"" command; from the top level of your build directory and you should get a new file; ""``lib/LLVMHello.so``"". Note that everything in this file is; contained in an anonymous namespace --- this reflects the fact that passes; are self contained units that do not need external interfaces (although they; can have them) to be useful. Running a pass with ``opt``; ---------------------------. Now that you have a brand new shiny shared object file, we can use the; :program:`opt` command to run an LLVM program through your pass. Because you; registered your pass with ``RegisterPass``, you will be able to use the; :program:`opt` tool to access it, once loaded. To test it, follow the example at the end of the :doc:`GettingStarted` to; compile ""Hello World"" to LLVM. We can now run the bitcode file (hello.bc) for; the program through our transformation like this (or course, any bitcode file; will work):. .. code-block:: console. $ opt -load lib/LLVMHello.so -hello < hello.bc > /dev/null; Hello: __main; Hello: puts; Hello: main.

Integrability,"r. The C interface was designed to require very little memory; management, and so is straightforward in this regard. What support is there for a higher level source language constructs for building a compiler?; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; Currently, there isn't much. LLVM supports an intermediate representation; which is useful for code representation but will not support the high level; (abstract syntax tree) representation needed by most compilers. There are no; facilities for lexical nor semantic analysis. I don't understand the ``GetElementPtr`` instruction. Help!; -----------------------------------------------------------; See `The Often Misunderstood GEP Instruction <GetElementPtr.html>`_. Using the C and C++ Front Ends; ==============================. Can I compile C or C++ code to platform-independent LLVM bitcode?; -----------------------------------------------------------------; No. C and C++ are inherently platform-dependent languages. The most obvious; example of this is the preprocessor. A very common way that C code is made; portable is by using the preprocessor to include platform-specific code. In; practice, information about other platforms is lost after preprocessing, so; the result is inherently dependent on the platform that the preprocessing was; targeting. Another example is ``sizeof``. It's common for ``sizeof(long)`` to vary; between platforms. In most C front-ends, ``sizeof`` is expanded to a; constant immediately, thus hard-wiring a platform-specific detail. Also, since many platforms define their ABIs in terms of C, and since LLVM is; lower-level than C, front-ends currently must emit platform-specific IR in; order to have the result conform to the platform ABI. Questions about code generated by the demo page; ===============================================.

You can always confirm the orientation; and constraints of the camera in the world by enabling axis drawing in; the ""Guides"" tab - see sections ""Guides"" and ""Clipping"" below. For; orthographic camera a ruler-depicting current scene units is also; available. You can also pick the current camera by obtaining a handle to the GL; Viewer object behind the interface:. ``` {.cpp}; TGLViewer * v = (TGLViewer *)gPad->GetViewer3D();; ```. calling the method `TGLViewer::SetCurrentCamera` with one of the; **`TGLViewer::ECameraType` types:**. ``` {.cpp}; v->SetCurrentCamera(TGLViewer::kCameraPerspXOZ);; ```.

It uses the most basic Gaussian integration algorithm, it uses the 8-point and the 16-point Gaussian; quadrature approximations. It is derived from the `DGAUSS` routine of the *CERNLIB* by S.

It is important to note that; transformations act differently on vectors and points. The vectors only; rotate, therefore when applying a transformation (rotation +; translation) on a vector, only the rotation operates while the; translation has no effect. The **`Transform3D`** class interface is; similar to the one used in the CLHEP Geometry package (class; <HepGeom::Transform3D>). - Lorentz rotation:. - generic Lorentz rotation described by a `4x4` matrix containing a 3D; rotation part and a boost part (class; **`ROOT::Math::LorentzRotation`**). - a pure boost in an arbitrary direction and described by a 4x4; symmetric matrix or 10 numbers (class **`ROOT::Math::Boost`**). - boost along the axis:` x `(**`ROOT::Math::BoostX`**),; `y `(**`ROOT::Math::BoostY`**) and `z `(**`ROOT::Math::BoostZ`**). #### Minimal Vector Classes Interface. We have tried to keep the interface to a minimal level by:. - Avoiding methods that provide the same functionality but use; different names (like `getX()` and `x()`). - Minimizing the number of setter methods, avoiding methods, which can; be ambiguous and can set the vector classes in an inconsistent; state. We provide only methods which set all the coordinates at the; same time or set only the coordinates on which the vector is based,; for example `SetX()` for a Cartesian vector. We then enforce the use; of transformations as rotations or translations (additions) for; modifying the vector contents. - The majority of the functionality, which is present in the CLHEP; package, involving operations on two vectors, is moved in separated; helper functions (see `ROOT::Math::VectorUtil`). This has the; advantage that the basic interface will remain more stable with time; while additional functions can be added easily. #### Naming Convention.

The above figure shows a divergent branch ``Q`` inside an irreducible; cyclic region. When two threads diverge at ``Q``, the convergence of; dynamic instances within the cyclic region depends on the cycle; hierarchy chosen:. 1. In an implementation that detects a single cycle ``C`` with header; ``P``, convergence inside the cycle is determined by ``P``. 2. In an implementation that detects two nested cycles with headers; ``R`` and ``S``, convergence inside those cycles is determined by; their respective headers. .. _convergence-diverged-entry:. A conservative approach would be to simply report all nodes inside; irreducible cycles as having divergent outputs. But it is desirable to; recognize m-converged nodes in the CFG in order to maximize; uniformity. This section describes one such pattern of nodes derived; from *closed paths*, which are a property of the CFG and do not depend; on the cycle hierarchy. **Diverged Entry Criterion:**. The dynamic instances of all the nodes in a closed path ``P`` are; m-converged only if for every divergent branch ``B`` and its; join node ``J`` that lie on ``P``, there is no entry to ``P`` which; lies on a diverged path from ``B`` to ``J``. .. figure:: convergence-closed-path.png; :name: convergence-closed-path.

To add or remove an instruction from a basic block, we need to get an ; iterator to an instruction, which, given just an Instruction*, requires a ; linear search of the basic block the instruction is contained in... just ; to insert an instruction before another instruction, or to delete an ; instruction! This complicates algorithms that should be very simple (like ; simple constant propagation), because they aren't actually sparse anymore,; they have to traverse basic blocks to remove constant propogated ; instructions. Additionally, adding or removing instructions to a basic block ; _invalidates all iterators_ pointing into that block, which is really ; irritating. To fix these problems (and others), I would like to make the ordering of; the instructions be represented with a doubly linked list in the; instructions themselves, instead of an external data structure. This is ; how many other representations do it, and frankly I can't remember why I ; originally implemented it the way I did. Long term, all of the code that depends on the nasty features in the ; instruction list (which can be found by grep'ing for getInstList()) will ; be changed to do nice local transformations. In the short term, I'll ; change the representation, but preserve the interface (including ; getInstList()) so that all of the code doesn't have to change. Iteration over the instructions in a basic block remains the simple:; for (BasicBlock::iterator I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I) ... But we will also support:; for (Instruction *I = BB->front(); I; I = I->getNext()) ... After converting instructions over, I'll convert basic blocks and ; functions to have a similar interface.

Here are tasks that are on our todo lists since a while, but we still cannot manage to get them done. They are not difficult to implement and excellent for getting to know cling. If you find something interesting, please go ahead and get your hands dirty!; The list is prioritized in descending order:; Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.; Implementing auto completion - Clang has good interface for autocompletion which proposes possible completion options considering the current input.; Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST.

If the partial path; name is unique, it will find it; otherwise it will return the first; occurrence of the path. The first diagram shows a system without folders. The objects have; pointers to each other to access each other's data. Pointers are an; efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer; creates a direct coupling between classes. This design can become a very; tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. ![](pictures/020000E2.jpg). In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the; consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data.; The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy; provides an alternative.

The example below illustrates this; point. ## How to Use Folders. Using folders means to build a hierarchy of folders, posting the; reference to the data in the folder by the producer, and creating a; reference to the folder by the user. ### Creating a Folder Hierarchy. To create a folder hierarchy you add the top folder of your hierarchy to; `//root`. Then you add a folder to an existing folder with the; **`TFolder::AddFolder`** method. This method takes two parameters: the; name and title of the folder to be added. It returns a pointer of the; newly created folder. The code below creates the folder hierarchy shown in the browser.

Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`. The record includes an ID, allowing; the runtime to uniquely identify the stack map, and the offset within; the code from the beginning of the enclosing function.

For a TF1 defining a multidimensional function or in case we need to wrap in a multi-dimensional function interface, the class to use is `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1`.; Following the usual procedure, setting the `TF1` though the constructor, will wrap it into a `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim`.; Example:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""TF1.h""; #include ""Math/WrappedMultiTF1.h"". int main(); {.

These limitations impose restrictions on what you can test with the MIR format.; For now, tests that would like to test some behaviour that depends on the state; of temporary or local ``MCSymbol`` operands or the exception handling state in; MMI, can't use the MIR format.

Integrability,"rical types, (; see issue in ROOT forum). When reading more than one TStreamerInfo for the same versioned; class, we now use the highest possible class version as the current; version of the class. Practically, we update the class version; when reading new (higher versioned) StreamerInfo until the Class; is actually used (i.e. TClass::GetClassVersion is call directly; or indirectly). In particular, if a file has several StreamerInfos for the same; versioned class, we will use the highest version number as the; 'current' class version (as opposed to the lowest until now). For backward compatibility TStreamerInfo::BuildCheck compares the checksum of; the on-file StreamerInfo not only to the current value of the class checksum; but also to the checksum calculated using the older algorithms. This patch extends this test to also be done when comparing 2 on-file StreamerInfos. This removes spurrious warning message when loading 2 older files which; were written with 2 different version of the TClass CheckSum algorithm; (and the in-memory class's version is greater than both TStreamerInfos'; class version).

Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small.

In addition to simple scalar arguments,; the CommandLine library also provides primitives to support CommandLine option; `aliases`_, and `lists`_ of options. .. _aliases:.

So far, the example works well, except for the fact that we need to check the; quiet condition like this now:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet && !Quiet2) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is a real pain! Instead of defining two values for the same; condition, we can use the ""`cl::alias`_"" class to make the ""``-q``"" option an; **alias** for the ""``-quiet``"" option, instead of providing a value itself:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Overwrite output files""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::alias QuietA(""q"", cl::desc(""Alias for -quiet""), cl::aliasopt(Quiet));. The third line (which is the only one we modified from above) defines a ""``-q``""; alias that updates the ""``Quiet``"" variable (as specified by the `cl::aliasopt`_; modifier) whenever it is specified. Because aliases do not hold state, the only; thing the program has to query is the ``Quiet`` variable now. Another nice; feature of aliases is that they automatically hide themselves from the ``-help``; output (although, again, they are still visible in the ``-help-hidden output``). Now the application code can simply use:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is much nicer!

See `SetMakeSharedLib()`; for more information on those variables.

You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead.

There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics,; Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI),; Socket and Network Communication, Threads. #### Advantages of Frameworks. The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. - Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and; reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such; as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and; customize. - More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a; framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of; the framework. - More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides; consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter; who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into; smaller pieces. - More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their; particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at; writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the; frameworks that provide those services. ### Why Object-Oriented?. Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to; Procedure-Oriented Programming:. - Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity; for reuse. - Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify; objects. - Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide; a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the; relationships among them. - Complexity is reduced because there is little growth of the global; state, the state is contained within each object, rather than; scattered through the program in the form of global variables. - Objects may come and go, but the basic structure of the program; remains relatively static, increases opportunity for reuse of; design. ## Installing ROOT; \index{install ROOT}.

It is also; convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text; editor for use in your own macros. ### ROOT Global Pointers ###. All global pointers in ROOT begin with a small ""g"". Some of them were; already implicitly introduced (for example in the section; [Configure ROOT at start-up](#configure-root-at-start-up)).; The most important among them are presented in the following:. - **[gROOT](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTROOT.html)**: the `gROOT`; variable is the entry point to the ROOT system. Technically it is an; instance of the `TROOT` class. Using the `gROOT` pointer one has; access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program.; The `TROOT` object is essentially a container of several lists; pointing to the main `ROOT` objects. - **[gStyle](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTStyle.html)**: By default; ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the `gStyle`; pointer. This class includes functions to set some of the following; object attributes. - Canvas; - Pad; - Histogram axis; - Lines; - Fill areas; - Text; - Markers; - Functions; - Histogram Statistics and Titles; - etc ... - **[gSystem](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSystem.html)**: An; instance of a base class defining a generic interface to the; underlying Operating System, in our case `TUnixSystem`. - **[gInterpreter](http://root.cern.ch/htmldoc/html/TInterpreter.html)**: The; entry point for the ROOT interpreter. Technically an abstraction level; over a singleton instance of `TCling`. At this point you have already learnt quite a bit about some basic; features of ROOT. ***Please move on to become an expert!***. [^2]: All ROOT classes' names start with the letter T.

Integrability,"rors``; function so that it can be handled itself, or propagated up the stack. .. _err_exitonerr:. Using ExitOnError to simplify tool code; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Library code should never call ``exit`` for a recoverable error, however in tool; code (especially command line tools) this can be a reasonable approach. Calling; ``exit`` upon encountering an error dramatically simplifies control flow as the; error no longer needs to be propagated up the stack. This allows code to be; written in straight-line style, as long as each fallible call is wrapped in a; check and call to exit. The ``ExitOnError`` class supports this pattern by; providing call operators that inspect ``Error`` values, stripping the error away; in the success case and logging to ``stderr`` then exiting in the failure case. To use this class, declare a global ``ExitOnError`` variable in your program:. .. code-block:: c++. ExitOnError ExitOnErr;. Calls to fallible functions can then be wrapped with a call to ``ExitOnErr``,; turning them into non-failing calls:. .. code-block:: c++. Error mayFail();; Expected<int> mayFail2();. void foo() {; ExitOnErr(mayFail());; int X = ExitOnErr(mayFail2());; }. On failure, the error's log message will be written to ``stderr``, optionally; preceded by a string ""banner"" that can be set by calling the setBanner method. A; mapping can also be supplied from ``Error`` values to exit codes using the; ``setExitCodeMapper`` method:. .. code-block:: c++. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; ExitOnErr.setBanner(std::string(argv[0]) + "" error:"");; ExitOnErr.setExitCodeMapper(; [](const Error &Err) {; if (Err.isA<BadFileFormat>()); return 2;; return 1;; });.

Integrability,"ross-inheritance`; ----------------------------. Python requires that any multiple inheritance (also in pure Python) has an; unambiguous method resolution order (mro), including for classes and thus; also for meta-classes.; In Python2, it was possible to resolve any mro conflicts automatically, but; meta-classes in Python3, although syntactically richer, have functionally; become far more limited.; In particular, the mro is checked in the builtin class builder, instead of; in the meta-class of the meta-class (which in Python3 is the builtin ``type``; rather than the meta-class itself as in Python2, another limitation, and; which actually checks the mro a second time for no reason).; The upshot is that a helper is required (``cppyy.multi``) to resolve the mro; to support Python3.; The helper is written to also work in Python2.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> class PyConcrete(cppyy.multi(cppyy.gbl.Abstract1, cppyy.gbl.Abstract2)):; ... def abstract_method1(self):; ... return ""first message""; ... def abstract_method2(self):; ... return ""second message""; ...; >>> pc = PyConcrete(); >>> cppyy.gbl.call_abstract_method1(pc); first message; >>> cppyy.gbl/call_abstract_method2(pc); second message; >>>. Contrary to multiple inheritance in Python, in C++ there are no two separate; instances representing the base classes.; Thus, a single ``__init__`` call needs to construct and initialize all bases,; rather than calling ``__init__`` on each base independently.; To support this syntax, the arguments to each base class should be grouped; together in a tuple.; If there are no arguments, provide an empty tuple (or omit them altogether,; if these arguments apply to the right-most base(s)). .. _sec-methods-label:. `Methods`; ---------.

Integrability,"routine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread. When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This; thread is called the initial thread or the main thread. The initial; thread executes the main routine in multi-threaded programs. Note: At the end of this chapter is a glossary of thread specific terms. ## Implementation of Threads in ROOT. The **`TThread`** class has been developed to provide a platform; independent interface to threads for ROOT. ### Installation. For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version; of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations.; We hope that this will become the default later. To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):. ```; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; ```. This configures and builds ROOT using `/usr/lib/libpthread.so` as the; `Pthread` library, and defines `R__THREAD`. This enables the thread specific treatment of *`gPad`*, and creates; `$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.`. Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate; ROOT keyword for your platform. ### Classes. **`TThread`** class implements threads .

Designing Type Hierarchies and Polymorphic Interfaces; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two different design patterns that tend to result in the use of; virtual dispatch for methods in a type hierarchy in C++ programs. The first is; a genuine type hierarchy where different types in the hierarchy model; a specific subset of the functionality and semantics, and these types nest; strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen in the ``Value``; or ``Type`` type hierarchies. A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of; polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be modeled with; virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract interface base class; which all implementations derive from and override. However, this; implementation strategy forces an **""is-a""** relationship to exist that is not; actually meaningful. There is often not some nested hierarchy of useful; generalizations which code might interact with and move up and down. Instead,; there is a singular interface which is dispatched across a range of; implementations. The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of; generic programming (sometimes called ""compile-time duck typing"" or ""static; polymorphism""). For example, a template over some type parameter ``T`` can be; instantiated across any particular implementation that conforms to the; interface or *concept*. A good example here is the highly generic properties of; any type which models a node in a directed graph. LLVM models these primarily; through templates and generic programming. Such templates include the; ``LoopInfoBase`` and ``DominatorTreeBase``.

Using the upper xmm registers (xmm8-xmm15) forces a longer instruction encoding; which may put greater pressure on the frontend fetch and decode stages,; potentially reducing the rate that instructions are dispatched to the backend,; particularly on older hardware. Comparing baseline results with this mode; enabled can help determine the effects of the frontend and can be used to; improve latency and throughput estimates. .. option:: --repetition-mode=[duplicate|loop|min]. Specify the repetition mode. `duplicate` will create a large, straight line; basic block with `num-repetitions` instructions (repeating the snippet; `num-repetitions`/`snippet size` times). `loop` will, optionally, duplicate the; snippet until the loop body contains at least `loop-body-size` instructions,; and then wrap the result in a loop which will execute `num-repetitions`; instructions (thus, again, repeating the snippet; `num-repetitions`/`snippet size` times). The `loop` mode, especially with loop; unrolling tends to better hide the effects of the CPU frontend on architectures; that cache decoded instructions, but consumes a register for counting; iterations. If performing an analysis over many opcodes, it may be best to; instead use the `min` mode, which will run each other mode,; and produce the minimal measured result. .. option:: --num-repetitions=<Number of repetitions>.

The returned node; is the next crossed one, but the physical path (state) AFTER crossing; the boundary is not determined. In order to find out this new state, one; has to propagate the point with a distance slightly bigger that the; computed step value (which is accurate within numerical precision). A; method that performs this task finding the next location is; `TGeoManager::Step()`, described in "" Making a Step "", but users may; implement more precise methods to insure post-step boundary crossing. ## Geometry Graphical User Interface. The geombuilder package allows you to create and edit geometries. The; package provides a library of all GUI classes related to geometry. Each; editable geometry class **`TGeoXXX`** have a correspondent editor; **`TGeoXXXEditor`** that provides a graphics user interface allowing to; edit some (or all) parameters of a geometry object. The editable objects; are geometry manager, volumes, nodes, shapes, media, materials and; matrices. The interfaces provide also access to specific functionality; of geometry objects. The editing mechanism is based on ROOT GED; (Graphics Editors) functionality and the library is loaded using the; plug-in mechanism. ### Editing a Geometry. There are two different use cases having different ways of invoking the; geometry editors. The first one applies when starting with geometry from; scratch and using the builder functionality to create new geometry; objects. In this case, one should use the sequence:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoManager *geom = new TGeoManager(""MyGeom"",; ""Test builder"");; root[] geom->Edit(Option_t *option="""");; ```.

In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------. Implementations of the Support Library interface are separated by their general; class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes are defined; but more could be added for other operating system classifications. To; distinguish which implementation to compile, the code in ``lib/Support`` uses; the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``_WIN32`` ``#defines``. Each source file in; ``lib/Support``, after implementing the generic (operating system independent); functionality needs to include the correct implementation using a set of; ``#if defined(LLVM_ON_XYZ)`` directives.

Quite often, the data volume to be analyzed is large - think of; fine-granular measurements accumulated with the aid of computers. A; usable tool therefore must contain easy-to-use and efficient methods for; storing and handling data. In Quantum mechanics, models typically only predict the probability; density function (""pdf"") of measurements depending on a number of; parameters, and the aim of the experimental analysis is to extract the; parameters from the observed distribution of frequencies at which; certain values of the measurement are observed. Measurements of this; kind require means to generate and visualize frequency distributions,; so-called histograms, and stringent statistical treatment to extract the; model parameters from purely statistical distributions. Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data; analysis. By repeated generation of ""pseudo-data"", which are analysed in; the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can; be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the; measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the; possibility to test the effects of different assumptions.

This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form. This tool should also be added as part of Clang's continuous integration testing; framework, where modifications to the compiler ensure that CFI protection; schemes are still present in the final binary. Location; ========. This tool will be present as a part of the LLVM toolchain, and will reside in; the ""/llvm/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"" directory, relative to the LLVM trunk. It will; be tested in two methods:. - Unit tests to validate code sections, present in; ""/llvm/unittests/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"".; - Integration tests, present in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"". These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type). This type of directive has no security implications, but may present; performance impacts.

If there is a related ivar, there will also be a DWARF property attribute placed; in the ``DW_TAG_member`` DIE for that ivar referring back to the property TAG; for that property.

Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them. When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first. Otherwise, loading the requested library could cause; a system (dynamic loader) error due to unresolved symbols. ### \$ROOTSYS/tutorials. tutorials The tutorials directory contains many example example; scripts. They assume some basic knowledge of ROOT, and for the new; user we recommend reading the chapters: ""Histograms"" and; ""Input/Output"" before trying the examples.

Integrability,"s *myobject;; while ((myobject = (MyClass *)myiter.Next())) {; // process myobject; }; ```. The heart of this is the `myiter.Next()` expression which does the; following:. - The `Next()` method of the **`TIter`** object `myiter` is called. - The **`TIter`** forwards the call to the **`TIterator`** embedded in; the **`TObjArrayIter`**. - **`TIterator`** forwards the call to the **`TObjArrayIter`**. - **`TObjArrayIter`** finds the next `MyClass` object and returns it. - **`TIter`** passes the `MyClass` object back to the caller. ![](pictures/020001A5.jpg). Sometimes the **`TIter`** object is called next, and then instead of; writing: `next.Next() `which is legal, but looks rather odd, iteration; is written as `next()`. This works because the function `operator()` is; defined for the **`TIter`** class to be equivalent to the `Next()`; method. ## The TList Collection. A **`TList`** is a doubly linked list. Before being inserted into the; list the object pointer is wrapped in a **`TObjLink`** object that; contains, besides the object pointer also a previous and next pointer. Objects are typically added using:. - `Add()`. - `AddFirst(), AddLast()`. - `AddBefore(), AddAfter()`. **Main features of`TList`**: very low cost of adding/removing elements; anywhere in the list. **Overhead per element**: 1 `TObjLink`, i.e. two 4 (or 8) byte pointers; + pointer to `vtable` = 12 (or 24) bytes. Next figure shows the internal data structure of a **`TList`**. ![The internal data structure of a TList](pictures/020001A6.jpg). ### Iterating Over a TList.

Field *uOps Per Cycle* is bounded from above by the dispatch width. That is; because the dispatch width limits the maximum size of a dispatch group. Both IPC; and 'uOps Per Cycle' are limited by the amount of hardware parallelism. The; availability of hardware resources affects the resource pressure distribution,; and it limits the number of instructions that can be executed in parallel every; cycle. A delta between Dispatch Width and the theoretical maximum uOps per; Cycle (computed by dividing the number of uOps of a single iteration by the; `Block RThroughput`) is an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the; lack of hardware resources.; In general, the lower the Block RThroughput, the better. In this example, ``uOps per iteration/Block RThroughput`` is 1.50. Since there; are no loop-carried dependencies, the observed `uOps Per Cycle` is expected to; approach 1.50 when the number of iterations tends to infinity. The delta between; the Dispatch Width (2.00), and the theoretical maximum uOp throughput (1.50) is; an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the lack of hardware; resources, and the *Resource pressure view* can help to identify the problematic; resource usage. The second section of the report is the `instruction info view`. It shows the; latency and reciprocal throughput of every instruction in the sequence. It also; reports extra information related to the number of micro opcodes, and opcode; properties (i.e., 'MayLoad', 'MayStore', and 'HasSideEffects'). Field *RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the instruction throughput. Throughput; is computed as the maximum number of instructions of a same type that can be; executed per clock cycle in the absence of operand dependencies. In this; example, the reciprocal throughput of a vector float multiply is 1; cycles/instruction.

For instance, in a previous example we showed how the conversion type for a; flags field could be determined at runtime based on the value of another field; in the mapping. But what if an inner mapping needs to know some field value; of an outer mapping? That is where the ""context"" parameter comes in. You; can set values in the context in the outer map's mapping() method and; retrieve those values in the inner map's mapping() method. The context value is just a void*. All your traits which use the context; and operate on your native data types, need to agree what the context value; actually is. It could be a pointer to an object or struct which your various; traits use to shared context sensitive information. Output; ======. The llvm::yaml::Output class is used to generate a YAML document from your; in-memory data structures, using traits defined on your data types.; To instantiate an Output object you need an llvm::raw_ostream, an optional; context pointer and an optional wrapping column:. .. code-block:: c++. class Output : public IO {; public:; Output(llvm::raw_ostream &, void *context = NULL, int WrapColumn = 70);. Once you have an Output object, you can use the C++ stream operator on it; to write your native data as YAML. One thing to recall is that a YAML file; can contain multiple ""documents"". If the top level data structure you are; streaming as YAML is a mapping, scalar, or sequence, then Output assumes you; are generating one document and wraps the mapping output; with ""``---``"" and trailing ""``...``"". The WrapColumn parameter will cause the flow mappings and sequences to; line-wrap when they go over the supplied column. Pass 0 to completely; suppress the wrapping. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::Output;. void dumpMyMapDoc(const MyMapType &info) {; Output yout(llvm::outs());; yout << info;; }.

Integrability,"s a store into multiple stores,; narrows a store, or stores a value which would not be stored otherwise. Some; examples of unsafe optimizations are narrowing an assignment into a bitfield,; rematerializing a load, and turning loads and stores into a memcpy; call. Reordering unordered operations is safe, though, and optimizers should; take advantage of that because unordered operations are common in languages; that need them. Notes for code generation; These operations are required to be atomic in the sense that if you use; unordered loads and unordered stores, a load cannot see a value which was; never stored. A normal load or store instruction is usually sufficient, but; note that an unordered load or store cannot be split into multiple; instructions (or an instruction which does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM). Monotonic; ---------. Monotonic is the weakest level of atomicity that can be used in synchronization; primitives, although it does not provide any general synchronization. It; essentially guarantees that if you take all the operations affecting a specific; address, a consistent ordering exists. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution. The; guarantees in terms of synchronization are very weak, so make sure these are; only used in a pattern which you know is correct. Generally, these would; either be used for atomic operations which do not protect other memory (like; an atomic counter), or along with a ``fence``. Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this can be treated as a read+write on the relevant; memory location (and alias analysis will take advantage of that). In addition,; it is legal to reorder non-atomic and Unordered loads around Monotonic; loads.

By doing this, the intermediate files used for ; the analysis are kept on the disk in `./ctu-dir`.; ; # Collect and store the data required by the CTU analysis; $ analyze-build --ctu-collect-only; ; # Analyze using the previously collected data; $ analyze-build --ctu-analyze-only. Use `--help` to get more information about the commands. Limitations; -----------. Generally speaking, the `intercept-build` and `analyze-build` tools together; does the same job as `scan-build` does. So, you can expect the same output; from this line as simple `scan-build` would do:. $ intercept-build <your build command> && analyze-build. The major difference is how and when the analyzer is run. The `scan-build`; tool has three distinct model to run the analyzer:. 1. Use compiler wrappers to make actions.; The compiler wrappers does run the real compiler and the analyzer.; This is the default behaviour, can be enforced with `--override-compiler`; flag. 2. Use special library to intercept compiler calls during the build process.; The analyzer run against each modules after the build finished.; Use `--intercept-first` flag to get this model. 3. Use compiler wrappers to intercept compiler calls during the build process.; The analyzer run against each modules after the build finished.; Use `--intercept-first` and `--override-compiler` flags together to get; this model. The 1. and 3. are using compiler wrappers, which works only if the build; process respects the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables. (Some build; process can override these variable as command line parameter only. This case; you need to pass the compiler wrappers manually. eg.: `intercept-build; --override-compiler make CC=intercept-cc CXX=intercept-c++ all` where the; original build command would have been `make all` only.).

The result of an instruction alias can also use immediates; and fixed physical registers which are added as simple immediate operands in the; result, for example:. ::. // Fixed Immediate operand.; def : InstAlias<""aad"", (AAD8i8 10)>;. // Fixed register operand.; def : InstAlias<""fcomi"", (COM_FIr ST1)>;. // Simple alias.; def : InstAlias<""fcomi $reg"", (COM_FIr RST:$reg)>;. Instruction aliases can also have a Requires clause to make them subtarget; specific. If the back-end supports it, the instruction printer can automatically emit the; alias rather than what's being aliased. It typically leads to better, more; readable code. If it's better to print out what's being aliased, then pass a '0'; as the third parameter to the InstAlias definition. Instruction Matching; --------------------. .. note::.

It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant. Several notes on semantic analysis before we get into construction; of the AST:. * Your expression probably involves some types and some subexpressions.; Make sure to fully check that those types, and the types of those; subexpressions, meet your expectations. Add implicit conversions where; necessary to make sure that all of the types line up exactly the way you; want them. Write extensive tests to check that you're getting good; diagnostics for mistakes and that you can use various forms of; subexpressions with your expression.; * When type-checking a type or subexpression, make sure to first check; whether the type is ""dependent"" (``Type::isDependentType()``) or whether a; subexpression is type-dependent (``Expr::isTypeDependent()``). If any of; these return ``true``, then you're inside a template and you can't do much; type-checking now. That's normal, and your AST node (when you get there); will have to deal with this case. At this point, you can write tests that; use your expression within templates, but don't try to instantiate the; templates.; * For each subexpression, be sure to call ``Sema::CheckPlaceholderExpr()``; to deal with ""weird"" expressions that don't behave well as subexpressions.; Then, determine whether you need to perform lvalue-to-rvalue conversions; (``Sema::DefaultLvalueConversions``) or the usual unary conversions; (``Sema::UsualUnaryConversions``), for places where the subexpression is; producing a value you intend to use.; * Your ``BuildXXX`` function will probably just return ``ExprError()`` at; this point, since you don't have an AST.

In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load.

If no such file is present ROOT falls back to the; standard information flow. ### Observable differences from 'standard' ROOT. As always, ROOT is (mostly) API and ABI compatible. C++ Modules-aware ROOT is no; different. There are several differences which can be noticed:; * \*modulemap files in $ROOTSYS/include -- those files are used by rootcling to; put a set of header files in a single pcm file. For example, all related; headers of *libGeom* are persisted in *Geom.pcm*. There are a few notable; examples, which are specific to the way we build ROOT. In certain cases we; want some header files to be compiled within C context or with RTTI on/off.; That's mostly for bootstrapping ROOT (aka rootcling stage1).; * modulemap.overlay.yaml -- automatically created virtual filesystem overlay; file. This file introduces C++ Modules for external dependencies.; For example, to 'modularize' glibc for ROOT we would need to place a modulemap; file in (usually) `/usr/include`. This folder is not writable on many; platforms. The vfs file tells the compiler to pretend there is a file at a; specific location. This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback.

Integrability,"s data to the program to execute an attack; (privilege escalation, command injection, SQL injection etc.). The malicious data is injected at the taint source (e.g. ``getenv()`` call); which is then propagated through function calls and being used as arguments of; sensitive operations, also called as taint sinks (e.g. ``system()`` call). One can defend against this type of vulnerability by always checking and; sanitizing the potentially malicious, untrusted user input. The goal of the checker is to discover and show to the user these potential; taint source-sink pairs and the propagation call chain. The most notable examples of taint sources are:. - data from network; - files or standard input; - environment variables; - data from databases. Let us examine a practical example of a Command Injection attack. .. code-block:: c. // Command Injection Vulnerability Example; int main(int argc, char** argv) {; char cmd[2048] = ""/bin/cat "";; char filename[1024];; printf(""Filename:"");; scanf ("" %1023[^\n]"", filename); // The attacker can inject a shell escape here; strcat(cmd, filename);; system(cmd); // Warning: Untrusted data is passed to a system call; }.

Integrability,"s from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:35551,depend,dependent,35551,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['depend'],['dependent']
Integrability,"s in a given; declaration context. For instance, unnamed declarations (anonymous structs),; non-first ``friend`` declarations and template specializations are hidden. This; is a problem, because if we use the regular C/C++ lookup then we create; redundant AST nodes during the merge! Also, having two instances of the same; node could result in false :ref:`structural in-equivalencies <structural-eq>`; of other nodes which depend on the duplicated node. Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:106454,interface,interface,106454,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

In above example, ``runOnFunction`` for ``DominatorTree`` is called by pass; manager before returning a reference to the desired pass. If your pass is capable of updating analyses if they exist (e.g.,; ``BreakCriticalEdges``, as described above), you can use the; ``getAnalysisIfAvailable`` method, which returns a pointer to the analysis if; it is active. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. if (DominatorSet *DS = getAnalysisIfAvailable<DominatorSet>()) {; // A DominatorSet is active. This code will update it.; }. Implementing Analysis Groups; ----------------------------. Now that we understand the basics of how passes are defined, how they are used,; and how they are required from other passes, it's time to get a little bit; fancier. All of the pass relationships that we have seen so far are very; simple: one pass depends on one other specific pass to be run before it can; run. For many applications, this is great, for others, more flexibility is; required. In particular, some analyses are defined such that there is a single simple; interface to the analysis results, but multiple ways of calculating them.; Consider alias analysis for example. The most trivial alias analysis returns; ""may alias"" for any alias query. The most sophisticated analysis a; flow-sensitive, context-sensitive interprocedural analysis that can take a; significant amount of time to execute (and obviously, there is a lot of room; between these two extremes for other implementations).

Integrability,"s information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction. When to specify alignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #. Prefer globals over inttoptr of a constant address - this gives you; dereferencability information. In MCJIT, use getSymbolAddress to provide; actual address. #.

Typedef Preservation and Selective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~.

The direction \f$\vec{n}\f$ must be a unit vector having as; components the director cosines. The full classification of a given; state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node; containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary; along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the; current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest; boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a; detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical; constraints.

This allows either developing a tracker for; simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an; external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface; for external trackers can be found in `$ROOTSYS/vmc` folder and it can; be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (\*) by using; directly a geometry described with %ROOT. The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into; TGeoManager class and implemented in the navigator class; TGeoNavigator.

Integrability,"s possible to implement this interface in many different ways. For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments.

When creating the wrapper, the parameter values stored in **`TF1`** will be copied in the `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` object.; The function object representing the model function is given to the `ROOT::Fitter` class using the `Fitter::SetFunction` method. The user has also the possibility to provide a function object, which implements the derivatives of the function with respect; to the parameters.; This information might be useful for some types of fits. In this case he needs to provide the function object as a class deriving from the; `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim` interface.; Note that the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` implements also the gradient interface, using internally `TF1::GradientPar`,; which",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:36714,wrap,wrapper,36714,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

The libraries are designed and organized to minimize dependencies,; such that you can load just enough code for the task at hand rather; than having to load all libraries or one monolithic chunk. The core; library (`libCore.so`) contains the essentials; it is a part of all; ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made; up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes,; operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for; compression of the ROOT files. The Cling library (`libCling.so`) is also needed in all ROOT; applications, and even by `libCore`. A; program referencing only **`TObject`** only needs `libCore`;; `libCling` will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write; ROOT objects one also has to load `libRIO`. As one would expect, none of that; depends on graphics or the GUI.

Integrability,"s the most basic function. Provides a method to evaluate the function given a value (simple double) by implementing; `double operator() (const double )`. The user class defined only needs to reimplement the pure abstract method `double DoEval(double x)`,; that will do the work of evaluating the function at point x. Example on how to create a class that represents a mathematical function. The user only has to override two methods from `IBaseFunctionOneDim`:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim; {; double DoEval(double x) const; {; return x*x;; }. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim* Clone() const; {; return new MyFunction();; }; };; ```. * `ROOT::Math::IGradientFunctionOneDim`: Some of the numerical algorithm will need to calculate the derivatives of the function. In these cases, the user will have to provide the necessary code for; this to happen. The interface defined in `IGradientFunctionOneDim` introduced the method `double Derivative(double x)` that will return the derivative of the function at the point `x`. The class; inherit by the user will have to implement the abstract method `double DoDerivative(double x)`, leaving the rest of the class untouched. Example for implementing a gradient one-dimensional function:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyGradientFunction: public ROOT::Math::IGradientFunctionOneDim; {; public:; double DoEval(double x) const; {; return sin(x);; }. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim* Clone() const; {; return new MyGradientFunction();; }. double DoDerivative(double x) const; {; return -cos(x);; }. };; ```. ### Multi-dimensional Function Interfaces.

For example, if; you add hash tables to the language, it would probably make sense to; add the routines to a runtime, instead of inlining them all the way.; - **memory management** - Currently we can only access the stack in; Kaleidoscope. It would also be useful to be able to allocate heap; memory, either with calls to the standard libc malloc/free interface; or with a garbage collector. If you would like to use garbage; collection, note that LLVM fully supports `Accurate Garbage; Collection <../../GarbageCollection.html>`_ including algorithms that; move objects and need to scan/update the stack.; - **exception handling support** - LLVM supports generation of `zero; cost exceptions <../../ExceptionHandling.html>`_ which interoperate with; code compiled in other languages.

For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors.

These are used to crawl the heap for object references. In general, LLVM's support for GC does not include features which can be; adequately addressed with other features of the IR and does not specify a; particular binary interface. On the plus side, this means that you should be; able to integrate LLVM with an existing runtime. On the other hand, it can; have the effect of leaving a lot of work for the developer of a novel; language. We try to mitigate this by providing built in collector strategy; descriptions that can work with many common collector designs and easy; extension points.

Integrability,"s, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to know about) in your generated IR, so that LLVM can encode them into; your final stack maps. Depending on the collector strategy chosen, this is; accomplished by using either the ``@llvm.gcroot`` intrinsics or an; ``gc.statepoint`` relocation sequence.

Microsoft extensions; --------------------. clang has support for many extensions from Microsoft Visual C++. To enable these; extensions, use the ``-fms-extensions`` command-line option. This is the default; for Windows targets. Clang does not implement every pragma or declspec provided; by MSVC, but the popular ones, such as ``__declspec(dllexport)`` and ``#pragma; comment(lib)`` are well supported. clang has a ``-fms-compatibility`` flag that makes clang accept enough; invalid C++ to be able to parse most Microsoft headers. For example, it; allows `unqualified lookup of dependent base class members; <https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup_bases>`_, which is; a common compatibility issue with clang. This flag is enabled by default; for Windows targets. ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` lets clang delay parsing of function template; definitions until the end of a translation unit. This flag is enabled by; default for Windows targets. For compatibility with existing code that compiles with MSVC, clang defines the; ``_MSC_VER`` and ``_MSC_FULL_VER`` macros. When on Windows, these default to; either the same value as the currently installed version of cl.exe, or ``1933``; and ``193300000`` (respectively). The ``-fms-compatibility-version=`` flag; overrides these values. It accepts a dotted version tuple, such as 19.00.23506.; Changing the MSVC compatibility version makes clang behave more like that; version of MSVC.

Integrability,"s. Every element; we touched on has more available constructors: range selectors, stencils, edits; and rules. In this section, we'll briefly review each in turn, with references; to the source headers for up-to-date information. First, though, we clarify what; rewrite rules are actually rewriting. Rewriting ASTs to... Text?; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The astute reader may have noticed that we've been somewhat vague in our; explanation of what the rewrite rules are actually rewriting. We've referred to; ""code"", but code can be represented both as raw source text and as an abstract; syntax tree. So, which one is it?. Ideally, we'd be rewriting the input AST to a new AST, but clang's AST is not; terribly amenable to this kind of transformation. So, we compromise: we express; our patterns and the names that they bind in terms of the AST, but our changes; in terms of source code text. We've designed Transformer's language to bridge; the gap between the two representations, in an attempt to minimize the user's; need to reason about source code locations and other, low-level syntactic; details. Range Selectors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Transformer provides a small API for describing source ranges: the; ``RangeSelector`` combinators. These ranges are most commonly used to specify the; source code affected by an edit and to extract source code in constructing new; text. Roughly, there are two kinds of range combinators: ones that select a source; range based on the AST, and others that combine existing ranges into new ranges.; For example, ``node`` selects the range of source spanned by a particular AST; node, as we've seen, while ``after`` selects the (empty) range located immediately; after its argument range. So, ``after(node(""id""))`` is the empty range immediately; following the AST node bound to ``id``. For the full collection of ``RangeSelector``\ s, see the header,; `clang/Tooling/Transformer/RangeSelector.h <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/include/clan",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst:9964,bridg,bridge,9964,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst,1,['bridg'],['bridge']

Explicit cast from nullable to nonnull:. .. code-block:: cpp. __nullable id foo;; id bar = foo;; takesNonNull((_nonnull) bar); // should not warn here (backward compatibility hack); anotherTakesNonNull(bar); // would be great to warn here, but not necessary(*). Because bar corresponds to the same symbol all the time it is not easy to implement the checker that way the cast only suppress the first call but not the second. For this reason in the first implementation after a contradictory cast happens, I will treat bar as nullable unspecified, this way all of the warnings will be suppressed. Treating the symbol as nullable unspecified also has an advantage that in case the takesNonNull function body is being inlined, the will be no warning, when the symbol is dereferenced. In case I have time after the initial version I might spend additional time to try to find a more sophisticated solution, in which we would produce the second warning (*). **2) nonnull**. * Dereferencing a nonnull, or sending message to it is ok.; * Converting nonnull to nullable is Ok.; * When there is an explicit cast from nonnull to nullable I will trust the cast (it is probable there for a reason, because this cast does not suppress any warnings or errors).; * But what should we do about null checks?:. .. code-block:: cpp. __nonnull id takesNonnull(__nonnull id x) {; if (x == nil) {; // Defensive backward compatible code:; ....; return nil; // Should the analyzer cover this piece of code? Should we require the cast (__nonnull)nil?; }; ....; }. There are these directions:. * We can either take the branch; this way the branch is analyzed; * Should we not warn about any nullability issues in that branch? Probably not, it is ok to break the nullability postconditions when the nullability preconditions are violated.; * We can assume that these pointers are not null and we lose coverage with the analyzer.

Clang uses the host header files; --------------------------------; On debian based systems it is possible to install multiarch support for; arm-linux-gnueabi and arm-linux-gnueabihf. In many cases clang can successfully; use this multiarch support when ``--gcc-toolchain=`` and ``--sysroot=`` are not supplied.; Unfortunately clang adds ``/usr/local/include`` before; ``/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf`` leading to errors when compiling the hosts; header files. The multiarch support is not sufficient to build the builtins you will need to; use a separate arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain. No target passed to clang; -------------------------; If clang is not given a target it will typically use the host target, this will; not understand the Arm assembly language files resulting in error messages such; as ``error: unknown directive .syntax unified``. You can check the clang invocation in the error message to see if there is no; ``--target`` or if it is set incorrectly. The cause is usually; ``CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS`` not containing ``--target`` or ``CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET`` not being present. Arm architecture not given; --------------------------; The ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` will default to arm architecture v4t which; cannot assemble the barrier instructions used in the synch_and_fetch source; files.

Pdf components dependent on these alone are added to the subsidiary likelihood. \note This overrides all other likelihood parameters (like those in the `ConstrainedParameters` argument) if present.; - Finally, a string argument `global_observables_tag` can be given, which should be set as attribute in any pdf component to indicate that it is a global observable. Can be used instead of or in addition to a `GlobalObservables` argument. Using these parameters, creating a likelihood of a simultaneous pdf (i.e. a `RooSimultaneous`) with constrained terms and global observables can be done with:. ``` {.cpp}; auto likelihood = RooFit::TestStatistics::buildLikelihood(; simultaneous_pdf, data,; RooFit::TestStatistics::ConstrainedParameters(RooArgSet(/*YOUR CONSTRAINED PARAMETERS*/)),; RooFit::TestStatistics::GlobalObservables(RooArgSet(/*YOUR GLOBAL OBSERVABLES*/)));; ```. The resulting object will be a `RooSumL` containing a `RooSubsidiaryL` with the constrained parameters and `RooBinnedL` or `RooUnbinnedL` components for each simultaneous pdf component (depending on whether they are binned or unbinned pdfs).; Note that, just like for `fitTo`, the order of the parameters is arbitrary.; The difference is that `fitTo` has a step to analyze the `RooCmdArg` optional parameters for their content dynamically at runtime, while in `buildLikelihood` the arguments are statically typed and so no further runtime analysis is needed.

When deciding between creating a type hierarchy (with either tagged or virtual; dispatch) and using templates or concepts-based polymorphism, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code.

We have tried to keep the interface to a minimal level by:. - Avoiding methods that provide the same functionality but use; different names (like `getX()` and `x()`). - Minimizing the number of setter methods, avoiding methods, which can; be ambiguous and can set the vector classes in an inconsistent; state. We provide only methods which set all the coordinates at the; same time or set only the coordinates on which the vector is based,; for example `SetX()` for a Cartesian vector. We then enforce the use; of transformations as rotations or translations (additions) for; modifying the vector contents. - The majority of the functionality, which is present in the CLHEP; package, involving operations on two vectors, is moved in separated; helper functions (see `ROOT::Math::VectorUtil`). This has the; advantage that the basic interface will remain more stable with time; while additional functions can be added easily. #### Naming Convention. As part of ROOT, the `GenVector` package adheres to the prescribed ROOT; naming convention, with some (approved) exceptions, as described here:. - Every class and function is in the **`ROOT::Math`** namespace. - Member function names start with upper-case letter, apart some; exceptions (see the next section about CLHEP compatibility). #### Compatibility with CLHEP Vector Classes. - For backward compatibility with CLHEP the vector classes can be; constructed from a CLHEP `HepVector` or **`HepLorentzVector`**, by; using a template constructor, which requires only that the classes; implement the accessors` x()`, `y()`, and `z()` (and `t()` for the; 4D). - We provide vector member function with the same naming convention as; CLHEP for the most used functions like `x()`, `y()` and `z()`. #### Connection to Linear Algebra Package.

At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor.

Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst:1747,integrat,integration,1747,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"same styles as they are automatically; formatted, and thus these guidelines may not be suitable. ``#include`` Style; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Immediately after the `header file comment`_ (and include guards if working on a; header file), the `minimal list of #includes`_ required by the file should be; listed. We prefer these ``#include``\s to be listed in this order:. .. _Main Module Header:; .. _Local/Private Headers:. #. Main Module Header; #. Local/Private Headers; #. LLVM project/subproject headers (``clang/...``, ``lldb/...``, ``llvm/...``, etc); #. System ``#include``\s. and each category should be sorted lexicographically by the full path. The `Main Module Header`_ file applies to ``.cpp`` files which implement an; interface defined by a ``.h`` file. This ``#include`` should always be included; **first** regardless of where it lives on the file system. By including a; header file first in the ``.cpp`` files that implement the interfaces, we ensure; that the header does not have any hidden dependencies which are not explicitly; ``#include``\d in the header, but should be. It is also a form of documentation; in the ``.cpp`` file to indicate where the interfaces it implements are defined. LLVM project and subproject headers should be grouped from most specific to least; specific, for the same reasons described above. For example, LLDB depends on; both clang and LLVM, and clang depends on LLVM. So an LLDB source file should; include ``lldb`` headers first, followed by ``clang`` headers, followed by; ``llvm`` headers, to reduce the possibility (for example) of an LLDB header; accidentally picking up a missing include due to the previous inclusion of that; header in the main source file or some earlier header file. clang should; similarly include its own headers before including llvm headers.

Possible Questions; ==================. How modules speed up compilation; --------------------------------. A classic theory for the reason why modules speed up the compilation is:; if there are ``n`` headers and ``m`` source files and each header is included by each source file,; then the complexity of the compilation is ``O(n*m)``;; But if there are ``n`` module interfaces and ``m`` source files, the complexity of the compilation is; ``O(n+m)``. So, using modules would be a big win when scaling.; In a simpler word, we could get rid of many redundant compilations by using modules. Roughly, this theory is correct. But the problem is that it is too rough.; The behavior depends on the optimization level, as we will illustrate below. First is ``O0``. The compilation process is described in the following graph. .. code-block:: none. ├-------------frontend----------┼-------------middle end----------------┼----backend----┤; │ │ │ │; └---parsing----sema----codegen--┴----- transformations ---- codegen ----┴---- codegen --┘. ┌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; | │; | source file │; | │; └---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┘. ┌--------┐; │ │; │imported│; │ │; │ co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:39893,interface,interfaces,39893,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters. A new tutorial macro rf903_numintcache.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of this feature. Representation of function and p.d.f. derivatives; A new class has been added that can represent the derivative of any p.d.f or function w.r.t. any; parameter or observable. To construct e.g. a first order derivative of a Gaussian p.d.f, do. RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ;. A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro rf111_derivatives.C. Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface. Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X.

By default first derivatives are calculated numerically by M . In case; the user wants to supply their own gradient calculator (e.g. analytical; derivatives), they need to implement the FCNGradientBase interface. ![](figures/fcngradientbase.png).

Interaction with the parameters of the function are essential both for M; and the user. Different interfaces are provided, depending on the level; of interaction. ### Minimal required interface ###. Starting values of parameters and uncertainties can be provided to M by; the user via std::vector$<$double$>$ vector containers. Any interaction; with the parameters before minimization (fix, release, limits, etc.) is; not possible then.

Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold.

A) If a positioned volume contains points that are not also contained; by its mother, we will call the corresponding region as an `extrusion`.; When navigating from outside to inside (trying to enter such a node); these regions are invisible since the current track has not yet reached; its mother.

B) We will call ***`overlaps`*** only the regions in space contained by; more than one node inside the same container. The owner of such regions; cannot be determined based on hierarchical considerations; therefore; they will be considered as belonging to the node from which the current; track is coming from. When coming from their container, the ownership is totally; unpredictable. Again, the ownership of overlapping regions highly; depends on the current track parameters.

In certain cases we; want some header files to be compiled within C context or with RTTI on/off.; That's mostly for bootstrapping ROOT (aka rootcling stage1).; * modulemap.overlay.yaml -- automatically created virtual filesystem overlay; file. This file introduces C++ Modules for external dependencies.; For example, to 'modularize' glibc for ROOT we would need to place a modulemap; file in (usually) `/usr/include`.

This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct.

Utility and Applications. Library Based Architecture. A major design concept for clang is its use of a library-based; architecture. In this design, various parts of the front-end can be cleanly; divided into separate libraries which can then be mixed up for different needs; and uses. In addition, the library-based approach encourages good interfaces; and makes it easier for new developers to get involved (because they only need; to understand small pieces of the big picture). ""The world needs better compiler tools, tools which are built as libraries.; This design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways. However,; building the tools as libraries isn't enough: they must have clean APIs, be as; decoupled from each other as possible, and be easy to modify/extend. This; requires clean layering, decent design, and keeping the libraries independent of; any specific client."". Currently, clang is divided into the following libraries and tool:. libsupport - Basic support library, from LLVM.; libsystem - System abstraction library, from LLVM.; libbasic - Diagnostics, SourceLocations, SourceBuffer abstraction,; file system caching for input source files.; libast - Provides classes to represent the C AST, the C type system,; builtin functions, and various helpers for analyzing and manipulating the; AST (visitors, pretty printers, etc).; liblex - Lexing and pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:4138,interface,interfaces,4138,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Note that a `ROOT::Fit::ParameterSettings` objects exists for each fit parameter and it created by the `ROOT::Fit::FitConfig` class, after the model function has been set in the Fitter.; Only when the function is set, the number of parameter is known and; automatically the `FitConfig` creates the corresponding `ParameterSetting` objects. When fitting, different minimizer can be used. The can be implemented in different libraries and loaded ar run time by the plug-in manager system of ROOT.; Each different minimizer (e.g. *Minuit, Minuit2, Fumili,* etc.) consists of a different implementation of the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface.; Within the same minimizer, thus within the same class implementing the `Minimizer` interface, different algorithms can exist.; For example in the case of Minuit, we have *Migrad, Simplex* or *Minimize*. The minimizer and its corresponding algorithm, when available,; can be set by using the function `FitConfig::SetMinimizer(""minimizerName"")` or by using directly the `ROOT:Math::MinimizerOptions` class. If the requested minimizer is not available in ROOT, the default one is used. The default minimizer type and algorithm can be specified by using the; static function `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""minimizerName"")`. ### Minimizer Libraries and Algorithms.

Integrability,"skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently.

Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used.

A mutex is a mutually; exclusive lock. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** class and its descendant classes (e.g.; **`TPosixMutex`**). **`TCondition`** class implements a condition variable. Use a condition; variable to signal threads.

Use a semaphore; to synchronize threads. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** and **`TConditionImp`** classes. ### TThread for Pedestrians.

This loads the library with the **`TThread`** class and the `pthread`; specific implementation file for `Posix` threads. 2. Coding.

To facilitate this and; avoid some insanely deep nesting on occasion, don't indent namespaces. If it; helps readability, feel free to add a comment indicating what namespace is; being closed by a ``}``. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm. Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:.

The aim of these classes is to extend and improve the fitting functionality provided in ROOT via the TVirtualFitter classes and the fitting methods present in many data analysis object, such as TH1::Fit.; ; The fit data are decoupled from the fitter class and described by the dedicated fit data classes like the ROOT::Fit::BinData for bin data containing coordinate values of any dimensions, bin content values and optionally errors in coordinate and bin content, and ROOT::Fit::UnBinData classes for any dimension un-bin data.; The fitter class, ROOT::Fit::Fitter, provides the functionality for fitting those data with any model function implementing the parametric function interface, ROOT::Math::IParamMultiFunction. Fit methods such as least square, bin and un-bin likelihood are supported. The fit solution is then found by using the ROOT::Math::Minimizer interface class and the results are stored in the ROOT::Fit::FitResult class. Fit parameter can be configured individually using the ROOT::Fit::FitParameterSettings class.; ; Various implementation of the minimizer interface can be used automatically using the ROOT plug-in manager mechanism, including the linear fitter for a fast and direct solution, in case of a linear least square model, or by using Minuit, Minuit2 or GSL minimization methods provided by the MathMore library. Functions for filling the new ROOT::Fit::BinData classes with all the histogram and graph types have been added in the histogram library (libHist) and graph library:; ; ROOT::Fit::FillData( BinData & , const TH1 *, TF1 * ) for histograms (in libHist); ROOT::Fit::FillData( BinData & , const TGraph2D *, TF1 * ) for 2D graphs (in libHist); ROOT::Fit::FillData( BinData & , const TGraph *, TF1 * ) for all 1D graphs (in libGraf); ROOT::Fit::FillData( BinData & , const TMultiGraph *, TF1 * ) for multi-graphs (in libGraf); .",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/doc/v520/index.html:4955,interface,interface,4955,math/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/doc/v520/index.html,1,['interface'],['interface']

Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple.

This scheme, where all the; work to make a Module executable is done up front, is simple to understand and; its performance characteristics are easy to reason about. However, it will lead; to very high startup times if the amount of code to be compiled is large, and; may also do a lot of unnecessary compilation if only a few compiled functions; are ever called at runtime.

In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address.

In `RooFit::TestStatistics`, we separated this functionality out into the `ConstantTermsOptimizer` class.; In fact, it is not so much a class, as it is a collection of static functions that can be applied to any combination of pdf and dataset.; This class does essentially the same as `constOptimizeTestStatistic` did on a `RooNLLVar`, except that it has been factored out into a separate class. ### Usage example: apply constant term optimization on pdf and dataset inside a likelihood; Applying the default `ConstantTermsOptimizer` optimization routines on the pdf and dataset inside a `RooAbsL` likelihood is as simple as:. ``` {.cpp}; likelihood.constOptimizeTestStatistic();; ```; This applies constant term optimization to the cloned pdf and dataset inside the likelihood object.; It will not modify anything outside of the likelihood. Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```. For the adventurous user, it is also possible to apply constant term optimization to a pdf and dataset directly without needing a likelihood object, e.g. given some `RooArgSet` set of observables `normSet`:; ``` {.cpp}; bool applyTrackingOpt = true;; ConstantTermsOptimizer::enableConstantTermsOptimization(&pdf, &normSet, dataset, applyTrackingOpt);; ```; We refer to RooFit documentation for more about ""tracking optimization"" which can be enabled",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:10432,rout,routines,10432,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,1,['rout'],['routines']

So this file could be triggered like a module unit or a non-module unit depending on the definition; of some macros.; However, this kind of usage is forbidden by P1857R3 but we haven't implemented P1857R3 yet.; This means that is possible to write illegal modules code now, and obviously this will stop working; once P1857R3 is implemented.; A simple suggestion would be ""Don't play macro tricks with module declarations"".

DenseMap's find_as() method supports lookup operations using an alternate key; type. This is useful in cases where the normal key type is expensive to; construct, but cheap to compare against. The DenseMapInfo is responsible for; defining the appropriate comparison and hashing methods for each alternate key; type used.

Clang must ensure that the above attributes are added both to the; function's declaration/definition as well as to their call-sites. This is; important for calls to attributed function pointers, where there is no; definition or declaration available. 2. Handling PSTATE.SM; =====================. When changing PSTATE.SM the execution of FP/vector operations may be transferred; to another processing element. This has three important implications:. * The runtime SVE vector length may change. * The contents of FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers are zeroed. * The set of allowable instructions changes. This leads to certain restrictions on IR and optimizations. For example, it; is undefined behaviour to share vector-length dependent state between functions; that may operate with different values for PSTATE.SM. Front-ends must honour; these restrictions when generating LLVM IR. Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not. If we let the compiler insert the appropriate ``smstart``; and ``smstop`` instructions around call boundaries, then the effects on SVE; state can be mitigated. By limiting the state changes to a very brief window; around the call we can control how the operations are scheduled and how live; values remain preserved between state transitions. In order to control PSTATE.SM at this level of granularity, we use function and; callsite attributes rather than intrinsics.

On a practical note, it's often said that an automatic binder can provide; bindings to 95% of your code out-of-the-box, with only the remaining part; needing manual intervention.; This is broadly true, but realize that that 5% contains the most difficult; cases and is where 20-30% of the effort would have gone in case the bindings; were done fully manually.; It is therefore important to consider what manual tools an automatic binder; offers and to make sure they fit your work style and needs, because you are; going to spend a significant amount of time with them. `LLVM dependency`; -----------------. cppyy depends on `LLVM`_, through Cling.; LLVM is properly internalized, so that it doesn't conflict with other uses;; and in particular it is fine to mix `Numba`_ and cppyy code.; It does mean a download cost of about 20MB for the binary wheel (exact size; differs per platform) on installation, and additional `primarily initial`; memory overheads at run-time.; Whether this is onerous depends strongly not only on the application, but; also on the rest of the software stack. The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings.

We define a *happens-before* partial order as the least partial order; that. - Is a superset of single-thread program order, and; - When ``a`` *synchronizes-with* ``b``, includes an edge from ``a`` to; ``b``. *Synchronizes-with* pairs are introduced by platform-specific; techniques, like pthread locks, thread creation, thread joining,; etc., and by atomic instructions.

Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format).

Integrability,"submodules of this package expose their own `RDataFrame` objects. The only needed change in user code is to substitute `ROOT.RDataFrame` calls with such backend-specific `RDataFrame`s. For example:. ```python; import ROOT. # Point RDataFrame calls to the Spark specific RDataFrame; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Spark.RDataFrame. # It still accepts the same constructor arguments as traditional RDataFrame; df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root""). # Continue the application with the traditional RDataFrame API; ```. The main goal of this package is to support running any RDataFrame application distributedly. Nonetheless, not all RDataFrame operations currently work with this package. The subset that is currently available is:. - AsNumpy; - Count; - Define; - Fill; - Filter; - Graph; - Histo[1,2,3]D; - Max; - Mean; - Min; - Profile[1,2,3]D; - Snapshot; - Sum. with support for more operations coming in the future. Any distributed RDataFrame backend inherits the dependencies of the underlying software needed to distribute the applications. The Spark backend for example has the following runtime dependencies (ROOT will build just fine without, but the feature will be unavailable without these packages):. - [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html), that in turn has its own set of dependencies:; - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/); - [py4j](https://www.py4j.org/).

Integrability,"such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`. The result will be `Bar` objects with data; member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is; to call `BypassStreamer(kFALSE)` for the **`TClonesArray`**. In this; case, the normal `Bar::Streamer` function will be called. The; `Bar::Streamer` function works OK independently if the `Bar`; `StreamerInfo `had been generated in optimized mode or not. ## Pointers and References in Persistency. An object pointer as a data member presents a challenge to the streaming; software. If the object pointed to is saved every time, it could create; circular dependencies and consume a large amount of disk space. The; network of references must be preserved on disk and recreated upon; reading the file. If you use independent I/O operations for pointers and their referenced; objects you can use the **`TRef`** class. Later in this section is an; example that compares disk space, memory usage, and I/O times of C++; pointers and **`TRef`**`s`. In general, a **`TRef`** is faster than C++; but the advantage of a C++ pointer is that it is already C++. ### Streaming C++ Pointers. When ROOT encounters a pointer data member it calls the `Streamer` of; the object and labels it with a unique object identifier. The object; identifier is unique for one I/O operation. If there is another pointer; to the object in the same I/O operation, the first object is referenced; i.e. it is not saved again. When reading the file, the object is rebuilt; and the references recalculated. ![Streaming object pointers](pictures/020000EC.jpg).

Code using; ``+forced-atomics`` is ABI-incompatible with code not using the feature, if; atomic variables cross the ABI boundary.

Integrability,"t --trees Events --all-branches --threads 8; ```. ## Core Libraries. ### Interpreter. #### Support for profiling/debugging interpreted/JITted code. This version of ROOT adds an LLVM JIT event listener to create perf map files; during runtime. This allows profiling of interpreted/JITted code generated by; cling. Instead of function addresses, the perf data will contain full function; names. In addition, stack frame pointers are enabled in JITted code, so full; stack traces can be generated. Debugging is aided by switching off optimisations; and adding frame pointers for better stack traces. However, since both have a; runtime cost, they are disabled by default. Similar to `LD_DEBUG` and `LD_PROFILE`; for `ld.so`, the environment variables `CLING_DEBUG=1` and/or `CLING_PROFILE=1`; can be set to enable debugging and/or profiling. ### Other changes. - Shadowing of declarations in the `std` namespace is now diagnosed. Specifically, given that ROOT injects `using namespace std` directive, _all_ the names in the `std` namespace become available in the global scope. However, in some circumstances users inadvertently introduce a declaration that conflicts with a name in `std` making references to the former declaration result in ambiguous lookup.; A fairly common case is trying to declare a global variable named `data` which conflict with [`std::data`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/data) [C++17]. See [ROOT-5971](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-5971) for a discussion.; As of v6.28, such declarations result in; ```; root [] int data;; ROOT_prompt_0:1:1: warning: 'data' shadows a declaration with the same name in the 'std' namespace; use '::data' to reference this declaration; int data;; ^; ```. - Line editing at the ROOT interactive prompt has been improved. This version introduces useful shortcuts for common actions, e.g. Xterm-like fast movement between words using Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+Del to delete the word under the cursor, or clearing the s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md:6414,inject,injects,6414,README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,1,['inject'],['injects']

It can be constructed in three different ways:; * Any object implementing both `double operator()( double)` for the function evaluation and `double Derivative(double)` for the function derivative.; * Any object implementing any member function like `Foo::XXX(double )` for the function evaluation and any other member function like `Foo::YYY(double )` for the derivative.; * Any two function objects implementing `double operator()( double )` . One object provides the function evaluation, the other the derivative. One or both function object can be a free C function of; type `double ()(double )`. #### Wrapping Multi-dimensional Functions. The class `ROOT::Math::Functor` is used to wrap in a very simple and convenient way multi-dimensional function objects. It can wrap all the following types:; * Any C++ callable object implementing `double operator()( const double * )`.; * A free C function of type `double ()(const double * )`.; * A member function with the correct signature like `Foo::Eval(const double * )`. In this case one pass the object pointer and a pointer to the member function `(&Foo::Eval)`. The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. Example of using `Functor`:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/Functor.h"". class MyFunction {. public:; double operator()(const double *x) const {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. double Eval(const double * x) const { return x[0]+x[1]; }; };. double freeFunction(const double * x ); {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. int main(); {; // test directly calling the function object; MyFunction myf;. // test from a free function pointer; ROOT::Math::Functor f1(&freeFunction,2);. // test from function object; ROOT::Math::Functor f2(myf,2);. // test from a member function; ROOT::Math::Functor f3(&myf,&MyFunction::Eval,2);. double x[] = {1,2};. cout << f1(x) << endl;; c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:44942,wrap,wrap,44942,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['wrap'],['wrap']
Integrability,"t ``dealloc`` is really far too late; for the object to be raising such objections. Somewhat more legitimately, an; object may have been pool-allocated and should not be deallocated with; ``free``; for now, this can only be supported with a ``dealloc``; implementation outside of ARC. Such an implementation must be very careful; to do all the other work that ``NSObject``'s ``dealloc`` would, which is; outside the scope of this document to describe. The instance variables for an ARC-compiled class will be destroyed at some; point after control enters the ``dealloc`` method for the root class of the; class. The ordering of the destruction of instance variables is unspecified,; both within a single class and between subclasses and superclasses. .. admonition:: Rationale. The traditional, non-ARC pattern for destroying instance variables is to; destroy them immediately before calling ``[super dealloc]``. Unfortunately,; message sends from the superclass are quite capable of reaching methods in; the subclass, and those methods may well read or write to those instance; variables. Making such message sends from dealloc is generally discouraged,; since the subclass may well rely on other invariants that were broken during; ``dealloc``, but it's not so inescapably dangerous that we felt comfortable; calling it undefined behavior. Therefore we chose to delay destroying the; instance variables to a point at which message sends are clearly disallowed:; the point at which the root class's deallocation routines take over. In most code, the difference is not observable. It can, however, be observed; if an instance variable holds a strong reference to an object whose; deallocation will trigger a side-effect which must be carefully ordered with; respect to the destruction of the super class. Such code violates the design; principle that semantically important behavior should be explicit. A simple; fix is to clear the instance variable manually during ``dealloc``; a more; holistic solu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:89199,message,message,89199,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['message'],['message']

((SomeA.X + 40) + SomeA) / 42 + SomeA.X : SomeA.X);; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~. Here you can see that you don't even need to see the original source code to; understand what is wrong based on the Clang error: Because Clang prints a; caret, you know exactly which plus it is complaining about. The range; information highlights the left and right side of the plus which makes it; immediately obvious what the compiler is talking about, which is very useful for; cases involving precedence issues and many other situations.; Clang diagnostics are very polished and have many features. For more; information and examples, please see the Expressive; Diagnostics page. GCC Compatibility. GCC is currently the defacto-standard open source compiler today, and it; routinely compiles a huge volume of code. GCC supports a huge number of; extensions and features (many of which are undocumented) and a lot of; code and header files depend on these features in order to build.; While it would be nice to be able to ignore these extensions and focus on; implementing the language standards to the letter, pragmatics force us to; support the GCC extensions that see the most use. Many users just want their; code to compile, they don't care to argue about whether it is pedantically C99; or not.; As mentioned above, all; extensions are explicitly recognized as such and marked with extension; diagnostics, which can be mapped to warnings, errors, or just ignored.

[FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2.

Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:18364,message,message,18364,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['message'],['message']

The read in an atomic; read-modify-write operation (:ref:`cmpxchg <i_cmpxchg>` and; :ref:`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>`) reads the value in the modification; order immediately before the value it writes. If one atomic read; happens before another atomic read of the same address, the later; read must see the same value or a later value in the address's; modification order. This disallows reordering of ``monotonic`` (or; stronger) operations on the same address. If an address is written; ``monotonic``-ally by one thread, and other threads ``monotonic``-ally; read that address repeatedly, the other threads must eventually see; the write. This corresponds to the C/C++ ``memory_order_relaxed``.; ``acquire``; In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, a; *synchronizes-with* edge may be formed with a ``release`` operation.; This is intended to model C/C++'s ``memory_order_acquire``.; ``release``; In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, if this operation; writes a value which is subsequently read by an ``acquire``; operation, it *synchronizes-with* that operation.

Example:; `successors: %bb.1(0x40000000), %bb.2(0x40000000)` can be replaced with; `successors: %bb.1, %bb.2`. - MIR code contains a whole IR module. This is necessary because there are; no equivalents in MIR for global variables, references to external functions,; function attributes, metadata, debug info. Instead some MIR data references; the IR constructs. You can often remove them if the test doesn't depend on; them. - Alias Analysis is performed on IR values. These are referenced by memory; operands in MIR. Example: `:: (load 8 from %ir.foobar, !alias.scope !9)`.; If the test doesn't depend on (good) alias analysis the references can be; dropped: `:: (load 8)`. - MIR blocks can reference IR blocks for debug printing, profile information; or debug locations. Example: `bb.42.myblock` in MIR references the IR block; `myblock`. It is usually possible to drop the `.myblock` reference and simply; use `bb.42`. - If there are no memory operands or blocks referencing the IR then the; IR function can be replaced by a parameterless dummy function like; `define @func() { ret void }`. - It is possible to drop the whole IR section of the MIR file if it only; contains dummy functions (see above).

Unless the ABI list contains; additional categories for those functions, a call to one of those functions; will produce a warning message, as the labelling behavior of the function; is unknown. The other supported categories are ``discard``, ``functional``; and ``custom``. * ``discard`` -- To the extent that this function writes to (user-accessible); memory, it also updates labels in shadow memory (this condition is trivially; satisfied for functions which do not write to user-accessible memory). Its; return value is unlabelled.; * ``functional`` -- Like ``discard``, except that the label of its return value; is the union of the label of its arguments.; * ``custom`` -- Instead of calling the function, a custom wrapper ``__dfsw_F``; is called, where ``F`` is the name of the function. This function may wrap; the original function or provide its own implementation. This category is; generally used for uninstrumentable functions which write to user-accessible; memory or which have more complex label propagation behavior. The signature; of ``__dfsw_F`` is based on that of ``F`` with each argument having a; label of type ``dfsan_label`` appended to the argument list.

Integrability,"t operates within the same; address space as other independent flows of controls within a process.; In most UNIX systems, thread and process characteristics are grouped; into a single entity called a process. Sometimes, threads are called; ""lightweight processes''. Note: This introduction is adapted from the AIX 4.3 Programmer's Manual. ## Threads and Processes. In traditional single-threaded process systems, a process has a set of; properties. In multi-threaded systems, these properties are divided; between processes and threads. ### Process Properties. A process in a multi-threaded system is the changeable entity. It must; be considered as an execution frame. It has all traditional process; attributes, such as:. - Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID. - Environment. - Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md:1053,message,message,1053,documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Threads.md,1,['message'],['message']

Taint analysis identifies potential security vulnerabilities where the; attacker can inject malicious data to the program to execute an attack; (privilege escalation, command injection, SQL injection etc.). The malicious data is injected at the taint source (e.g. ``getenv()`` call); which is then propagated through function calls and being used as arguments of; sensitive operations, also called as taint sinks (e.g. ``system()`` call). One can defend against this type of vulnerability by always checking and; sanitizing the potentially malicious, untrusted user input. The goal of the checker is to discover and show to the user these potential; taint source-sink pairs and the propagation call chain. The most notable examples of taint sources are:. - data from network; - files or standard input; - environment variables; - data from databases.

In this case variables are extracted onto the global scope.; ; TODO: There should be dedicated entry for that in the docs; Builtins; Cling starts with very few builtins loaded.

This method gives us an answer to a very curious question: whether we could; treat local values as equal, and which value is greater otherwise. It's; better to start from example:. Consider the situation when we're looking at the same place in left; function ""*FL*"" and in right function ""*FR*"". Every part of *left* place is; equal to the corresponding part of *right* place, and (!) both parts use; *Value* instances, for example:. .. code-block:: text. instr0 i32 %LV ; left side, function FL; instr0 i32 %RV ; right side, function FR. So, now our conclusion depends on *Value* instances comparison. The main purpose of this method is to determine relation between such values. What can we expect from equal functions? At the same place, in functions; ""*FL*"" and ""*FR*"" we expect to see *equal* values, or values *defined* at; the same place in ""*FL*"" and ""*FR*"". Consider a small example here:. .. code-block:: text. define void %f(i32 %pf0, i32 %pf1) {; instr0 i32 %pf0 instr1 i32 %pf1 instr2 i32 123; }. .. code-block:: text. define void %g(i32 %pg0, i32 %pg1) {; instr0 i32 %pg0 instr1 i32 %pg0 instr2 i32 123; }. In this example, *pf0* is associated with *pg0*, *pf1* is associated with; *pg1*, and we also declare that *pf0* < *pf1*, and thus *pg0* < *pf1*. Instructions with opcode ""*instr0*"" would be *equal*, since their types and; opcodes are equal, and values are *associated*.

In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or; there were wrong input arguments);. - -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used; anymore. ## Remotely Access to ROOT Files. ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running. Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a; **`TFile`** object using the static method **`TFile::Open()`** object.; This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of **`TFile`** to handle the; request. Inheriting from the **`TFile`** class, the returned instance will have; exactly the same interface and behavior of **`TFile`**.

Integrability,"t, then we have an ODR; violation in case of C++. If the ""from"" node is not a definition then we add; that to the redeclaration chain of the found node. This behaviour is essential; when we merge ASTs from different translation units which include the same; header file(s). For example, we want to have only one definition for the class; template ``std::vector``, even if we included ``<vector>`` in several; translation units. To find a structurally equivalent node we can use the regular C/C++ lookup; functions: ``DeclContext::noload_lookup()`` and; ``DeclContext::localUncachedLookup()``. These functions do respect the C/C++; name hiding rules, thus you cannot find certain declarations in a given; declaration context. For instance, unnamed declarations (anonymous structs),; non-first ``friend`` declarations and template specializations are hidden. This; is a problem, because if we use the regular C/C++ lookup then we create; redundant AST nodes during the merge! Also, having two instances of the same; node could result in false :ref:`structural in-equivalencies <structural-eq>`; of other nodes which depend on the duplicated node. Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class.

Getting Started; ===============. The -opt-bisect-limit command line option can be passed directly to tools such; as opt, llc and lli. The syntax is as follows:. ::. <tool name> [other options] -opt-bisect-limit=<limit>. If a value of -1 is used the tool will perform all optimizations but a message; will be printed to stderr for each optimization that could be skipped; indicating the index value that is associated with that optimization. To skip; optimizations, pass the value of the last optimization to be performed as the; opt-bisect-limit. All optimizations with a higher index value will be skipped. In order to use the -opt-bisect-limit option with a driver that provides a; wrapper around the LLVM core library, an additional prefix option may be; required, as defined by the driver. For example, to use this option with; clang, the ""-mllvm"" prefix must be used. A typical clang invocation would look; like this:. ::. clang -O2 -mllvm -opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.c. The -opt-bisect-limit option may also be applied to link-time optimizations by; using a prefix to indicate that this is a plug-in option for the linker. The; following syntax will set a bisect limit for LTO transformations:. ::. # When using lld, or ld64 (macOS); clang -flto -Wl,-mllvm,-opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.o my_other_file.o; # When using Gold; clang -flto -Wl,-plugin-opt,-opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.o my_other_file.o. LTO passes are run by a library instance invoked by the linker. Therefore any; passes run in the primary driver compilation phase are not affected by options; passed via '-Wl,-plugin-opt' and LTO passes are not affected by options; passed to the driver-invoked LLVM invocation via '-mllvm'.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst:2312,wrap,wrapper,2312,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

In order to allow the maximum amount of commonality to be; factored out, the LLVM code generator uses the; :doc:`TableGen/index` tool to describe big chunks of the; target machine, which allows the use of domain-specific and target-specific; abstractions to reduce the amount of repetition. As LLVM continues to be developed and refined, we plan to move more and more of; the target description to the ``.td`` form. Doing so gives us a number of; advantages. The most important is that it makes it easier to port LLVM because; it reduces the amount of C++ code that has to be written, and the surface area; of the code generator that needs to be understood before someone can get; something working. Second, it makes it easier to change things.

Target description classes; ==========================. The LLVM target description classes (located in the ``include/llvm/Target``; directory) provide an abstract description of the target machine independent of; any particular client. These classes are designed to capture the *abstract*; properties of the target (such as the instructions and registers it has), and do; not incorporate any particular pieces of code generation algorithms. All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented.

Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on GitHub).; * Inspect the repository history (blame, log, bisect) without Internet access.; * Maintain remote forks and branches on Git hosting services and; integrate back to the main repository. In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load.

The exact syntax for invoking the option is discussed below. This feature is not intended to replace other debugging tools such as bugpoint.; Rather it provides an alternate course of action when reproducing the problem; requires a complex build infrastructure that would make using bugpoint; impractical or when reproducing the failure requires a sequence of; transformations that is difficult to replicate with tools like opt and llc. Getting Started; ===============. The -opt-bisect-limit command line option can be passed directly to tools such; as opt, llc and lli. The syntax is as follows:. ::. <tool name> [other options] -opt-bisect-limit=<limit>. If a value of -1 is used the tool will perform all optimizations but a message; will be printed to stderr for each optimization that could be skipped; indicating the index value that is associated with that optimization. To skip; optimizations, pass the value of the last optimization to be performed as the; opt-bisect-limit. All optimizations with a higher index value will be skipped. In order to use the -opt-bisect-limit option with a driver that provides a; wrapper around the LLVM core library, an additional prefix option may be; required, as defined by the driver. For example, to use this option with; clang, the ""-mllvm"" prefix must be used. A typical clang invocation would look; like this:. ::. clang -O2 -mllvm -opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.c. The -opt-bisect-limit option may also be applied to link-time optimizations by; using a prefix to indicate that this is a plug-in option for the linker. The; following syntax will set a bisect limit for LTO transformations:. ::. # When using lld, or ld64 (macOS); clang -flto -Wl,-mllvm,-opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.o my_other_file.o; # When using Gol",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst:1919,message,message,1919,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,1,['message'],['message']

Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue.

For more information on how to; manage the actual release, please refer to :doc:`HowToReleaseLLVM`. Overview of the Release Process; -------------------------------. Once the release process starts, the Release Manager will ask for volunteers,; and it'll be the role of each volunteer to:. * Test and benchmark the previous release. * Test and benchmark each release candidate, comparing to the previous release; and candidates. * Identify, reduce and report every regression found during tests and benchmarks. * Make sure the critical bugs get fixed and merged to the next release candidate. Not all bugs or regressions are show-stoppers and it's a bit of a grey area what; should be fixed before the next candidate and what can wait until the next; release. It'll depend on:. * The severity of the bug, how many people it affects and if it's a regression; or a known bug. Known bugs are ""unsupported features"" and some bugs can be; disabled if they have been implemented recently. * The stage in the release. Less critical bugs should be considered to be; fixed between RC1 and RC2, but not so much at the end of it. * If it's a correctness or a performance regression.

Integrability,"te representation. It is not based on the; "":ref:`landingpad <i_landingpad>`"" instruction like the other two models, and is; described later in this document under :ref:`wineh`. Overview; --------. When an exception is thrown in LLVM code, the runtime does its best to find a; handler suited to processing the circumstance. The runtime first attempts to find an *exception frame* corresponding to the; function where the exception was thrown. If the programming language supports; exception handling (e.g. C++), the exception frame contains a reference to an; exception table describing how to process the exception. If the language does; not support exception handling (e.g. C), or if the exception needs to be; forwarded to a prior activation, the exception frame contains information about; how to unwind the current activation and restore the state of the prior; activation. This process is repeated until the exception is handled. If the; exception is not handled and no activations remain, then the application is; terminated with an appropriate error message. Because different programming languages have different behaviors when handling; exceptions, the exception handling ABI provides a mechanism for; supplying *personalities*. An exception handling personality is defined by; way of a *personality function* (e.g. ``__gxx_personality_v0`` in C++),; which receives the context of the exception, an *exception structure*; containing the exception object type and value, and a reference to the exception; table for the current function. The personality function for the current; compile unit is specified in a *common exception frame*. The organization of an exception table is language dependent. For C++, an; exception table is organized as a series of code ranges defining what to do if; an exception occurs in that range. Typically, the information associated with a; range defines which types of exception objects (using C++ *type info*) that are; handled in that range, and an associate",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:4371,message,message,4371,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['message'],['message']

That is the case,; when we are interested in the effects caused by different versions of; the same toolchain, or the impact of specific compiler optimizations. For those cases, we are looking to see which elements have been added; or removed.

Integrability,"tecture without that property is SPARC -- SPARCV8 SMP; systems were common, yet it doesn't support any sort of compare-and-swap; operation. Some targets (like RISCV) support a ``+forced-atomics`` target feature, which; enables the use of lock-free atomics even if LLVM is not aware of any specific; OS support for them. In this case, the user is responsible for ensuring that; necessary ``__sync_*`` implementations are available. Code using; ``+forced-atomics`` is ABI-incompatible with code not using the feature, if; atomic variables cross the ABI boundary. In either of these cases, the Target in LLVM can claim support for atomics of an; appropriate size, and then implement some subset of the operations via libcalls; to a ``__sync_*`` function. Such functions *must* not use locks in their; implementation, because unlike the ``__atomic_*`` routines used by; AtomicExpandPass, these may be mixed-and-matched with native instructions by the; target lowering. Further, these routines do not need to be shared, as they are stateless. So,; there is no issue with having multiple copies included in one binary. Thus,; typically these routines are implemented by the statically-linked compiler; runtime support library.

Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:8260,depend,depends,8260,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

Although the driver is part of and driven by the Clang project, it is; logically a separate tool which shares many of the same goals as Clang:. .. contents:: Features; :local:. GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possible.; - Don't parse arguments more than once.; - Provide a few simple interfaces for efficiently searching arguments.

Code generation is deferred until either the; MCJIT::finalizeObject method is called explicitly or a function such as; MCJIT::getPointerToFunction is called which requires the code to have been; generated. Code Generation; ===============. When code generation is triggered, as described above, MCJIT will first; attempt to retrieve an object image from its ObjectCache member, if one; has been set. If a cached object image cannot be retrieved, MCJIT will; call its emitObject method.

If an ObjectCache is being used, the; image will be passed to the ObjectCache here.

The advantages of std::set are that its iterators are stable (deleting or; inserting an element from the set does not affect iterators or pointers to other; elements) and that iteration over the set is guaranteed to be in sorted order.; If the elements in the set are large, then the relative overhead of the pointers; and malloc traffic is not a big deal, but if the elements of the set are small,; std::set is almost never a good choice. .. _dss_setvector:. llvm/ADT/SetVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

The difference between SetVector and other sets is that the order of iteration; is guaranteed to match the order of insertion into the SetVector. This property; is really important for things like sets of pointers. Because pointer values; are non-deterministic (e.g. vary across runs of the program on different; machines), iterating over the pointers in the set will not be in a well-defined; order.

For each point in the grid; the calculator finds the best fit value of the nuisance parameters (given the data). The construction; is then only performed in this subspace of the parameters. As a result, the number of points in the; construction only scales in the number of parameters of interest, not in the number of nuisance parameters.

The ``deleteValue`` method is called by transformations when they remove an; instruction or any other value from the program (including values that do not; use pointers).

Integrability,"th::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit"");; ```. Alternatively, you can add this line to your `~/.rootrc` file:; ```; Root.Fitter: Minuit; ```. ### Behavior change of `TMath::AreEqualAbs()`. The `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` compares two numbers for equality within a certain absolute range.; So far, it would tell you that `inf != inf` if you define `inf` as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`, which is inconsistent with the regular `==` operator. This is unexpected, because one would expect that if two numbers are considered exactly equal, they would also be considered equal within any range.; Therefore, the behavior of `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` was changed to return always `true` if the `==` comparison would return `true`. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Changes in RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf. The TFormula-based RooFit classes `RooFormulaVar` and `RooGenericPdf` change a bit their behavior to be more consistent:. 1. No matter which variables you pass to the constructor, only the variables that the formula depends on are registered as value servers.; 2. Similarly, the `dependents()` method of RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf will only return the list of actual value servers. ### Removal of the RooGenFunction and RooMultiGenFunction classes. The `RooGenFunction` was only a lightweight adaptor that exports a RooAbsReal as a `ROOT::Math::IGenFunction`.; The same can be easily achieved with the generic `ROOT::Math::Functor1D`, so in the spirit of not duplicating interfaces, the `RooGenFunction` is removed in this release. Here is an example that shows how to replace it in the unlikely case you were using it:. ```C++; RooArgSet normSet{x}; // normalization set. // Old way 1: create a RooGenFunction:; RooGenFunction func1{pdf, x, {}, normSet};. // Old way 2: use `RooAbsReal::iGenFunction()`:; std::unique_ptr<ROOT::Math::IGenFunction> func2{; pdf.iGenFunction(x, normSet); };. // How to do it now:; RooFunctor functor{pdf, x, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func3{funct",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md:11422,depend,depends,11422,README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

To do this, we use the exact same format as our; optimization level flags, but we also specify an option name.

This attribute can apply to strong local; variables, functions, methods, or blocks:. .. code-block:: objc. @class WobbleAmount;. @interface Widget : NSObject; -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount *)amount;; @end. @implementation Widget. -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount *)amount; __attribute__((objc_externally_retained)) {; // 'amount' and 'alias' aren't retained on entry, nor released on exit.; __attribute__((objc_externally_retained)) WobbleAmount *alias = amount;; }; @end. Annotating a function with this attribute makes every parameter with strong; retainable object pointer type externally-retained, unless the variable was; explicitly qualified with ``__strong``.

For model having operators not yet supported in the Keras parser it is then reccomended to convert the Keras model to `ONNX` using the python `tf2onnx` tool. #### SOFIE PyTorch Parser. If using PyTorch it is recommended to save the model directly in `ONNX` format instad of the native `.pt` format by using the `torch.onnx.export` function of PyTorch. The support for parsing directly `.pt` files is limited to the Gemm, Conv, Relu, Selu, Sigmoid and Transpose operators. #### SOFIE RDataFrame Integration.

M offers a procedure for finding $\mbox{FCN}$ $\mbox{CONTOURS}$; (provided via the class MnContours, see [api:contours]). The contour calculated by MnContours::operator() is dynamic, in the; sense that it represents the minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 2}$ parameters (if any). In statistical; terms, this means that MnContours takes account of the correlations; between the two parameters being plotted, and all the other variable; parameters, using a procedure analogous to that of $\mbox{MINOS}$.; (If this feature is not wanted, then the other parameters must be fixed; before calling $\mbox{CONTOURS}$.) MnContours provides the actual; coordinates of the points around the contour, suitable for plotting with; a graphics routine or by hand (using MnPlot, see [api:plot]). The points; are given in counter-clockwise order around the contour. Only one; contour is calculated per command, and the level is; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}} + \mbox{up}$. where $\mbox{up}$; is the return value of FCNBase::up() specified by the user (usually 1.0; by default).

To synchronize the actions of different threads you can use the; **`TCondition`** class, which provides a signaling mechanism.

An REntry can be passed to `RNTupleWriter::Fill()` and `RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`.; Otherwise, the reader/writer uses the default entry of its model. An entry can safely outlive its originating model.; New objects cannot anymore be created (`EmplaceNewValue` will throw an exception), but the entry is still properly destructed. ### RNTupleWriter, RNTupleParallelWriter; The RNTupleWriter is the primary interface to create an RNTuple.; The writer takes ownership of a given model.; The writer can either add an RNTuple to an existing ROOT file (`RNTupleWriter::Append()`) or create a new ROOT file with an RNTuple (`RNTupleWriter::Recreate()`).; Once created, entries are added to an RNTuple either serially (`RNTupleWriter::Fill()`) or in concurrently in multiple threads with the `RNTupleParallelWriter`.; Once committed (e.g. by releasing the RNTupleWriter), the RNTuple is immutable and cannot be amended.; An RNTuple that is currently being written cannot be read. ### RNTupleReader; The RNTupleReader is the primary interface to read and inspect an RNTuple.; An RNTupleReader owns a model: either a model created from the on-disk information or an imposed, user-provided model.; The user-provided model can be limited to a subset of fields.; Data is populated to an explicit `REntry` or the model's default entry through `RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`.

We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes. However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon. In those; cases, we have to keep track of the errors for those nodes which are; intermediate nodes of a cycle. An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call. If node ``A`` depends on node ``B`` then the path contains an ``A->B``; edge. From the call stack of the import functions, we can read the very same; path.

This set of threads doesn't change after; jump-threading, so the answer to the question posed above remains the same. .. _opportunistic_convergence:. Opportunistic convergent operations; -----------------------------------. Some programs have local regions of code that contain a sequence of convergent; operations where the code does not care about the exact set of threads with; which it is executed, but only that the set of threads is the same for all the; operations within the sequence. (If a subset of the convergent operations in the; sequence have additional, non-uniform control dependencies, then this is not; possible.

The function ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer``; returns the index into the buffer at which the calling thread should store its; data. This could be achieved by using a simple atomic operation in every thread to; bump an allocation counter. However, the following implementation can be more performant on some hardware,; because it uses only a single atomic operation for an entire group of threads.; To do this, it first determines the total size of the group, which will be the; operand to the atomic operation, and then later broadcasts the result of the; atomic operation to all threads of the group, s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst:11938,depend,dependencies,11938,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

How to specify the dependent BMIs; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

The option ``-fprebuilt-module-path`` tells the compiler the path where to search for dependent BMIs.; It may be used multiple times just like ``-I`` for specifying paths for header files. The look up rule here is:. * (1) When we import module M. The compiler would look up M.pcm in the directories specified; by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.; * (2) When we import partition module unit M:P. The compiler would look up M-P.pcm in the; directories specified by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``. The option ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI directly.; The option ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI; for the module specified by ``<module-name>`` when necessary. The main difference is that; ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` will load the BMI eagerly, whereas; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will only load the BMI lazily, which is similar; with ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.

All of the pass relationships that we have seen so far are very; simple: one pass depends on one other specific pass to be run before it can; run. For many applications, this is great, for others, more flexibility is; required. In particular, some analyses are defined such that there is a single simple; interface to the analysis results, but multiple ways of calculating them.; Consider alias analysis for example. The most trivial alias analysis returns; ""may alias"" for any alias query.

Analysis Groups can be given human readable names; just like passes, but unlike passes, they need not derive from the ``Pass``; class. An analysis group may have one or more implementations, one of which is; the ""default"" implementation. Analysis groups are used by client passes just like other passes are: the; ``AnalysisUsage::addRequired()`` and ``Pass::getAnalysis()`` methods. In order; to resolve this requirement, the :ref:`PassManager; <writing-an-llvm-pass-passmanager>` scans the available passes to see if any; implementations of the analysis group are available. If none is available, the; default implementation is created for the pass to use. All standard rules for; :ref:`interaction between passes <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>` still; apply.

The variable argument portion of the ``foreach`` block can contain dereferenced; lists, values to iterate, or a mix of both:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var ${my_list}); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var ${my_list} out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds. There is also a more modern CMake foreach syntax. The code below is equivalent; to the code above:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var IN ITEMS foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var IN LISTS my_list ITEMS out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds.

Integrability,"this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

If you need other abstract; frame information at safepoints (e.g. for deoptimization or introspection),; you can insert safepoint polls in the frontend. If you have the later case,; please ask on llvm-dev for suggestions. There's been a good amount of work; done on making such a scheme work well in practice which is not yet documented; here. Supported Architectures; =======================. Support for statepoint generation requires some code for each backend.; Today, only Aarch64 and X86_64 are supported. .. _OpenWork:. Limitations and Half Baked Ideas; ================================. Mixing References and Raw Pointers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Support for languages which allow unmanaged pointers to garbage collected; objects (i.e. pass a pointer to an object to a C routine) in the abstract; machine model. At the moment, the best idea on how to approach this; involves an intrinsic or opaque function which hides the connection between; the reference value and the raw pointer. The problem is that having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some colle",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst:34253,rout,routine,34253,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,1,['rout'],['routine']

In several cases, the misunderstanding of the interface caused invalid memory accesses to the already destructed; temporary `TString` returned by `GetString()`, e.g. `objStr->GetString().Data()`. This will be fixed automatically by the; new return type. In rare cases, the caller expected `GetString()` to return a (non-const) reference to the embedded `TString`, e.g.; `objString->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b""); // WRONG!` This will now fail to compile, instead of not doing what the author of the; code expected. Please fix that code by using the `TObjString::String()` interface, which returns a non-const `TString&`:; `objString->String().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b"");`. In extremely rare cases, this change breaks a valid use where the temporary `TString` was modified and then captured in a new `TString`; object before the destruction of the temporary: `TString str = objStr->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b"");`.

Then:. 1. ``%loop(1) == %loop(2)`` because of the dynamic rule about loop heart; intrinsics. 2. ``@op.1(1) == @op.1(2)`` because ``@op.1(i)`` uses the value of ``%loop``; referring to ``%loop(i)``, and ``%loop(1) == %loop(2)``. 3. Whether ``@op.2(1) == @op.2(2)`` is implementation-defined because of the; use of the ``%free`` anchor intrinsic. In practice, they almost certainly have to be non-converged dynamic; instances. Consider that if an implementation strictly follows the order of; instructions given in the program, the executions of the threads can be; ""aligned"" as follows:. .. code-block:: text. Thread 1: A B C D F B D E F G; Thread 2: A B D E F B C D F G. So then ``@op.2(1)`` physically executes later than ``@op.2(2)`` and there; can be no communication between the threads, which means they execute; non-converged dynamic instances. That said, it is conceivable that there aren't actually any data or other; dependencies that would enforce this execution order. In that case, a highly; out-of-order implementation could potentially allow communication. That's; why the rules defined in this document are silent about whether; ``@op.2(1) == @op.2(2)`` or not. This type of convergence control seems relatively unlikely to appear in real; programs. Its possibility is simply a logical consequence of the model.

Hence, only; a call-site in LLVM IR (a :ref:`call <i_call>`, :ref:`invoke; <i_invoke>`, or :ref:`callbr <i_callbr>` instruction) can result in a; convergent operation. A function in LLVM IR is said to be *convergent* if it has the; :ref:`convergent <attr_convergent>` attribute. A call-site in LLVM IR is said to be *convergent* if it is a direct; call to a convergent function or it has the :ref:`convergent; <attr_convergent>` attribute or a :ref:`convergencectrl operand bundle; <convergencectrl>`. Informational notes:. A function may have to be treated as convergent if that function, or; transitively, any function called from it, contains a convergent call-site. A; frontend generating the ``convergent`` attribute should take this into account; when emitting functions and function calls. But this is not always the case:. A non-convergent function may contain convergent operations; such operations; do not directly depend on the set of threads that enter the function as a; single communicating group.

Integrability,"throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------. Implementations of the Support Library interface are separated by their general; class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes are defined; but more could be added for other operating system classifications. To; distinguish which implementation to compile, the code in ``lib/Support`` uses; the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``_WIN32`` ``#defines``. Each source file in; ``lib/Support``, after implementing the generic (operating system independent); functionality needs to include the correct implementation using a set of; ``#if defined(LLVM_ON_XYZ)`` directives. For example, if we had; ``lib/Support/Path.cpp``, we'd expect to see in that file:. .. code-block:: c++. #if defined(LLVM_ON_UNIX); #include ""Unix/Path.inc""; #endif; #if defined(_WIN32); #include ""Windows/Path.inc""; #endif. The implementation in ``lib/Support/Unix/Path.inc`` should handle all Unix; variants. The implementation in ``lib/Support/Windows/Path.inc`` should handle; all Windows variants. What this does is quickly inc the basic class; of operating system that will provide the implementation. The specific details; for a given platform must still be determined through the use of ``#ifdef``. Consistent Semantics; --------------------. The implementation of a ``lib/Support`` interface can vary drastically between; platforms. That's okay as long as the end result of the interface function is; the same. For example, a function to create a directory is pretty straight; forward on all operating system. System V IPC on the other hand isn't even; supported on all platforms. Instead of ""supporting"" System V IPC,; ``lib/Support`` should provide an interface to the basic concept of; inter-process communications. The implementations might use System V IPC if; that was available or named pipes, or whatever gets the job done effectively; for a given operating system. In all cases, the interface and the; implementation must be semantically consistent.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:11173,interface,interface,11173,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,4,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"ti-dimensional functions they should instead use this interface. * `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`: This interface provides the `double operator() (const double*)` that takes an array of doubles with all the values for the different dimensions. In this case,; the user has to provide the functionality for two different functions: `double DoEval(const double*)` and `unsigned int NDim()`. The first ones evaluates the function given the array that represents; the multiple variables. The second returns the number of dimensions of the function. Example of implementing a basic multi-dimensional function:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim; {; public:; double DoEval(const double* x) const; {; return x[0] + sin(x[1]);; }. unsigned int NDim() const; {; return 2;; }.

This method must implement the derivative of the function with respect to the variable indicated with the; second parameter. Example of implementing a multi-dimensional gradient function. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyGradientFunction: public ROOT::Math::IGradientFunctionMultiDim; {; public:; double DoEval(const double* x) const; {; return x[0] + sin(x[1]);; }. unsigned int NDim() const; {; return 2;; }.

You can do most of the communication with your email client (see section on; Setting up email interactions above). You only need to set up your account once; and then configure which categories you want to subscribe to. ### How do I send a private message?. On the mailing list you have the opportunity to reply only to the sender of; the email, not to the entire list. That is not supported when replying via; email on Discourse. However you can send someone a private message via the; Web UI: Click on the user's name above a post and then on `Message`. Also Discourse does not expose users' email addresses , so your private; replies have to go through their platform (unless you happen to know the; email address of the user.). ### How can my script/tool send automatic messages?**. In case you want to [create a new; post/topic](https://docs.discourse.org/#tag/Posts/paths/~1posts.json/post); automatically from a script or tool, you can use the; [Discourse API](https://docs.discourse.org/). ### Who are the admins for Discourse?.

Integrability,"ting a change; -------------------. Once a patch has been reviewed and approved on Phabricator it can then be; committed to trunk. If you do not have commit access, someone has to; commit the change for you (with attribution). It is sufficient to add; a comment to the approved review indicating you cannot commit the patch; yourself. If you have commit access, there are multiple workflows to commit the; change. Whichever method you follow it is recommended that your commit message; ends with the line:. ::. Differential Revision: <URL>. where ``<URL>`` is the URL for the code review, starting with; ``https://reviews.llvm.org/``. This allows people reading the version history to see the review for; context. This also allows Phabricator to detect the commit, close the; review, and add a link from the review to the commit. Note that if you use the Arcanist tool the ``Differential Revision`` line will; be added automatically. If you don't want to use Arcanist, you can add the; ``Differential Revision`` line (as the last line) to the commit message; yourself. Using the Arcanist tool can simplify the process of committing reviewed code as; it will retrieve reviewers, the ``Differential Revision``, etc from the review; and place it in the commit message. You may also commit an accepted change; directly using ``git push``, per the section in the :ref:`getting started; guide <commit_from_git>`. Note that if you commit the change without using Arcanist and forget to add the; ``Differential Revision`` line to your commit message then it is recommended; that you close the review manually.

Integrability,"tion Code Generation; ========================. Code generation for prototypes and functions must handle a number of; details, which make their code less beautiful than expression code; generation, but allows us to illustrate some important points. First,; let's talk about code generation for prototypes: they are used both for; function bodies and external function declarations. The code starts; with:. .. code-block:: c++. Function *PrototypeAST::codegen() {; // Make the function type: double(double,double) etc.; std::vector<Type*> Doubles(Args.size(),; Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext));; FunctionType *FT =; FunctionType::get(Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext), Doubles, false);. Function *F =; Function::Create(FT, Function::ExternalLinkage, Name, TheModule.get());. This code packs a lot of power into a few lines. Note first that this; function returns a ""Function\*"" instead of a ""Value\*"". Because a; ""prototype"" really talks about the external interface for a function; (not the value computed by an expression), it makes sense for it to; return the LLVM Function it corresponds to when codegen'd. The call to ``FunctionType::get`` creates the ``FunctionType`` that; should be used for a given Prototype. Since all function arguments in; Kaleidoscope are of type double, the first line creates a vector of ""N""; LLVM double types. It then uses the ``Functiontype::get`` method to; create a function type that takes ""N"" doubles as arguments, returns one; double as a result, and that is not vararg (the false parameter; indicates this). Note that Types in LLVM are uniqued just like Constants; are, so you don't ""new"" a type, you ""get"" it. The final line above actually creates the IR Function corresponding to; the Prototype. This indicates the type, linkage and name to use, as; well as which module to insert into. ""`external; linkage <../../LangRef.html#linkage>`_"" means that the function may be; defined outside the current module and/or that it is callable by; functions outside the modul",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl03.rst:11560,interface,interface,11560,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl03.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl03.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"tion and machine code representation classes, ensuring that it is; portable. Required components in the code generator; -----------------------------------------. The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the; code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build; target-specific backends. The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used. This design has two important implications. The first is that LLVM can support; completely non-traditional code generation targets. For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be required; for radically different targets that do not fit into the LLVM machine; description model: FPGAs for example. .. _high-level design of the code generator:. The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------.

This will be fixed automatically by the; new return type. In rare cases, the caller expected `GetString()` to return a (non-const) reference to the embedded `TString`, e.g.; `objString->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b""); // WRONG!` This will now fail to compile, instead of not doing what the author of the; code expected.

Integrability,"tion is directly; responsible is the :arc-term:`formal local retain history` of the; object pointer. The corresponding actual sequence executed is the; `dynamic local retain history`. However, under certain circumstances, ARC is permitted to re-order and; eliminate operations in a manner which may alter the overall; computation history beyond what is permitted by the general ""as if""; rule of C/C++ and the :ref:`restrictions <arc.objects.retains>` on; the implementation of ``retain`` and ``release``. .. admonition:: Rationale. Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be. Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions. ARC may assume that any retainable object pointers it receives or; generates are instantaneously valid from that point until a point; which, by the concurrency model of the host language, happens-after; the generation of the pointer and happens-before a release of that; object (possibly via an aliasing pointer or indirectly due to; destruction of a different object). .. admonition:: Rationale.

The boundary of the interval is equivalent to a MINUIT/MINOS contour about the maximum likelihood estimator. . HybridCalculator: hypothesis test calculator using a Bayesian-frequentist hybrid method (often called in HEP as CLs method). This class extends the functionality of the TLimit class by taking advantage of the RooFit package. The result of the calculator is returned as an HybridResult pointer. HybridResult implements the HypoTestResult interface. The class HybridPlot allows for a graphical representation of a HybridResult.; ; HybridCalculator implements the interface class HypoTestCalculator. A constructor exists taking as input the pdf's (expressed as RooAbsPdf instances) for the signal+background (alternate) and background only (null) hypothesis and the data set (as RooAbsData instance). One can provide optionally also the nuisance parameters and its pdf which will be marginalized by the calculator.

If you are interested in making a large change, and this scares you, please make; sure to first `discuss the change/gather consensus`_ then ask about the best way; to go about making the change. Attribution of Changes; ----------------------. When contributors submit a patch to an LLVM project, other developers with; commit access may commit it for the author once appropriate (based on the; progression of code review, etc.). When doing so, it is important to retain; correct attribution of contributions to their contributors. However, we do not; want the source code to be littered with random attributions ""this code written; by J. Random Hacker"" (this is noisy and distracting). In practice, the revision; control system keeps a perfect history of who changed what, and the CREDITS.txt; file describes higher-level contributions. If you commit a patch for someone; else, please follow the attribution of changes in the simple manner as outlined; by the `commit messages`_ section. Overall, please do not add contributor names; to the source code. Also, don't commit patches authored by others unless they have submitted the; patch to the project or you have been authorized to submit them on their behalf; (you work together and your company authorized you to contribute the patches,; etc.). The author should first submit them to the relevant project's commit; list, development list, or LLVM bug tracker component. If someone sends you; a patch privately, encourage them to submit it to the appropriate list first. Our previous version control system (subversion) did not distinguish between the; author and the committer like git does. As such, older commits used a different; attribution mechanism. The previous method was to include ""Patch by John Doe.""; in a separate line of the commit message and there are automated processes that; rely on this format. .. _IR backwards compatibility:.

Integrability,"tion with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and ``wait``. The; correct thing for ``lib/Support`` to provide is a function, say; ``ExecuteProgramAndWait``, that implements the functionality completely. what; we don't want is wrappers for the operating system calls involved. There must **not** be a one-to-one relationship between operating system; calls and the Support library's interface. Any such interface function will be; suspicious. No Unused Functionality; -----------------------. There must be no functionality specified in the interface of ``lib/Support``; that isn't actually used by LLVM. We're not writing a general purpose operating; system wrapper here, just enough to satisfy LLVM's needs. And, LLVM doesn't; need much. This design goal aims to keep the ``lib/Support`` interface small and; understandable which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems supported for a given class of operating system (e.g. Unix, Win32). No Virtual Methods; ------------------. The Support Library interfaces can be called quite frequently by LLVM. In order; to make those calls as efficient as possible, we discourage the use of virtual; methods. There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------.

For example,; this line fits histogram object `hist` with a Gaussian. ``` {.cpp}; root[] hist.Fit(""gaus"");; ```. The initial parameter values (and eventual limits) for pre-defined functions are set; automatically. For overriding the default limits values use the fit option `B`. The list of pre-defined functions that can be used with the `Fit` method is the following:. - ""`gaus`"" Gaussian function with 3 parameters:; `f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2)`. - ""`expo`""An Exponential with 2 parameters: `f(x) = exp(p0+p1*x)`. - ""`pol`*`N`*"" A polynomial of degree *N*, where N is a number between 0 and 9:; `f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*x2 +...`. - ""`chebyshev`*`N`*"" A Chebyshev polynomial of degree *N*, where N is a number between 0 and 9:; `f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*(2*x2-1) +...`. - ""`landau`"" Landau function with mean and sigma. This function has; been adapted from the `CERNLIB` routine `G110 denlan` (see `TMath::Landau`). - ""`gausn`"" Normalized form of the gaussian function with 3 parameters; `f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2)/(p2 *sqrt(2PI))`. ### Creating User-Defined Functions (TF1). You can create a **`TF1`** object and use it in the call the; `TH1::Fit`. The parameter in to the `Fit` method is the NAME of; the **`TF1`** object. There are three ways to create a **`TF1`**. - Using C++ expression using x with a fixed set of operators and; functions defined in **`TFormula`**. - Same as first one, with parameters. - Using a function that you have defined. This can be a free function or; a functor object or a particular member function of a class. #### Creating a TF1 with a Formula. Let's look at the first case. Here we call the **`TF1`** constructor; by giving it the formula: `sin(x)/x`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TF1 *f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""sin(x)/x"",0,10); ```.

The next section explains how subscripting expressions map to accessor; methods. Subscripting Methods; --------------------. Objective-C supports two kinds of subscript expressions: *array-style*; subscript expressions use integer typed subscripts; *dictionary-style*; subscript expressions use Objective-C object pointer typed subscripts.; Each type of subscript expression is mapped to a message send using a; predefined selector. The advantage of this design is flexibility: class; designers are free to introduce subscripting by declaring methods or by; adopting protocols. Moreover, because the method names are selected by; the type of the subscript, an object can be subscripted using both array; and dictionary styles. Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When the subscript operand has an integral type, the expression is; rewritten to use one of two different selectors, depending on whether; the element is being read or written. When an expression reads an; element using an integral index, as in the following example:. .. code-block:: objc. NSUInteger idx = ...;; id value = object[idx];. it is translated into a call to ``objectAtIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. id value = [object objectAtIndexedSubscript:idx];. When an expression writes an element using an integral index:. .. code-block:: objc. object[idx] = newValue;. it is translated to a call to ``setObject:atIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. [object setObject:newValue atIndexedSubscript:idx];. These message sends are then type-checked and performed just like; explicit message sends. The method used for objectAtIndexedSubscript:; must be declared with an argument of integral type and a return value of; some Objective-C object pointer type.

The ``symbolAliases`` function allows you to define aliases within a single; JITDylib. The ``reexports`` function provides the same functionality, but; operates across JITDylib boundaries. E.g. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD1 = ... ;; auto &JD2 = ... ;. // Make 'bar' in JD2 an alias for 'foo' from JD1.; JD2.define(; reexports(JD1, SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""bar""), { Mangle(""foo""), JITSymbolFlags::Exported } }; });.

Laziness in ORC is provided by a utility called ""lazy reexports"". A lazy; reexport is similar to a regular reexport or alias: It provides a new name for; an existing symbol.

This function stub is; initialized to point at a *lazy call-through*, which provides reentry into the; JIT. If the stub is called at runtime then the lazy call-through will look up; the reexported symbol (triggering materialization for it if necessary), update; the stub (to call directly to the reexported symbol on subsequent calls), and; then return via the reexported symbol.

If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic,; higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant; runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by `rootreadspeed` (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis; applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and; RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly; when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; See also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PPP138) (slides 16 to 19).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:4292,interface,interfaces,4292,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.).

MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user.

Integrability,"to be prepared to reverse-engineer; the linearization. One way to solve this problem is to use the ScalarEvolution; library, which always presents VLA and non-VLA indexing in the same manner. .. _Rules:. Rules; =====. What happens if an array index is out of bounds?; ------------------------------------------------. There are two senses in which an array index can be out of bounds. First, there's the array type which comes from the (static) type of the first; operand to the GEP. Indices greater than the number of elements in the; corresponding static array type are valid. There is no problem with out of; bounds indices in this sense. Indexing into an array only depends on the size of; the array element, not the number of elements. A common example of how this is used is arrays where the size is not known.; It's common to use array types with zero length to represent these. The fact; that the static type says there are zero elements is irrelevant; it's perfectly; valid to compute arbitrary element indices, as the computation only depends on; the size of the array element, not the number of elements. Note that zero-sized; arrays are not a special case here. This sense is unconnected with ``inbounds`` keyword. The ``inbounds`` keyword is; designed to describe low-level pointer arithmetic overflow conditions, rather; than high-level array indexing rules. Analysis passes which wish to understand array indexing should not assume that; the static array type bounds are respected. The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if the; address is outside the actual underlying allocated object and not the address; one-past-the-end. Without the ``inbounds`` keyword, there are no restrictions on computing; out-of-bounds addresses. Obviously, performing a load or a store requires an; address of allocated and sufficiently aligned memory.

Integrability,"to one register file so that we minimize the cost of copying data; back and forth to satisfy the (possibly conflicting) requirements of all the; instructions.

They can typically store; the same data but there's usually some restrictions on what operations you can; do on each register file. A fairly common pattern is for one of them to be; accessible to integer operations and the other accessible to floating point; operations. To accommodate this, let's rename A and B to GPR (general purpose; registers) and FPR (floating point registers). We now have some additional constraints that limit us. An operation like G_FMUL; has to happen in FPR and G_ADD has to happen in GPR. However, even though this; prescribes a lot of the assignments we still have some freedom. A G_LOAD can; happen in both GPR and FPR, and which we want depends on who is going to consume; the loaded data. Similarly, G_FNEG can happen in both GPR and FPR. If we assign; it to FPR, then we'll use floating point negation. However, if we assign it to; GPR then we can equivalently G_XOR the sign bit with 1 to invert it.

Integrability,"to read-only and allow pushes to the GitHub repository.; 11. Update the documentation.; 12. Mirror Git to SVN. Step #4 : Post Move; -------------------. 13. Archive the SVN repository.; 14. Update links on the LLVM website pointing to viewvc/klaus/phab etc. to; point to GitHub instead. GitHub Repository Description; =============================. Monorepo; ----------------. The LLVM git repository hosted at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project contains all; sub-projects in a single source tree. It is often referred to as a monorepo and; mimics an export of the current SVN repository, with each sub-project having its; own top-level directory. Not all sub-projects are used for building toolchains.; For example, www/ and test-suite/ are not part of the monorepo. Putting all sub-projects in a single checkout makes cross-project refactoring; naturally simple:. * New sub-projects can be trivially split out for better reuse and/or layering; (e.g., to allow libSupport and/or LIT to be used by runtimes without adding a; dependency on LLVM).; * Changing an API in LLVM and upgrading the sub-projects will always be done in; a single commit, designing away a common source of temporary build breakage.; * Moving code across sub-project (during refactoring for instance) in a single; commit enables accurate `git blame` when tracking code change history.; * Tooling based on `git grep` works natively across sub-projects, allowing to; easier find refactoring opportunities across projects (for example reusing a; datastructure initially in LLDB by moving it into libSupport).; * Having all the sources present encourages maintaining the other sub-projects; when changing API. Finally, the monorepo maintains the property of the existing SVN repository that; the sub-projects move synchronously, and a single revision number (or commit; hash) identifies the state of the development across all projects. .. _build_single_project:.

Integrability,"to report clear error messages with accurate source; file locations. To make error reporting easier, five error reporting; functions are provided, each with four overloads. * ``PrintWarning`` prints a message tagged as a warning. * ``PrintError`` prints a message tagged as an error. * ``PrintFatalError`` prints a message tagged as an error and then terminates. * ``PrintNote`` prints a note. It is often used after one of the previous; functions to provide more information. * ``PrintFatalNote`` prints a note and then terminates. Each of these five functions is overloaded four times. * ``PrintError(const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message with no source file location. * ``PrintError(ArrayRef<SMLoc> ErrorLoc, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the specified source line,; along with a pointer to the item in error. The array of; source file locations is typically taken from a ``Record`` instance. * ``PrintError(const Record *Rec, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record (see `Record`_). * ``PrintError(const RecordVal *RecVal, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record field (see `RecordVal`_). Using these functions, the goal is to produce the most specific error report; possible. Debugging Tools; ===============. TableGen provides some tools to aid in debugging backends. The ``PrintRecords`` Backend; ----------------------------. The TableGen command option ``--print-records`` invokes a simple backend; that prints all the classes and records defined in the source files. This is; the default backend option.

Integrability,"together"", i.e.,; convergently. A value is said to be *uniform* across a set of threads if it is the; same across those threads, and *divergent* otherwise. Correspondingly,; a branch is said to be a uniform branch if its condition is uniform,; and it is a divergent branch otherwise. Whether threads are *converged* or not depends on the paths they take; through the control flow graph. Threads take different outgoing edges; at a *divergent branch*. Divergent branches constrain; program transforms such as changing the CFG or moving a convergent; operation to a different point of the CFG. Performing these; transformations across a divergent branch can change the sets of; threads that execute convergent operations convergently. While these; constraints are out of scope for this document, the described; *uniformity analysis* allows these transformations to identify; uniform branches where these constraints do not hold. Convergence and; uniformity are inter-dependent: When threads diverge at a divergent; branch, they may later *reconverge* at a common program point.; Subsequent operations are performed convergently, but the inputs may; be non-uniform, thus producing divergent outputs. Uniformity is also useful by itself on targets that execute threads in; groups with shared execution resources (e.g. waves, warps, or; subgroups):. - Uniform outputs can potentially be computed or stored on shared; resources.; - These targets must ""linearize"" a divergent branch to ensure that; each side of the branch is followed by the corresponding threads in; the same group. But linearization is unnecessary at uniform; branches, since the whole group of threads follows either one side; of the branch or the other. This document presents a definition of convergence that is reasonable; for real targets and is compatible with the currently implicit; semantics of convergent operations in LLVM IR. This is accompanied by; a *uniformity analysis* that extends previous work on divergence analysis; [D",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergenceAndUniformity.rst:1380,depend,dependent,1380,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergenceAndUniformity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergenceAndUniformity.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

In order to fit a data sets we need a model to describe our data, e.g. a probability density function describing our observed data or; an hypothetical function describing the relation between the independent variables **`X`** and the single dependent variable `Y`.; We can have an arbitrary number `k` of independent variables. For example, when fitting a `k`-dimensional histogram,; the independent variables **`X`** are the bin center coordinates and `Y` is the bin weight. The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters.

A signal is a normal class method. **The first requirement** is that it should call an `Emit()` method. The format of this method is the following:. ``` {.cpp}; Emit(""full_method_name""[,arguments]);; ```. where `""full_method_name""` is the method name and prototype string of the signal method.; For example, for `SetValue(Int_t value)` the full method name will be `""SetValue(Int_t)""`, where `SetValue` is the method name and `Int_t` the prototype string. Note that typedefs will be resolved to facilitate matching of slots to signals. So the slot `""print(int)""` can be connected to the above signal which has an `Int_t` as argument. **The second requirement** is that the method declaration should have the string `*SIGNAL*` in its comment field. Like:. ``` {.cpp}; void SetValue(Int_t x); //*SIGNAL*; ```. This provides an explicit interface specification for the user (this requirement is currently not enforced at run-time). **The third requirement**, only necessary if you want to have class signals (i.e. for all objects of a class), is that you have to replace the standard `ClassImp` macro by `ClassImpQ`. Signals are currently implemented for all ROOT GUI classes and the [TTimer](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTTimer.html) and [TCanvas](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTCanvas.html) classes (to find quickly all defined signals do for example: `grep '*SIGNAL*' $ROOTSYS/include/*.h`). ## Examples. ### A First Time Example ([rqfirst.C](http://root.cern.ch/root/rqex/rqfirst.C)).

Code generation for function calls is quite straightforward with LLVM. The code; above initially does a function name lookup in the LLVM Module's symbol table.; Recall that the LLVM Module is the container that holds the functions we are; JIT'ing. By giving each function the same name as what the user specifies, we; can use the LLVM symbol table to resolve function names for us. Once we have the function to call, we recursively codegen each argument; that is to be passed in, and create an LLVM `call; instruction <../../LangRef.html#call-instruction>`_. Note that LLVM uses the native C; calling conventions by default, allowing these calls to also call into; standard library functions like ""sin"" and ""cos"", with no additional; effort. This wraps up our handling of the four basic expressions that we have so; far in Kaleidoscope. Feel free to go in and add some more. For example,; by browsing the `LLVM language reference <../../LangRef.html>`_ you'll find; several other interesting instructions that are really easy to plug into; our basic framework. Function Code Generation; ========================. Code generation for prototypes and functions must handle a number of; details, which make their code less beautiful than expression code; generation, but allows us to illustrate some important points. First,; let's talk about code generation for prototypes: they are used both for; function bodies and external function declarations. The code starts; with:. .. code-block:: c++.

The pointer is used in a volatile access as its address. .. _volatile:. Volatile Memory Accesses; ------------------------. Certain memory accesses, such as :ref:`load <i_load>`'s,; :ref:`store <i_store>`'s, and :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`'s may be; marked ``volatile``. The optimizers must not change the number of; volatile operations or change their order of execution relative to other; volatile operations. The optimizers *may* change the order of volatile; operations relative to non-volatile operations. This is not Java's; ""volatile"" and has no cross-thread synchronization behavior. A volatile load or store may have additional target-specific semantics.; Any volatile operation can have side effects, and any volatile operation; can read and/or modify state which is not accessible via a regular load; or store in this module. Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited. If a; non-volatile store to a given address would be legal, a volatile; operation may modify the memory at that address. A volatile operation; may not modify any other memory accessible by the module being compiled.; A volatile operation may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed.

Integrability,"tors used by entities within the AST file. The design; of the method pool is similar to that of the :ref:`identifier table; <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the first time a particular selector is formed; during the compilation of the program, Clang will search in the on-disk hash; table of selectors; if found, Clang will read the Objective-C methods; associated with that selector into the appropriate front-end data structure; (``Sema::InstanceMethodPool`` and ``Sema::FactoryMethodPool`` for instance and; class methods, respectively). As with identifiers, selectors are represented by numeric values within the AST; file. A separate index maps these numeric selector values to the offset of the; selector within the on-disk hash table, and will be used when de-serializing an; Objective-C method declaration (or other Objective-C construct) that refers to; the selector. AST Reader Integration Points; -----------------------------. The ""lazy"" deserialization behavior of AST files requires their integration; into several completely different submodules of Clang. For example, lazily; deserializing the declarations during name lookup requires that the name-lookup; routines be able to query the AST file to find entities stored there. For each Clang data structure that requires direct interaction with the AST; reader logic, there is an abstract class that provides the interface between; the two modules. The ``ASTReader`` class, which handles the loading of an AST; file, inherits from all of these abstract classes to provide lazy; deserialization of Clang's data structures. ``ASTReader`` implements the; following abstract classes:. ``ExternalSLocEntrySource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``SourceManager`` class, and; is used whenever the :ref:`source manager <pchinternals-sourcemgr>` needs to; load the details of a file, buffer, or macro instantiation. ``IdentifierInfoLookup``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``IdentifierTable`` class, and; is used ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:21566,integrat,integration,21566,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration']

LLVM currently has no target-independent means to model predicated; vector instructions for modern SIMD ISAs such as AVX512, ARM SVE, the RISC-V V; extension and NEC SX-Aurora. Only some predicated vector operations, such as; masked loads and stores, are available through intrinsics [MaskedIR]_. The Vector Predication (VP) extensions is a concrete RFC and prototype; implementation to achieve native vector predication in LLVM. The VP prototype; and all related discussions can be found in the VP patch on Phabricator; [VPRFC]_. Roadmap; =======. 1. IR-level VP intrinsics; -------------------------. - There is a consensus on the semantics/instruction set of VP.; - VP intrinsics and attributes are available on IR level.; - TTI has capability flags for VP (``supportsVP()``?,; ``haveActiveVectorLength()``?). Result: VP usable for IR-level vectorizers (LV, VPlan, RegionVectorizer),; potential integration in Clang with builtins. 2. CodeGen support; ------------------. - VP intrinsics translate to first-class SDNodes; (eg ``llvm.vp.fdiv.* -> vp_fdiv``).; - VP legalization (legalize explicit vector length to mask (AVX512), legalize VP; SDNodes to pre-existing ones (SSE, NEON)). Result: Backend development based on VP SDNodes. 3. Lift InstSimplify/InstCombine/DAGCombiner to VP; --------------------------------------------------. - Introduce PredicatedInstruction, PredicatedBinaryOperator, .. helper classes; that match standard vector IR and VP intrinsics.; - Add a matcher context to PatternMatch and context-aware IR Builder APIs.; - Incrementally lift DAGCombiner to work on VP SDNodes as well as on regular; vector instructions.; - Incrementally lift InstCombine/InstSimplify to operate on VP as well as; regular IR instructions.

Integrability,"tptrtype:. Non-Integral Pointer Type; -------------------------. Note: non-integral pointer types are a work in progress, and they should be; considered experimental at this time. LLVM IR optionally allows the frontend to denote pointers in certain address; spaces as ""non-integral"" via the :ref:`datalayout string<langref_datalayout>`.; Non-integral pointer types represent pointers that have an *unspecified* bitwise; representation; that is, the integral representation may be target dependent or; unstable (not backed by a fixed integer). ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` instructions have the same semantics as for; integral (i.e. normal) pointers in that they convert integers to and from; corresponding pointer types, but there are additional implications to be; aware of. Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:29076,depend,depends,29076,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

It also explains some of the finer; points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview; ================================. The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__; class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations; should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and; ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref; query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in; several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a; starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual; ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to; get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple; values, values which are not :ref:`constants <constants>` are all; defined within the same function. Representation of Pointers; --------------------------. Most importantly, the ``AliasAnalysis`` class provides several methods which are; used to query whether or not two memory objects alias, whether function calls; can modify or read a memory object, etc. For all of these queries, memory; objects are represented as a pair of their starting address (a symbolic LLVM; ``Value*``) and a static size. Representing memory objects as a starting address and a size is critically; important for correct Alias Analyses. For example, consider this (silly, but; possible) C code:. .. code-block:: c++. int i;; char C[2];; char A[10];; /* ... */; for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {; C[0] = A[i]; /* One byte store */; C[1] = A[9-i]; /* One byte store */; }.

Integrability,"trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true. In the example below, pointer ``p``; annotated with ``__counted_by(count)`` must always point to a memory buffer; containing at least ``count`` elements of the pointee type. Changing the value; of ``count``, like in the example below, may violate this invariant and permit; out-of-bounds access to the pointer. To avoid this, the compiler employs; compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as necessary to ensure the; new count value doesn't exceed the actual length of the buffer. Section; `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_ provides more details about; this programming model. .. code-block:: c. int g;. void foo(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; count++; // may violate the invariant of __counted_by; count--; // may violate the invariant of __counted_by if count was 0.; count = g; // may violate the invariant of __counted_by; // depending on the value of `g`.; }. The requirement to annotate all pointers with explicit bounds information could; present a significant adoption burden. To tackle this issue, the model; incorporates the concept of a ""wide pointer"" (a.k.a. fat pointer) – a larger; pointer that carries bounds information alongside the pointer value. Utilizing; wide pointers can potentially reduce the adoption burden, as it contains bounds; information internally and eliminates the need for explicit bounds annotations.; However, wide pointers differ from standard C pointers in their data layout,; which may result in incompatibilities with the application binary interface; (ABI). Breaking the ABI complicates interoperability with external code that has; not adopted the same programming model. ``-fbounds-safety`` harmonizes the wide pointer and the bounds annotation; approaches to reduce the adoption burden while maintaining the ABI.

Integrability,"trated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions.

There are only two alternatives: precompile headers into LLVM bitcode and; distribute those or provide a restricted set of headers.; Precompiled headers (and modules) were never designed to be portable and; relocatable, however, thus that may not be the panacea it seems.; A restricted set of headers is some work, but cppyy can operate on abstract; interface classes just fine (including Python-side cross-inheritance). `Large deployment`; ------------------. The single biggest headache in maintaining an installation of Python; extension modules is that Python patch releases can break them.; The two typical solutions are to either restrict the choice of Python; interpreter and version that are supported (common in HPC) or to provide; binaries (wheels) for a large range of different interpreters and versions; (as e.g. done for conda). In the case of cppyy, only CPython/CPyCppyy and PyPy/_cppyy (an internal; module) depend on the Python interpreter (see:; :ref:`Package Structure <package-structure>`).; The user-facing ``cppyy`` module is pure Python and the backend (Cling) is; Python-independent.; Most importantly, since all bindings are generated at run-time, there are no; extension modules to regenerate and/or recompile. Thus, the end-user only needs to rebuild/reinstall CPyCppyy for each relevant; version of Python (and nothing extra is needed for PyPy) to switch Python; versions and/or interpreter.; The rest of the software stack remains completely unchanged.; Only if Cling in cppyy's backend is updated, which happens infrequently, and; non-standard precompiled headers or modules are used, do these need to be; rebuild in full. .. _`SWIG`: http://swig.org/; .. _`pybind11`: https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/; .. _`PyPy`: https://www.pypy.org/; .. _`CINT`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINT; .. _`LLVM`: https://llvm.org/; .. _`Numba`: http://numba.pydata.org/; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:11119,depend,depend,11119,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

It creates a diagnostic and; accepts the arguments, ranges, and other information that goes along with it. For example, the binary expression error comes from code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if (various things that are bad); Diag(Loc, diag::err_typecheck_invalid_operands); << lex->getType() << rex->getType(); << lex->getSourceRange() << rex->getSourceRange();. This shows that use of the ``Diag`` method: it takes a location (a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` object) and a diagnostic enum value; (which matches the name from ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td``). If the diagnostic takes; arguments, they are specified with the ``<<`` operator: the first argument; becomes ``%0``, the second becomes ``%1``, etc. The diagnostic interface; allows you to specify arguments of many different types, including ``int`` and; ``unsigned`` for integer arguments, ``const char*`` and ``std::string`` for; string arguments, ``DeclarationName`` and ``const IdentifierInfo *`` for names,; ``QualType`` for types, etc. ``SourceRange``\ s are also specified with the; ``<<`` operator, but do not have a specific ordering requirement. As you can see, adding and producing a diagnostic is pretty straightforward.; The hard part is deciding exactly what you need to say to help the user,; picking a suitable wording, and providing the information needed to format it; correctly. The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^.

This allows to change the integration algorithm used in `TF1` using the static methods of the classes; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`.

Integrability,"two-phase compilation since it takes; 2 steps to compile a source file to an object file. The style to generate BMIs by ``-fmodule-output``; is called one-phase compilation respectively. The one-phase compilation model is simpler; for build systems to implement and the two-phase compilation has the potential to compile faster due; to higher parallelism. As an example, if there are two module units A and B, and B depends on A, the; one-phase compilation model would need to compile them serially, whereas the two-phase compilation; model may be able to compile them simultaneously if the compilation from A.pcm to A.o takes a long; time. File name requirement; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The file name of an ``importable module unit`` should end with ``.cppm``; (or ``.ccm``, ``.cxxm``, ``.c++m``). The file name of a ``module implementation unit``; should end with ``.cpp`` (or ``.cc``, ``.cxx``, ``.c++``). The file name of BMIs should end with ``.pcm``.; The file name of the BMI of a ``primary module interface unit`` should be ``module_name.pcm``.; The file name of BMIs of ``module partition unit`` should be ``module_name-partition_name.pcm``. If the file names use different extensions, Clang may fail to build the module.; For example, if the filename of an ``importable module unit`` ends with ``.cpp`` instead of ``.cppm``,; then we can't generate a BMI for the ``importable module unit`` by ``--precompile`` option; since ``--precompile`` option now would only run preprocessor, which is equal to `-E` now.; If we want the filename of an ``importable module unit`` ends with other suffixes instead of ``.cppm``,; we could put ``-x c++-module`` in front of the file. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. // Hello.cpp; module;; #include <iostream>; export module Hello;; export void hello() {; std::cout << ""Hello World!\n"";; }. // use.cpp; import Hello;; int main() {; hello();; return 0;; }. Now the filename of the ``module interface`` ends with ``.cpp`` instead of ``.cppm``,; we can't com",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:8631,interface,interface,8631,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
