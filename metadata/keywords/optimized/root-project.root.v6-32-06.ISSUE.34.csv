Integrability,"The idea of the RooGenProdProj is that we divide two integral objects; each created with this makeIntgral() function to get the normalized; integral of a product. Therefore, we don't need to normalize the; numerater and denominator integrals themselves. Doing the normalization; would be expensive and it would cancel out anyway. However, if we don't; specify an explicit normalization integral in createIntegral(), the; last-used normalization set might be used to normalize the pdf,; resulting in redundant computations. For this reason, the normalization set of the integrated pdfs is fixed; to an empty set in this case. Note that in RooFit, a nullptr; normalization set and an empty normalization set is not equivalent. The; former implies taking the last-used normalization set, and the latter; means explicitly no normalization. This fixes the performance regression reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11814, and a new unit; test is implemented to make sure no new numeric integrals pop up in the; reproducer code to that issue.

Integrability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings. The new name,; RDefine, clearly describes what the class is supposed to do and it is in; line with RDF's naming convention (we already have RFilter).

Integrability,"The only thing I see fixable (and not breaking existing use cases) is the case for returning integer types. Details:; - Unloading a transaction also unloads its generated code, AST, etc - that's violating a contract that existing uses rely on.; - `Calc` etc return whatever cast to long, since CINT, return a reference (cast to long) for ""objects"". As you know that means the temporary must be stored until the end of the process. Bad interface, but it is what it is, and breaking the interface contract is out of question.; - Memory allocated by `MachineFunctionPass` is likely the object code output of the JIT.

Integrability,"The original issue is with some python tutorial failing on macOS nodes due to; ```; <TNetXNGFile::Open>: [FATAL] Auth failed; ```; Which in turn is due to a failure in loading some xrootd security libraries, among which; ```; [Error ][Utility ] Unable to pre-load libXrdSecpwd.so: Plugin unable to load libXrdSecpwd-4.so; dlopen(libXrdSecpwd-4.so, 256): image not found; ```. This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```. This `LC_RPATH` variable is set for our own libraries, e.g. `libHtml.so`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libHtml.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib (offset 12); ```; But for some reason this information is lost after building `builtin_xrootd` (probably while installing the libraries from the prefix to the install directory). A way to solve this is by manually adding the `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` option to the `cmake` invokation of `builtin_xrootd` as is done in this PR.

Integrability,"The previous implementation required TGeoTessellated shapes to be read attached to a TGeoManager. This removes the limitation, and allows also reading geometry files containing shapes converted to VecGeom corresponding solids. # This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:; * Restructured the `TGeoFacet` helper class, eliminating referencing vertices stored in the associated `TGeoTessellated` object, since this required calling a specific method `TGeoTessellated::AfterStreamer` to fix all the facet objects. The new version moves all vertex operations from TGeoFacet to the TGeoTessellated class, making the latter readable from a root file even if not connected to a `TGeoManager`; * Added persistency to the class `TGeoVGShape` which interfaces `TGeoShape` to `vecgeom::VPlacedVolume`. This allows to write/read geometry files after being converted to VecGeom. Upon reading, a check is made that the current root version was also compiled with VecGeom support, and if this is not the case a `Fatal` exception is fired. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166:126,wrap,wrapper,126,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"The work of this MR has been presented in RooFit developer meetings a few times already. However, I would like to put this forward not as a ""final MR"" (would need to be rebased anyway), but as a way to get a preliminary review of this code. Purpose: HistFactory and RooWorkspace should be able to import and export their contents from and to text files, using a common JSON/YAML syntax. Method: The code has been written in such a way as to. - Minimize the amount of changes to existing code; - Make it as easy as possible for users to add new serializers/deserializers for new or existing classes; - Provide a clean interface as much as possible. Dependencies: The code requires a JSON/YML parser and emitter.; ROOT already includes the nlohmann JSON module, which is used as a default for the interface.; However, for development, I have been using the rapidyml package, which also supports reading and writing of YML files. As the code for this already exists, I have kept this in as an optional dependency. When available, it replaces the nlohmann interface and then also provides YML reading and writing capabilities, while the default is limited to JSON. Please review:. - general coding style; - packaging: Should these new files continue to live in RooStats, or should they go to a new subpackage of RooFit?; - code placement: Is the way I split the functionality up into different source files acceptable, or would you wish for a smaller/higher granularity of the splitting?; - build system: Is the way I encoded the optional dependency acceptable?; - class and function names: Are the names of classes and functions acceptable, or should things be renamed to be more conformant?. Please don't review yet:; - lack of functionality - more things will be added over time; - individual violations of the style guide (e.g. missing spaces or newlines) .

Integrability,"There are a number of trivial operations that users often want to perform on dataframes that are surprisingly hard to get right, for example adding several `Define`s in a loop or conditionally adding a `Filter` depending on a runtime boolean (both use-cases are challenging in C++, trivial in python). The way I see it, difficulties boil down to the fact that different dataframe nodes have different types (because their types incorporate e.g. the type of the callable passed to a `Filter` and the type of their parent node in the computation graph). In this PR I propose to add a common base class `ROOT::RDF::RNode` to all nodes of the graph (except leaves a.k.a results, which have a completely different interface),; so that users can, for example:; * take any dataframe node by reference in non-template functions as `RNode&`; * `emplace_back` dataframe nodes in ~`std::vector<RNode>`~ `vector<RInterface<RNode>>`; * have non-const pointers to dataframe nodes. and so on. For example, conditionally adding a `Range` do a dataframe now looks like this:. ```c++; auto maybe_ranged = [&df, mustAddRange] { ; return mustAddRange ? ROOT::RDF::RNode(d.Range(1)); : ROOT::RDF::RNode(d); ; }(); ; ```. while before this PR one would have to add fake `Filter(""true"")` filters to normalize the return type of the lambda, involving the interpreter for no reason. Internal `RDataFrame` code is also simplified by the introduction of this common base class.; The only downside I can think of is that if this mechanism is abused users might end up with extra, unnecessary virtual calls in their event loop -- on the other hand, this mechanism should only be used in situations that required either complex template magic or dirty and slow tricks before. Questions:; * can we come up with a better name than `ROOT::RDF::ToCommonNodeType` for the function that upcasts any dataframe object to the same type?; * should this cast only be explicit through an upcasting function call or should we allow implicit cas",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2182:211,depend,depending,211,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2182,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['depending', 'interface']"

Integrability,"This PR adds a first iteration of snapshotting to RNTuple from an RDataFrame. It uses the existing `Snapshot` interface, with an addition to `RSnapshotOptions`, `kOutputFormat`. This option can be set to write to either TTree, RNTuple, or take the default choice. The table below describes how `Snapshot` behaves accoring to the output format option:; | | From TTree | From RNTuple | From other DS |; | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |; | **To TTree** | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kTTree` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` |; | **To RNTuple** | Not yet possible, will be added in a follow-up, using functionality from `RNTupleImporter` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kRNTuple` |. ## Implementation; As mentioned, the existing `Snapshot` interface is used. A new `SnapshotRNTupleHelper` has been created to handle the creation and writing of the RNTuple, akin to the existing `SnapshotHelper` (which has been renamed to `SnapshotTTreeHelper` for consistency). ### RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f); The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. ### Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02); For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`. To avoid dependency conflicts related to including `ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx`, the free `FromRNTuple` functions have been moved to a separate header. ## Current limitations and follow-ups; This PR adds the minimal functionality for (single-threaded) snapshotting to RNTuple.

Integrability,"This PR adds a new data source for `RDataFrame` that is able to provide data from SQlite `SELECT` queries. It will be useful for cvmfs, where we have file catalogs and monitoring information in sqlite files. For instance, one can do. auto rdf = ROOT::RDF::MakeSqliteDataFrame(""catalog.sqlite"", ""select * from catalog"");; auto h = rdf.Define(""lname"", ""name.length()"").Histo1D(""lname"");. to show the distribution of file name sizes. There are probably more use cases, for instance sqlite export of conditions data. This is work in progress, I'm posting it for early comments and feedback. My open points are. - Unit and integration tests are yet to be done; - The data source work single-threaded only at the moment. I initially thought it might be enough to return only a single row in `GetEntryRanges()` to make it thread-safe but that's apparently not enough. So I'm now thinking to wrap `SetEntry()` and `GetEntryRanges()` in a mutex.; - The code is not reusing `TSQLiteServer`. It felt like it requires stretching the `TSQLServer` interface in perhaps unwanted ways, for saving only a handful of direct sqlite API calls. On the other hand, with (probably quite a bit) more work it might be possible to have a more general data source that works on any SQL result set.; - Determining column types in SQlite is tricky as it is dynamically typed and in principle each row can have different column types. If a table column is queried as is, I can use the default/declared column type. For expressions, I'll use the type of the first row of the result set.

Integrability,"This PR adds support for defining, parsing and generating code for custom operator in TMVA SOFIE. SOFIE is being developed following the ONNX standards, but cases may arise when a particular operator is not defined or developed. In those scenarios, an user can still integrate the operator using the custom operator implementation. . For adding a custom operator in `RModel`, the user has to define the input tensor names, output tensor names, attribute values, output tensor shapes and a header file name. The `Generate()` function for the custom operator must be defined in a separate header file under a namespace, which is called for computing the output tensor values. . ## Checklist:; - [x] `ROperator_Custom` class; - [x] Including usage in generated code; - [x] Tests for ROperator_Custom operator; - [ ] Tutorials explaining the usage",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11065:267,integrat,integrate,267,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11065,1,['integrat'],['integrate']
Integrability,"This PR adds to RooFit:. 1. Parallelism to gradient calculation in Minuit2 minimization in the form of a extensible interface in the RooFit::MultiProcess package.; 2. A refactored test statistics framework with cleaner separation of computation and physics/statistics concepts than in existing RooAbsTestStatistic derived classes. Currently, RooFit::TestStatistics is part of roofitcore. Note: `TestStatistics/likelihood_builders` still has to be finished, this will be done in the coming few weeks.; 3. RooFitZMQ, a wrapper of ZeroMQ functionality used in RooFit::MultiProcess for communication between processes. Modified after [code](https://gitlab.cern.ch/raaij/generate_and_sort/-/tree/master/ZMQ), contributed by @roelaaij. RooFitZMQ maybe still needs some attention, because in its current form it includes a big part of the libzmq source tree (needed for ppoll, see below), which I'm sure causes licensing issues (it's LGPLv3). I'm open to suggestions on how to handle this. To make the above additions possible, some modifications to both RooFit and non-RooFit code were made as well:. 1. In `Minuit2`:; 1. We added a subclass of the AnalyticalGradientCalculator called the ExternalInternalGradientCalculator. Whereas the AGC assumes that the gradient that is passed to it (from outside of Minuit2) is in normal parameter space, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2. To make this all work, we also had to upgrade precision of the transformation",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294:116,interface,interface,116,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294,2,"['interface', 'wrap']","['interface', 'wrapper']"

Integrability,This PR is a WIP for implementing dictionary reusing within a branch in ZSTD. The work is based on previous work of Brian for the Compression Engine although it does not make use of any of the functions associated with training. This work depends on: https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3947. Two extra file are added (ZSTDEngine2.hxx/cxx) that provide the infrastructure to perform a detailed analysis of the compression and decompression at basket level.

Integrability,"This PR is a do-over of #8385 and #8412 and, as such, again the second part of a split and clean-up of #8294. The most important blocker in those PRs was the inclusion of a patched libzmq in RooFitZMQ itself. [This patch has now been included in libzmq proper](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4255). Another blocking review comment was that libzmq symbols must not be allowed to be exported through our libraries. [This has been solved in theory, and in practice is pending another PR to libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4266). Having fixed these two blockers, we should now be able to continue. To recap:. > In this PR, we introduce two packages: RooFitZMQ and RooFit::MultiProcess. It also adds two builtins for ZeroMQ to ease dependency management: libzmq and cppzmq. The builtin for libzmq is especially necessary at this point because it has recently gained a necessary feature that has not been released yet.; > ; > RooFit::MultiProcess is a task-based parallelization framework.; > ; > It uses forked processes for parallelization, as opposed to threads. We chose this approach because A) the existing RooRealMPFE parallelization framework already made use of forks as well, so we had something to build on and B) it was at the time deemed infeasible to check the entire RooFit code for thread-safety.

Integrability,"This PR makes it easier to construct valid `RFieldDescriptors`. **Edit:** The initial version of this PR removed the move-only semantics on field descriptors. Instead, I added a `Clone` method for field descriptors. . <details>; <summary>Discarded rationale for reintroducing copy constructor for field descriptors</summary>; <br>; We wanted to be able to iterate over `FieldDescriptors` in alphabetical order by name, this is implemented in a3a3da6 using a layer of indirection, namely a vector of offsets `RFieldDescriptorRange::fOffsets`. ; I decided on making this an optional adapter method `SortByNames` instead of the default ordering, because it turns out iterating over `FieldDescriptors` is used elsewhere in the code (see improvements in API client code in 222a412). It also removes move-only semantics on `RFieldDescriptor` (my eventual intent is to remove move-only semantics on all `Descriptors`). `RFieldDescriptor` is made up of value-types only, so there are no resources to worry about. . For merging `NTuples`, we need to copy many descriptors (possibly with some small adjustments). ; With move-only semantics, we'd have to implement a `Clone` method for `RFieldDescriptor`. ; This is disadvantageous compared to relying on value semantics. `Clone`, while conceptually simple, is additional code to maintain.; * If we ever add fields to the class, Clone could be buggy (missing the added field); In contrast, the copy constructor will never miss any fields. ; * Move-only object lifetimes are non-trivial to reason about, we increase the risk of introducing UB by relying on a moved-from object, etc. . Regarding performance concerns (`RFieldDescriptor` has a vector member), I think C++ helps us here with Return Value Optimization and copy elision (simplified example here: https://godbolt.org/z/FwmKaD). .

As a consequence, `TCustomColumn` nodes are not required to be in the functional graph anymore (their function was to signal the point where a certain column name became valid), allowing simplifications of the graph traversing that TDF does during the event loop (e.g. to check all filters in a functional chain). `Define` now returns the same type as the node it was called on rather than `TInterface<TCustomColumn<Fun, PrevNode>>`.

Integrability,"This Pull Request adds more speaking information to users to make warnings of the type; `delgam < 0 : first derivatives increasing along search line`; useful. Note that I do not have too much knowledge on the details of Minuit2, and the information messages of course reflect my state of knowledge. If someone else with more in-depth knowledge on Minuit2 could check that this is valid, that would of course be very valuable!. The motivation for this PR is that these warnings can hint to significant issues in the minimized function, however as a user, it is difficult to understand the problem or what to look for if one does not know how Minuit exactly works. Also they so far miss information needed to actually use these warnings to find problems with the minimized function. This commit adds explanatory text printed in loglevel `Info`, and a short discovery note in the old warnings. To demonstrate why this warning + info with the new `s0` and `p1` information is useful, this is an example where I encountered them in the wild and used its newly printed `s0` and `p1` information to plot the function between `s0` and `p1`, pointing to an issue in the likelihood function I use:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31772910/199365936-6994973a-8946-4083-b1b9-da2f4f69cc6f.png).

The implemented method modifies the default behavior for committing page ranges, i.e. calling `::CommitSealedPage` repeatedly for each individual page. ; Instead, it coalesces the buffered page ranges - e.g. all pages in a column or cluster - into a batch of vector writes, enabling I/O parallelization after recent optimizations to the `RDaos` library. . As with the batched fetching case in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()`, the page write requests are aggregated by the pair (Object ID, Distribution Key). This pair is part of the `RDaosKey` determined by the mapping strategy set in `kDefaultDaosMapping` from the pages metadata and the `RPageSinkDaos` instance's atomic counter `fPageId` that uniquely identifies pages in the storage sink. ## Changes or fixes:. * Implements `std::vector<RNTupleLocator> RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl(std::span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges)`; * Modifies the default behavior in `RPageSink::CommitSealedPageV()` to coalesce pages before sending out the write request to storage; * Enables optimized (i.e. batched) vector write requests of multiple pages within a column range by exploiting the refactored `RDaos` interface and the generalized ntuple-object mappings in `RPageStorageDaos`. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally and on openlab cluster `olsky-03` with DAOS 2.0.x; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

The following features are part of the design:. * Full featured CMake build, based on https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2; - Only requires CMake 3.1+; - Support for adding as a subdirectory, using from build directory, or installing; - Works inside of ROOT or standalone; - Support for CPack binary `make package`; - Options for MPI and OpenMP integrated with main ROOT build; - Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows; - Version captured from ROOT; - CTest support; - `make docs` support (CMake 3.8+ only); * No need for extra ""prepare"" shell scripts, everything is done cross-platform through CMake and CPack; - Files can be copied in to make redistributable source with `-Dminuit2-standalone=ON`; - `make package_source` on Unix creates `.tar.gz` and `.zip` files (non-binary CPack); - `make purge` can remove copied files; * Helpful `README.md` and `DEVELOP.md` files. ### To produce a source distribution:; Make sure you have CMake 3.1+ (ROOT requires 3.4.3+, so that's likely).

Integrability,"This commit introduces an alias for raw pointers for indicating that the return type of a RooFit function is an owning pointer that must be deleted by the caller. For RooFit developers, it can be very useful to make this an alias to `std::unique_ptr<T>`, in order to check that your code has no memory problems. Changing this alias is equivalent to forcing all code immediately wraps the result of functions returning a `RooFit::OwningPtr<T>` in a `std::unique_ptr<T>`. The two fundamental RooFit functions `RooAbsArg::getVariables()` and `RooAbsArg::getParameters()` are also migrated to this new alias, and I tried to recompile ROOT locally using the `std::unique_ptr<T>` alias. This commit includes also the necessary changes to make ROOT compile with both raw and smart pointer alias, always wrapping the result of these functions in `std::unique_ptr<RooArgSet>`. There are many benefits of this alias, and my ultimate goal here is to eventually make PyROOT aware of it to always take ownership of the referenced objects. But it's also a great tool for developers to check that there are no memory issues in RooFit code.

Integrability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable. It was verified with flamegraphs that the performance of the likelihood creation for the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton model is now again identical to the state before commit 47c250898f3.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11619:454,depend,depend,454,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11619,2,"['depend', 'integrat']","['depend', 'integration']"

So an abstraction; didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics; to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library; are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor; macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`.

In; particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the; same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`; pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,; and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function; should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`; directly. This parameter is removed.

Integrability,"This issue is very case-dependent.; When trying to calculate memory usage, normally the actual free memory on the system is `free + buffer + cached `. If shared memory usage is high (e.g mmaping a big cache) the calculation is slightly different:; `(free + buffer/cache) - shared`. The author of **htop** mentions on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55090900/how-can-i-calculate-memory-utilisation-of-a-linux-server-using-sar-report) question that htop uses this convention(in 2016):. - Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree; - Non cache/buffer memory = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory). Now htop (managed by htop-dev) uses this (on https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/linux/LinuxMachine.c#L210):. ```; const memory_t usedDiff = freeMem + cachedMem + sreclaimableMem + buffersMem;; host->usedMem = (totalMem >= usedDiff) ? totalMem - usedDiff : totalMem - freeMem;; ```. This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution.

Integrability,"This patch was found by at least 3 different people. For example, I found it using the ""perf"" tool (if I remeber correctly, it was using gcc 4.8.4 back then and added -fno-omit-frame-pointer for compilation). The improvement of course depends on the settings. I don't understand why it takes so long to accept this patch. It is obviously correct - since if you use dynamic_cast and then do NOT check for nullptr and happily dereference the result, you can as well use a static_cast - if the old code was correct, the new one is correct as well. And the other cases, where you can simply remove the cast, are obvioulsly correct as well. By the way, I am still waiting for the invitation for a meeting in -1 month, as was announced here: https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=22880 - and please please consider my patches there as well. At least give feedback. This one with the casts is by far the easiest patch.

Integrability,"This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library.

These classes specify a ""collection proxy"" that provides access to the elements in the collection.; A legacy collection proxy is provided in the form of an instance of a class derived from `TVirtualCollectionProxy`. The collection proxy for a class is typically set during initialization, usually using `TClass::CopyCollectionProxy()` or similar.

Integrability,"This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in #8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local.; Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`.

Integrability,"This should be the last crop of fixes needed by ROOT-10216. In brief, the changes are to replace lookup by simpler search to avoid nested; initialization of TClasses (leading to the outer nested initialization; to end using deleted memory).

With. ```; namespace User {; class TrackerVtxBase; class BeamFlux : public User::TrackerVtxBase; class NTrackerVtx : public User::BeamFlux; }; ```.

Solution: replace raw pointer by a TClassRef.

Integrability,"This somewhat huge commit mainly demotes many class-versions to 0. . If wanted, I can for sure squash some things (right now, the commit messages contain the underlying reasoning). . In ROOT, a lot of classes were equipped with class-versions > 0 even though they are not meant for IO / streaming. ; This produces unnecessary overhead (creation of Streamer() functions) and might be misleading for users (especially if they believe streaming of these classes would be ok and then lose parts of their data). That's even more helpful when testing framework's dataobject-code. . These classes were identified by https://github.com/olifre/rootStaticAnalyzer (a new project still in early stages) and I have created this PR to fix almost all these issues. . The last commit in the series also explicitly marks two members (of TSeqCollection and THashList) as transient, even though these classes are already class-version 0. This is purely to make it more explicit that these are not streamed - and allow for programmatic testing (since then the `kTransient` bit of the `TRealData` will be set correctly). . Several issues alerted by `rootStaticAnalyzer` still remain which are probably real bugs in ROOT 6. . Examples: . ```; TMVA/PDF.h:0: error: Data object class 'TMVA::PDF' will not stream the following indirect members: members 'fConfigName, fConfigDescription, fReferenceFile' from class 'TMVA::Configurable' (class-version 0)!; ```.

Integrability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:981,rout,routines,981,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,2,"['Interface', 'rout']","['Interfaces', 'routines']"

Integrability,"True` as optional argument. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float"", numba_only=True); def f(x); return 2.0 * x; ```. In addition, you can set a `verbose` flag to let PyROOT tell you if the decorator falls back to the generic implementation. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""string"", verbose=True); def f(x); return ROOT.std.string(str(x)). ROOT.CppCallable.f(x); # 1) Throws Python warning:; # /home/stefan/foo.py:5: RuntimeWarning: Failed to compile Python callable using numba. Fall back to generic implementation.; # @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""string"", verbose=True); # 2) Falls back to generic impl and prints ""42"" (as string); ```. **DEPRECATED:**. I've cleaned up and improved the feature. Here's the basic workflow now:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float""); def f(x); return 2.0 * x. # General use-cases; ROOT.ROOT.f(21) # Returns 42; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << ROOT::f(21.0) << endl;"") # Prints 42.0. # Inject callable into dataframe; df = ROOT.ROOT.RDataFrame(10).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry__"").Define(""ROOT::f(x)""); ```. The `DeclareCallable` dispatches between numba and the generic implementation. It tries to compile the thingy with numba (falls through silently) and otherwise tries the generic implementation (fails noisily).; However, you can force using the generic implementation or numba by using the decorators `DeclareGenericCallable` and `DeclareNumbaCallable`. The interface is exactly the same than for the general `DeclareCallable` decorator. In addition, you can now give the wrapped function a custom name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++.

The initial patch does not work since the `fOutputFile` member of `TFileMerger` is not a derivate of `TMemFile` and is the one that is getting changed in the process. The design of `TFileMerger` is of using `fOutputFile` as the file where all the data is merged, so of course it should never be deleted.

We can also return a `std::vector<std::string>` here. I already talked with @Zeff020 about this change, and he is completely fine with it. The class was also only used by the RooFit Multiprocess developers so far, so changing the interface is fine.

Integrability,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

As concrete example, if one needed to implement a PDF such as `f(x) = a/x + b*x + c`, it feels like we should be able to do; ```c; // Define custom pdf; RooGenericPdf my_pdf(""my_pdf"", ""x[1]/x[0] + x[2]*x[0] + x[3]"", RooArgList(x, a, b, c));; // Set formula for analytical integral; my_pdf.SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula(""x[1]*TMath::Log(x[0]) + x[2]*x[0]*x[0]/2 + x[0]*x[3]"");; ```. This would be implemented in such way that just creating an `RooGenericPdf` object would set it to numerical integration by default, and then calling `SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula()` would make it use analytical integration based on the supplied formula.

If they are unused in the remaining file and not part of the public interface, why not remove them?; - [x] There is an [unreachable code branch here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/1608dfa0d8d630617d6b529ccb090a0bbab00bbc/roofit/roofit/src/RooLagrangianMorphFunc.cxx#L1905). The `setup()` function is called in the class constructor when `_diagrams` is still empty. So the `diagrams.size() > 0` check will never be true and the if-block can be removed, no?; - [x] The [`_nonInterferig`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/1608dfa0d8d630617d6b529ccb090a0bbab00bbc/roofit/roofit/inc/RooLagrangianMorphFunc.h#L266) data member is used in a few member functions, but it is never filled so always an empty vector. How meaningful is that? Can `_nonInterfering` be removed? ; - [x] It's annoying to have all these explicit usage of `this`, just to access a class member that is already marked as a class member with the underscore prefix convention. Please replace all occurences of `this->_` in the source file with just `_`.; - [x] [`makeCrosssectionContainer()`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/1608dfa0d8d630617d6b529ccb090a0bbab00bbc/roofit/roofit/src/RooLagrangianMorphFunc.cxx#L2128) returns a `TPair*` that is owned by the caller. Please return `std::unique_ptr<TPair>` is this case, or even better return a `std::pair` instead (avoid using old ROOT container classes that were written before the standard library was introduced).; - [x] Similarly, [`createTH1`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/1608dfa0d8d630617d6b529cc",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9845:510,interface,interface,510,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9845,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"While testing my packages which use PyROOT, I stumbled across a little problem with ROOT and pytest which I propose to fix. Assume you have this very minimal (basically empty) python package:; ```; .; ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py; ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests; ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_test.py. 1 directory, 2 files; ```; Content of `setup.py`:; ```python; from setuptools import setup, find_packages. setup(; name=""root_cleanup_test"",; packages=find_packages(),; setup_requires=[""pytest-runner""],; test_suite=""tests"",; ); ```; Content of `test_test.py`; ```; import unittest; import ROOT. class TestTest(unittest.TestCase):; def test_test(self):; pass; ```. Now if you run the tests with `python setup.py pytest` which gives you the warning and error I attach to the bottom of this post. I think this is maybe related to some multithreading in the pytest runner. When you run the test alone with `pytest tests/test_test.py`, you won't get the error. My setup: ROOT 6.16/00 and Python 3.7. Let me know if I can do anything else to test this!

However, this is what the program above outputs in ROOT master:; ```; 1; 0.493; 1; 0.164333; ```. The first 3 integrals are correct, but the final one (custom range for x and slice of y) gives the wrong result (0.493 expected).

Integrability,"With PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12800, the `RooFormula` was taken out of the public user; interface, because it is an implementation detail of the RooFormulaVar; and RooGenericPdf. However, there are cases where people used the RooFormula interface to; access some information that was otherwise unavailable, like the set of; actual variables that the formula depends on. There is some code in RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf that makes it seem; like these classes provide an interface to the actual variables; themselves:. ```c++; const RooArgList& dependents() const { return _actualVars; }; ... RooListProxy _actualVars ; ///< Actual parameters used by formula engine; ```. However, `_actualVars` is containing **all** variables, not the actual; variables as the name suggests!. Fixing this removes the need to access the actual vars via the; `RooFormula`. This connects to a discussion that was held on GitHub:; https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/a470a3d85e8b5c93917d3e84c39e9d5f0066da97#commitcomment-113514331.

Integrability,"With `RNTupleWriter::Append` / `RNTupleParallelWriter::Append`, the application must organize synchronization to the underlying `TFile`. To avoid locking for every `Fill`, https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15239 introduced `FillNoCommit` and gives some guarantees so that locking is only necessary when calling `CommitCluster`. However that's still not ideal because `CommitCluster` will first call `CommitCluster` on every field, which will flush the column write buffers and trigger compression. This can be substantial for many fields or very large page sizes (compared to the cluster size). Ideally a `RNTupleFillContext` had a method to perform this work outside of the critical section, like `PrepareCommitCluster` or `FlushPageBuffers`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16241:94,synchroniz,synchronization,94,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16241,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronization']

Integrability,"With master (commit 7f3f3428e4d20) (but has been present for a long time), PyROOT overload resolution of function that takes an enum class is unstable (it appears to depend on the value rather than the type).

ROOT.gSystem.Load(""enums_cxx""). h = ROOT.Holder(); for i in range(10, 0, -1):; h.SetTwo(i); ROOT.to_string(h.two); ```; gives; ```txt; Calling to_string for enum EOne with 0; Calling to_string for enum EOne with 1; ...; ```.

Integrability,"With multiple concurrent `RNTupleFillContext`s, the order of clusters is generally indeterminate and entries are only partially ordered. With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:; 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context.; 2. When appropriate for the application, all staged clusters can be committed, which logically appends them to the RNTuple. This is implemented in a single critical section, which guarantees that the clusters and their entries are consecutive. Moreover, by synchronizing the second phase between multiple contexts, the application can enforce a total ordering of all contained entries at reasonable resource consumption: During the first phase, all write buffers are flushed and will be reused for the following cluster. The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets. The impact resulting from this will depend on the storage technology and the read pattern.

Integrability,"With this change, fields are only added to the `REntry` and read when they are referenced in the processor loop. This prevents unecessary reads of unused fields. It also makes the REntry completely transparent from an interface perspective. Pointers to values can be obtained through the processor interface itself *before* the iteration starts, or alternatively via the iterator returned by the processor. Important to note that during iteration, the pointer returned by `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` will **not** contain the value for the current entry. The reason for this is that from the `RNTupleProcessor` interface there is (with the current implementation) no way to know what the current entry index is. For now, `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` contains a warning and a recommendation to get the pointer through the iterator instead. Alternative solutions could be:; 1. Remove `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` altogether and only allow access to the field value pointers through the iterator.; 2.

Integrability,"With very few entries passing a given RDataFrame cutflow, it can happen; that a TBB task ends up processing zero ""good"" entries.; In that scenario, it could happen that the first TTree header flushed to; the output file from a Snapshot action was for a tree with no entries and; no branches. This effectively set the number of branches to; zero for all the content written to file, even if following buffers; contained well-formed TTrees. With this commit, if the output tree contains zero entries, we avoid; flushing it to file. And since the next task will remove this TTree from; the output directory, we can be sure that the buffer with the malformed; TTree will never be written out. This fixes ROOT-9471. <hr>. The fix requires that output trees are deregistered from output directories at the end of a task, so that the output directory does not ever try to flush them. This is done by giving `SnapshotHelperMT` ownership of its output trees (see explanation in the relevant commit message).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197:989,message,message,989,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197,1,['message'],['message']
Integrability,"Without a better place to put this (should I open a follow-up issue?):. > 1. Try to reproduce the problem with vanilla lli of LLVM 9 to check that this is not related to the way Cling incrementally JITs and executes.

But it's Philippe's review, I let him comment / deal with this if you still prefer to keep your current commit log.

Integrability,"You are adding it to the target, the dependency is explicit in the fact that you need to have a target to pass as argument. You don't need to add the include that the dictionary needs to the executable, you could just add it to the directory includes, but adding to the target is better as it avoids leaking it to subdirectories. You only have to do it before because of Axel's changes that force a manual header search for the dictionary header, so the search paths need to be ready for you to actually find it. In earlier versions of ROOT, not finding this header would not cause a failure, but may have picked up the wrong header and injected a bunch of absolute paths to the dictionary which in turn would end up breaking things. For example, if you know the dictionary header will always just be in the current source directory, you could just set `CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR` to `True` instead, and not add the current directory to the target includes.; ```; $ cmake --help-variable CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; -------------------------.

Integrability,"You probably guessed it already - but the issue is that derived classes use `TFile`'s public constructors, too, and so while the purpose of derived classes is to handle remote protocols, `TFile`'s constructors will nonetheless be called with such a ""filename"". Yes - that's not super well designed (we should have had a common base class, and TFile should be an incarnation of those, not be the common base itself), but we cannot change that at this point. As this is in the ctor you cannot even check ""am I really a `TFile` or a derived class?` because the object's vtable isn't populated enough yet, and thus a runtime-type-info ""who are you?"" will just say ""`TFile`!"" even for derived classes.

Integrability,"[EDIT]: 2017-07-20 dropped commit (6953483). See the commit messages for detailed descriptions of the changes. In essence, when comparing some data with the KolmogorovTest an infinite loop was triggered. (bba95dd) We want to get an approximate solution to the test despite there being some bins with neg. content; (06024c8) To prevent the infinite loop in other cases, calling FillRandom with a histogram with negative content is now an error.; (6953483) The caching inside GetRandom can violate an invariant of the function. (Always return NaN when there is a bin with neg. content in the source histogram). [EDIT] Removed after discussion with Lorenzo. The recomputation of the integral here was deemed too expensive as the function is intended to be called in tight loops.

This was not caught during testing because we test on recent compilers with a C++17-compatible STL implementation, where if you see some overloads of `std::abs`, you see all of them. By switching to `std::fabs` in addition to fixing the include, I guarantee that if this happens again during an overeager include cleanup, the compiler error message will be clearer. Old compilers will now complain about a missing declaration of `std::fabs`, rather than a failed overload resolution of integer `std::abs`.

This causes that a wrong error is used when fitting.; See https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/tgraphmultierrors-fitting/47807. To reproduce: ; ```; TGraphMultiErrors g;; g.AddPoint(2,3);; double e1[1] = {1};; double e2[1] = {3}; ; g.AddYError(1, e1, e1);; g.AddYError(1, e2, e2); ; std::cout << g.GetEYlow()[0] << std::endl;; ```.

Integrability,"[pr.log](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/14873477/pr.log); This pull request changes the behavior of the create and recreate functions of the `TFile` class. When a new ROOT file is created, the underlying path may not exist. This commit modifies the logic of `TFile.cxx` such that the underlying path is explicitly created. It works only if `TFile.cxx` is compiled with the C++17 standard, otherwise the relevant code is excluded by the means of the preprocessor. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary). ## Quick test; I prepared a small program in C++ (requires C++17) to quickly test the pull request (see at the bottom of the message). In log, with the patched ROOT version the output looks like thit:; ```; Attempt to (re)createa/b/c/test.root; Ok.; ```; while with the ROOT version 6.28 the output looks like this:; ```; Attempt to (re)createa/b/c/test.root; SysError in <TFile::TFile>: file XXXXXX/ftest/XXYqNIoC/a/b/c/test.root can not be opened No such file or directory; Fail.; ```.

That means, the direct value server `par_mod` is **skipped** now,; misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the; `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it; wrong. That's why this commit suggests to change the logic in `RooRealIntegral`; to always add the next direct value servers that don't depend on the; integration variable, and not the leaves. A unit test that verifies that the value servers of the integral are the; mathematically direct value servers and not the computation graph leaves; is also implemented. Closes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578. The PR also fixes the same problem for the RooProjectedPdf, which is essentially a integral wrapper but it also got the server-client interface wrong.

This alternative design has two main advantages:; - it simplifies `RAction` greatly, removing the need for the special; `RTypeErasedColumnReader` type: now all column readers are type erased; in the sense that a `RColumnReaderBase*` does not contain the type of; the column that will be read; - it makes it possible to pass `RColumnReaderBase` through interfaces; that type-erase column types, which is important to better integrate; RDF and RDataSource: in the future, `RDataSource` implementations will; be able to return specialized column readers to RDF rather than raw; pointers to the datasource values. There should be no visible difference in event loop runtimes: a virtual; call to `SomeColumnReader<T>::Get` has been substituted with a direct,; inlined call to `RColumnReaderBase::Get<T>` which in turn executes a; virtual call to `SomeColumnReader<T>::GetImpl`.

For `RMergeableVariations<T>`, the data member `fValues` is a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RMergeableValue<T>>>` (due to the way we need to retrieve the various mergeables of the variations in the call chain). So it seemed quite natural to me to have a ; ```cpp; const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RMergeableValue<T>>> &GetValue() const { return fValues; }; ```; method in this class to me (albeit I failed to mark the method itself `const`). Having a ; ```cpp; const T &GetValue(const std::string &variation) const;; ```; method is also possible.

Integrability,"`RooLinkedList::At(ix)` was implemented using an `ix`-step walk through the list. We found that in HistFactory models, `At` was used to loop over the list, which thus caused a lot of double walking through the list. This PR (a cherry-pick from the [roofit-dev fork](https://github.com/roofit-dev/root/tree/linked_list_at)) improves this situation by replacing `At`'s walk by a direct lookup from a `std::vector` of `RooLinkedListElem` pointers. In our HistFactory-based benchmark, this gave a significant speed boost of 1.6x on a likelihood minimization task. Since this was not the focus of the roofit-dev project, unfortunately, I had no time yet to wrap up this feature into a nice PR, do rigorous testing and benchmarking, etcetera. I would appreciate reviews and suggestions or additional commits for improvements. For instance, I put `//!` behind the index vector (the name of this `//!` feature currently eludes me), so I wouldn't have to update the class version, but I guess this will break the class when it is (de)serialized.

Integrability,"`from ROOT import *` leads to a segmentation violation when used with Python 3.6. One could try fixing it instead of disabling it but the code which is used to install the lookup handler in the module `RootModule::SetRootLazyLookup` depends on internal CPython implementation details of the dict class which are not part of the public API. As a consequence keeping this alive will lead to very; fragile code, require continuous effort to adapt to internal changes and cause a lot of #ifdef handling. (as a matter of fact, Python 3.7 would probably already require new changes to this code already). . Also there's a statement in the bug report that `from ROOT import *` is broken in Python 3 so I don't understand why it's not disabled as it will only confuse users: https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8931.

Integrability,"`gInterpreter::ProcessLine` has an important run-time cost.; Instead of calling it everytime the jitting of an action is required, we now store all the strings that are to jit in TLoopManager and do a single call to `gInterpreter::ProcessLine` before running the event-loop. A couple of life-time issues had to be resolved for this to work properly: in order to let result proxies and action helpers share ownership of the result object, I introduced (simple) manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr (weird, I know). In order to deal with deferred jitting of an action that hangs from a node whose `TInterface` has already been destroyed (can happen due to the deferral of jitting) all `BuildAndBook` functions have been made independent of `TInterface`. In the long term it might be possible to refactor the jitting mechanism so that the `TAction` (and the `TTreeReaderValue/Array`s that it contains) is jitted but the action helpers are not, lifting the requirement of manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr. Although this should be possible in principle, I currently don't see how we could integrate it with the existing logic, so I decided for this much less invasive solution. Before/after runtimes for two extreme scenarios:. `test_inference.cxx` (which performs a lot of jitting).; compile time: ~8s -> ~9s; run time: ~40s -> ~7s. 50 jitted Histo1D calls in a loop (thanks to Attila for the use-case):; run time: ~35s -> <2s.

Integrability,"al read is modeled as an error. This would require `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` to force the ""immediate exception"" state to a certain value and reset it later - which is error prone and awkward; it shows that we use a global state that needs local knowledge. If ""immediate exception"" is false and `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` captures the error and returns it, same for all subsequent frames but `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` (which cannot return a `RStatus`), then only `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` will throw. This would shorten the stack trace shown by a potential crash to; ```; ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++(); UserCode::modelBackground(); ```; - we would not know the stack trace that actually triggered the exception. We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime library implementations (but ABI break). **TL;DR**:; I agree that exceptions instead of error codes allow for nicer code. I don't think that we can have that nice code when we introduce `RStatus`, because the developer of that code m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730:1598,inject,injecting,1598,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730,1,['inject'],['injecting']

Integrability,"allable using numba. Fall back to generic implementation.; # @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""string"", verbose=True); # 2) Falls back to generic impl and prints ""42"" (as string); ```. **DEPRECATED:**. I've cleaned up and improved the feature. Here's the basic workflow now:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float""); def f(x); return 2.0 * x. # General use-cases; ROOT.ROOT.f(21) # Returns 42; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << ROOT::f(21.0) << endl;"") # Prints 42.0. # Inject callable into dataframe; df = ROOT.ROOT.RDataFrame(10).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry__"").Define(""ROOT::f(x)""); ```. The `DeclareCallable` dispatches between numba and the generic implementation. It tries to compile the thingy with numba (falls through silently) and otherwise tries the generic implementation (fails noisily).; However, you can force using the generic implementation or numba by using the decorators `DeclareGenericCallable` and `DeclareNumbaCallable`. The interface is exactly the same than for the general `DeclareCallable` decorator. In addition, you can now give the wrapped function a custom name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++. The mechanism builds with cling a C++ wrapper class around Python callables and publishs them to the user. See following example for the basic mechanism. ```python; import ROOT. # Because C++ is strongly typed, we have to declare the types of the inputs and the output; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float""); def func(x):; return 2.0 * x. print(func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; print(ROOT.PyROOT.func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << PyROOT::func(1.0) << endl;"") # Prints 2.0; ```. This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488:2214,interface,interface,2214,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"appen) In other words a portion of the new/delete problem has just been hidden under new with a different name. This is exactly what I mean by modern ownership models. In example 1 the top level code asked for memory that it owns. In my class version it made an instance that it owns. Objects are scoped only as far as requested. When that scope dies, or the container is reset, it's cleaned up where it is made. That's what smart pointers are all about. The PR as-is won't leak, but only because it's not flexible enough to create different things. It's a fragile grammar and in the end I'd rather worry about adding top-level ""keep"" statements than top level ""deletes"". In the C++ global version of example 2, to get the serial loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then. I wrote a script just like that this week exactly to fit a number of peaks determined by a file read inside one routine, and looped over outside, and I used example 1, not example 2, and future use of the base routine will never cause leaks. . The code structure is problematic to me. RDirectory itself isn't terrible, but I just don't see what it solves other than more syntax to remember. A final point, the shared pointers supposedly perform worse than unique pointers. I don't know how much it matters, but when you're fitting millions of waveforms maybe it does. Of course then you shouldn't be using RDirectory, but you can still use my_subroutines.C to do your fit if you're looping the million without RDirectory or to examining one of those fits with RDirectory, without rewriting the routine. I'm going to skip the point about empty root objects just to limit the scope for now. ### How to skip globals entirely. Of course you can just let the top level code return an object or structure. The downside is just that you have to .L the code and call it with auto ret=make_th1().

One existing model some applications I use are employing is:; * Create a `TRint` shortly after startup, passing in `argc` and `argv`. ; * Allow the user to drop to a ROOT interpreter prompt. This is then done by calling `app->Run(kTRUE);`. A user can use the interpreter to inspect state of the analysis software, and exit it again to let the software continue. . The latter approach is extremely useful for example to shell out after analysis software startup, or inside an event, such that the user can interactively analyze objects right from a ROOT interpreter shell. . ### Questions; * Is the use case ""use TRint as class to drop into the interpreter"" supported? ; The changelog of 6.26.00 reads like `TRint` is meant for internal use by `root.exe` only, but there seems to be no easy alternative. ; Depending on the reply, this could be a separate bug report, or a ""wontfix"". ; * If the use case is / should be supported, It would be useful to be able to allow unsupported arguments to pass through, for use in applications which are not `root.exe`. ; * For improved backwards compatibility and safety, not crashing when being passed `*argc = nullptr` and / or `argv = nullptr` would be nice. . In case somebody else is hit by this, I am right now using this hack as workaround:; ```cpp; int dargc = 1;; char** dargv = &argv[0];; myApp = new TRint(""myApp"", &dargc, dargv, nullptr, 0, kTRUE);; myApp->GetOptions(&argc, (argv));; gSystem->SetProgname(argv[0]);; ```; This allows to re-use the `TApplication` functionality as before, without triggering one of the two issues.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10090:1479,Depend,Depending,1479,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10090,1,['Depend'],['Depending']

Integrability,"arker style is influenced by the marker line width I added the function HasMarkerLineWidth to TAttMarker. **Marker size and draw method**; Since the calculation of the size of the marker assumed ultimatly thin lines up to now, the bounding box of the marker would have increased when setting a larger marker line width. To counter that, I decreased the marker size by the amount it would have increased due to the line width. However, note that this only works with round line caps and round line joins, since for example with miter joins the bounding box becomes infinitly large for infinitly small angles. This is also the reason why I decided to used round caps and round joins when drawing the marker lines in a TPad. However for the vector graphic export classes the line join method is set by gStyle->GetJoinLinePS(). Since there was no corresponding implementation for the line cap, I added it to TStyle. Furthermore, the line join method setting was ignored by the SVG export until now, so I decided to add it there as well. **Further changes**; Another thing I noted is that the markers 3 and 5 (and 31) were looking different depending on whether they were drawn by a class based on TVirtualPadPainter or based on TVirtualPS. Furthermore the behaviour for marker styles 9-19 were different between the implementations. (You can see the differences when you compare the canvas created by `TMarker::DisplayMarkerTypes()` with the marker style example picture in the class reference of TAttMarker.); I thought that the marker style definition used by classes based on TVirtualPadPainter seems better than the one by classes based on TVirtualPS. However, if you think that the definition of classes based on TVirtualPS is more correct, I can change this quickly but would then propose to also change definition in the TVirtualPadPainter classes since the markers should look the same everywhere.

Integrability,"arry term can make the small non-zero carry term disappear.; * Due to these changes and the earlier KahanSum updates, we were able to tighten the tolerance of tests in testLikelihoodSerial, testLikelihoodJob and testLikelihoodGradientJob, with many tests now passing EXPECT_EQ.; * testLikelihoodGradientJob adds offsetting to the parameterized test matrices of the LikelihoodGradientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets. At construction time within a MinuitFcnGrad, they get passed the same single offset object so that it is always kept synced between the different likelihood calculators. If it isn't synced and the likelihood gets different offsets at different times, the minimizer understandably gets very confused. This was the case before this commit, which was, in fact, a bug.; * For LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob, the offsets are also synchronized to all workers via update_state. For this, we simply check before evaluation whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger. Note that while the LikelihoodGradientJob doesn't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize offsets, because during the gradient calculation the LikelihoodSerial objects on the workers are used to calculate the likelihoods there, so for them the offsets must be up to date.; * The LikelihoodJob contains a LikelihoodSerial member as well now. This allows the LikelihoodJob to trigger calculating the offsets on the master process before sending them to the workers.; * LikelihoodWrapper has some added private helper functions for managing offsets. - Other miscellaneous changes:; * LikelihoodWrapper::setApplyWeightSquared was implemented properly for RooSumL likelihoods as well, passing along the call to component RooUnbinnedLs.

Integrability,"ast top-level expression's value is printed if missing trailing semicolon) should be kept for consistency and simplicity reasons.; > ; > Let's hear some other opinions here, e.g. @SimeonEhrig @jalopezg-uc3m @pcanal ?. I do realize my post was terse. Here is more text as the discussion went in another direction. Since early days, as you already mentioned, the rule seems to be ""the last expression without a trailing semicolon should print"". If that is the rule, then it clearly does not handle short-hand operators. Namely, `if (x) expr`. That rule does not extend to your examples `do 1 while(true)` as `while` is not really an user-defined expression. `if (x) { expr }` does not fall there either as it is in a compound statement. It is pretty clear where we stop. The construct `if(x) expr`, as shown in the example, enables an interactive programming pattern wrt error handling where in case of an error we can just ask cling to print details. > I'd prefer to keep value printing simple. The implementation of what I propose requires 2-3 lines [here](https://github.com/vgvassilev/cling/blob/856f8e92f82f9037b3dbb27ae7f94add2ed6121f/lib/Utils/AST.cpp#L141-L152). And actually makes the value printing rule more comprehensible. It took me some time to realize what's wrong and I implemented it, so I'd say it would be less comprehensible to other people. > and instead invest where it's relevant: devtoolset, debug symbols, llvm upgrade (to llvm 11!), etc. This is a trade-off we should consciously do, and given that this is the first time I hear a request for value printing within nested blocks . We have had that in the past. I do not think having not user requests should be an argument against this bug. > I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the effort (and yes, that's an additional counter argument). And I'm not just talking dev time but also long-term maintenance: more code, more clang interfaces used.

Integrability,"at uses LLVM.; > ; > Unfortunately, those should be carefully attended because of ROOT. I would feel more comfortable if my stack knows which libraries depend on LLVM to avoid pain debugging ROOT.; > ; Well, the problem is that this is no so easy to control. LLVM can come in from a dependency chain via many libraries like OpenCL / Vulkan / arrow. And I am afraid this will become more complicated in the future. Instead of messing with each of them, I thought it might be better to fix the issue in a single place on the ROOT side. > I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example.; > ; I agree, me neither. If we can find a better and cleaner way, I am absolutely in favor of that. > IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?; > ; All shared libraries must be compiled with -fPIC by definition, so libgandiva is already compiler with -fPIC. The change would only be for exectuables, which usually do not have -fPIC by default. But then actually other libraries have similar requirements, e.g. Qt5 (with -reduce-relocation flag, which is the default) requires all executables to link against Qt to be compiled with -fPIC. But again, if there is a better way, I am also in favor of avoiding -fPIC-. > This check is to protect the subsequent `dlsyms` in TCling to resolve symbols from the wrong place.

Notes. * Adding the `libtbb` installed by ROOT explicitly solves the problem.; * doing `ldd` on `libImt` prints the expected path for `libtbb`; * re-doing the failing link with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` containing the directory where the builtin `libtbb` is solved the problem; * redoing the failing link adding to `-Wl,-rpath-link,` the directory where the builtin `libtbb` is solved the problem ; * The main difference is that when linking `libImt` with builtin the link line uses `-ltbb` while when linking against an external `tbb` it list the full pathname of the library (while the ROOT library use a relative path). So the problem is might be either that; * we use `-ltbb` for the buitin; * the CMake fragment used by the dependent product does not add the ROOT library path to `rpath` (in contrast both Geant4 and VecGeom add their path to rpath or so it seems. ### Reproducer. build ROOT with buitin tbb; build Celeritas against that ROOT install. ### ROOT version. at least v6.28/04 and master. ### Installation method. hand build. ### Operating system. linux. ### Additional context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13079:2028,depend,dependent,2028,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13079,1,['depend'],['dependent']

I had to create an Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine for testing. . @lmoneta, unfortunately, this error happens because Ubuntu 16.04 ships GSL version 2.1, which hasn't gsl_ran_multivariate_gaussian. The multivariate Gaussian random number generation in GSL was only introduced in version 2.2.1. I bypass this with an `#ifdef` that will define the function if the GSL version is < 2.2 by simply copying it from a higher version of GSL. Hopefully, this doesn't break the GPL license under which GSL is distributed. I think that I could also replace the function call to `gsl_ran_multivariate_gaussian` with the wrapper's full implementation. I am open to comments.

Integrability,"ave anything to do with PROOF and TProofOutputFile, I thought I'd rather continue the discussion in a new thread. What I originally observed was that in the latest 5.34.XX version some of my PROOF jobs would return me an empty TTree, even though the job reported that it selected some events. For a while I was not able to find a handle on what triggered this problem, as it seemed quite random. (The same job would not always return empty trees.). I think I now understand what's going on. It has to do with the issue in TFileMerger that was discovered in ATLAS production jobs a long time ago. When TFileMerger is given multiple files, the first of which doesn't have any branches in it, the merged output file will not have any branches either. Even if the rest of the files given to TFileMerger did have some structure. In my PROOF jobs this happens because my code only sets up the format of its output TTree when it opens its first file. The output TTree format depends a bit on what branches are available on the input, so I can't do this any sooner. But PROOF in some cases will not process any events in some of its workers. When this happens, it's actually these workers that return their output files to the PROOF master first. Files which hold completely empty TTree-s. This made my jobs random, as PROOF would not always do this, sometimes (depending on the state of our cluster) it would actually process some events on all of the workers in this job. The problem can be demonstrated very easily. Attached is a macro that does this. (The macro was first written to demonstrate a problem with merging a file into a file on XRootD, but this issue doesn't depend on where the file is put.). While I may be able to circumvent the problem in my analysis code for now (by initializing the TTree format earlier in the code), this merging problem would be very good to solve. As I wrote at the beginning, the ATLAS production system also has to have extra code in place which knows not to give ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14558:1251,depend,depends,1251,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14558,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"ay. So, to your points:. No, it does not need to be instantiated first. For example, if I know that a _potential_ match has a signature of `T*`, then I'm not going to ask it to match `T&`, so even before instantiation, the lookup has useful information. Right now, CPyCppyy loops over each, so will eventually match if all types are by-pointer or all are by reference, but that fails combinations. Another good case is knowing which arguments are based on template parameters and which are not, so that the non-template ones need not be varied. No, on the Python side it is fair game to provide the template arguments, and thus non-ADL happens, too. E.g. all int types are equivalent as far as Python is concerned, and although CPyCppyy will increase the template int argument if it has an argument value larger than will fit, it is not uncommon for Python users to simply fill in `int64_t` or whatever. In fact, as-is, if the prototype lookup, ie. argument dependent, fails, CPyCppyy will assume that we're dealing with the common case where all argument types are template parameters. (It's a human thing to make that order consistent, which is why it works quite often, but it is not a language requirement/guarantee.) It then asks for the full name in a non-ADL manner. ROOT/meta (lookupHelper, I think) does not even support friends, so no worries there. Whether you think it is ""eeew"" or not is irrelevant. That's highly a technical term. What is relevant is that just before the lookupHelper does a `BestViableFunction()` it has a `OverloadCandidateSet` and I can do a much better job finding my own match than can do Sema, b/c the rules to apply aren't exactly the C++ ones (the only ones that Sema knows). Unfortunately, I can't just return the set, as it's deep in the bowels of lookupHelper, whose bowels are very deep if you ever looked, and AFAICT, there is a current transaction that needs to be returned with it and maybe more. Plus if returned, there also needs to be a cleanupHelper.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778:1182,depend,dependent,1182,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778,1,['depend'],['dependent']

So, it calls to StdLen, which apparently then crashes by branching to 0.; It's unfortunately difficult to then tell exactly why that happened.; FWIW, the registers at the crash were:. ```; rip: 0033:0000000000000000 eflags: 0000000000010202; rax: 00000000ffffffeb rbx: 0000000000000220; rcx: 0000000000000078 rdx: 0000000000000000; r08: ffffffffffffffff r09: 00007f68354af4d0; r10: 72543a3a444f4178 r11: 0000000000000006; r12: 00000000961170c0 r13: 00007f67e4395a90; r14: 0000000000000000 r15: 00007f683459fb22; rsi: 00000000961170c0 rdi: 000000000000001f; rbp: 00007f67e4395c28 rsp: 00007f67e4395a48; ```. However, the reason i'm writing this up here is that StdLen contains; a mutable, static std::set instance:. ```; static ShuttingDownSignaler<std::set<std::string>> gInlined;; ```. So this appears to be a thread-safety issue, regardless of whether; this is actually reponsible for the observed crash. There is no lock protecting this in either StdLen or in the TClass; methods that call it. There is a lock (gCoreMutex) taken in TClass::GetClass,; so we should be safe against other code that's using GetClass.; However, ATLAS code also directly uses TClassEdit in a number of places,; so i think we do have a potential race.

Integrability,"back port of https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863. This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library. This 2 changes fix #12715. The commit [TClassTable: Remove alternate names upon library unloading.](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863/commits/17e8833ec3deb32ca509bf08d31b56f93058d414) fix #12868",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12914:167,depend,dependent,167,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12914,1,['depend'],['dependent']
Integrability,"bal. The RDirectory is more self-documenting than ""new"", but C++ one makes the file self documenting, not just the line of code. And, all else equal, vanilla is better. But by far the more important point is that I don't like example 2 or the PR. Regarding point 2, example 1 is surely more scalable. I already scaled it more than is possible with the PR. Of course you can edit the PR to make new key names on each call so that the RDirectory call can create more things. But scalable means I did it without needing to modify the underlying implementation or interface (which someone else might maintain) to get three plots instead of one. Furthermore, coming back to issue 1, **if you do edit the PR to have flexible (sequential or passed) RDirectory names, you also (edit: might) need to add explicit deletes (more lines of code) somewhere if you run it all in a batch loop, or you'll have a leak.**(**edit**: depending on exactly how the looping and naming is done, but it can easily happen) In other words a portion of the new/delete problem has just been hidden under new with a different name. This is exactly what I mean by modern ownership models. In example 1 the top level code asked for memory that it owns. In my class version it made an instance that it owns. Objects are scoped only as far as requested. When that scope dies, or the container is reset, it's cleaned up where it is made. That's what smart pointers are all about. The PR as-is won't leak, but only because it's not flexible enough to create different things. It's a fragile grammar and in the end I'd rather worry about adding top-level ""keep"" statements than top level ""deletes"". In the C++ global version of example 2, to get the serial loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then.

The implementation of the RooDSCBShape is not super elegant because it has a lot of code duplication that would only get worse with the further parametrzation. To clear this up, we could implement one modern and fully parametrized crystal ball shape with a clear name like **RooCrystalBall** that can serve as a drop-in replacement for both RooCBShape and RooDSCBShape as well as cover the usecase of the asymmetric Gaussian core. Such a class and a rigurous test is implemented in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257, which can serve as a starting point for this development. In addition to the commit suggested in the PR, there are a few more things that could be done to make RooCrystalBall the new standard:. * Write documentation.; * Implement batch computation interface.; * Maybe even deprecate the old shapes somehow. They probably need to be kept for backwards compatibility, but they could be put in RooFitMore and the user gets a nudge to use the new shape if it is used.

First is that we *must* build a dictionary before we use a header file. We are likely missing a build dependency on `ROOTGpadv7`. I believe you are trying to fix the second problem. Namely, `TLine.hxx` includes `TPadPainter.hxx` which includes `TDisplayItem.hxx` and you end up with the cycle `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives -> ROOTGpadv7 -> ROOTGraphicsPrimitives`. It seems that `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives` is a foundational module. Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required.

Integrability,"builtins for ZeroMQ to ease dependency management: libzmq and cppzmq. The builtin for libzmq is especially necessary at this point because it has recently gained a necessary feature that has not been released yet.; > ; > RooFit::MultiProcess is a task-based parallelization framework.; > ; > It uses forked processes for parallelization, as opposed to threads. We chose this approach because A) the existing RooRealMPFE parallelization framework already made use of forks as well, so we had something to build on and B) it was at the time deemed infeasible to check the entire RooFit code for thread-safety. Moreover, we use MultiProcess to parallelize gradients -- i.e. the tasks to be executed in parallel are partial derivatives -- and these are sufficiently large tasks that communication in between tasks is not a big concern in the big fits that we aimed to parallelize.; > ; > The communication between processes is done using ZeroMQ.

Integrability,"bviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is Roo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:1126,depend,dependency,1126,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Updates for category interfaces:; - Provide new interfaces for categories to work without RooCatType.; - Add bracket operator and constructor arguments to define multiple; category states at once or using category[""stateName""] = 1.; - Mark legacy interfaces exposing RooCatType as deprecated in doxygen.; - Stop including RooCatType when R__LESS_INCLUDES is set.; - Flag legacy interfaces with R__SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE.; - Don't create RooCatType instances, unless users continue to use; the legacy interface.; - Provide functions hasIndex() and hasLabel() to check validity of; index/label.; - Provide function states() with direct access to map of category names; to category numbers.; - Add functions getCurrent{Index|Label} to make clear that they access; class state. - Prevent clearing of shapeDirty in RooAbsCategory::evaluate(), since; derived category classes might need to recompute their shapes if one; of their input categories change.

Integrability,"ce, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2. To make this all work, we also had to upgrade precision of the transformation functions to long double instead of double, otherwise round off errors would still persist and ruin any chances of exact bit-wise equality.; 2. In `mathcore`: Some additions to `IFunction` were made to allow Minuit2 to probe functions for their ability to generate gradients and second derivatives. Similar additions were made to function adapter classes in Minuit2.; 3. In RooFit:; 1. Most RooMinimizerFcn functionality was moved into an abstract base class RooAbsMinimizerFcn, which in turn forms the base class of the new RooMinimizerFcn, but also of the added RooGradMinimizerFcn (serial, but gradient external to Minuit2) and MinuitFcnGrad (with parallel MultiProcess back-end) classes.; 2. The RooRealMPFE based classes can make use of an added parameter `CPUAffinity`. In Unix systems (not macOS), this makes the MPFE based parallelization a lot faster by pinning processes to physical CPU cores.; 3. To accomodate the new minimization frameworks, RooMinimizer was changed quite a bit as well. It is still backwards compatible, but the new functionality can be accessed through a new `create` template factory function.

Integrability,"ch is required to write the integral in a computationally feasiable way.; tutorials/math/Voigt.C - Add a tutorial which shows the use of the new VoigtRelativistic class two produce two plots, comparing relativistic voigt to non relativistic voigt, both as the voigt itself and their dumping functions.; Files modified:; math/mathmore/CMakeLists.txt; math/mathmore/inc/Math/LinkDef.h - These two files needed to be modified to compile my changes adding in the relativisitc voigt. **Full description**; Implemented relativistic version of voigt (non-relativistic case already exists in TMath). As previously discussed in the ROOT forum https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/relativistic-breit-wigner-and-relativistic-voigt/48844 , the relativistic version has been added to mathmore rather than TMath, as it requires including a header file with an integrator which is CPU intensive. This has hence been added as it's own class in mathmore, with two functions:. static double evaluate(double x, double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);; static double dumpingFunction(double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);. The default integrationRange was chosen as the integral has been wrote in a form where it is multiplied by exp(-t^2), and this value of integrationRange results in going to the point where exp(-t^2) reaches the minimum value stored by a double. A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute. This is shown in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09304.pdf equation 9 which has been used here. I am unsure how referencing works with ROOT. [Note: the function used here is not actually identical to equation 9, as the paper linked uses a different normalization than ROOT does for the non relativistic voigt which is al",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049:1716,integrat,integrationRange,1716,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049,1,['integrat'],['integrationRange']

It may be that because I have other versions of LLVM/Clang in the system, z3 got installed and picked up by the builtin LLVM from the ROOT build. Ideally, this sort of behavior of automatically picking whatever is installed on the system should be avoided, as it can cause problems, so I recommend looking into the configuration of the builtin LLVM more closely and either disabling z3 if not used, or adding it to the dependencies of ROOT and enabling by force. - Test tutorial-v7-ntuple-ntpl005_introspection failure is related to uring support, is that tested in nightlies?

Possible solutions include:; * Provide an option not to follow the symlink; * Provide an option to specify the number of super-directory to show.

Integrability,"concatenation of pages from the same page-group can achieve.; - `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()` maps pages from the same page-group to the same attribute key, thus concatenating them on the DAOS-side (i.e. relies on scatter-gathered I/O) until the cage limit is reached. The cage sizes can vary due to page compression and the length of page-groups, thus it is calculated and stored to be referenced when reading back.; - `RWOperation` is generalized to allow many IOVs associated with one attribute key in a request, enabling the non-contiguous buffers of sealed pages to be aggregated into a cage under the same position ID in the object store. ; - `RNTupleLocator`: leverages the changes introduced by PR #11828; all DAOS locators use the type `kDaos` and payload format `RNTupleLocatorObject64`. To locate pages within a cage, the 64-bit payload encodes the cage index in the LS half and the offset in the MS half. If caging is disabled, the offset remains zero, and each 'cage' is trivially the sealed page.; - Currently, there are no plans to enable support for page-wise reading without cluster caching if the desired page is caged, as that use-case is not performant and thus not recommended. Caged pages in DAOS should be accessed with the page buffering read option turned on. By disallowing the reading of a single caged page when the wrapping cage size is unknown, the cage sizes - or upper bounds for them - do not need to be passed to `RPageSourceDaos`; they are trivially devised in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` by accessing all page locators in a buffered page-group. ; - `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` and `RPageSourceDaos::PopulatePageFromCluster()` extract the cage position and offset-in-cage from each sealed page's `RNTupleLocator::fPosition`. The former function has been changed to coalesce the page locators by cage index and perform a single read operation per cage. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally + HPE `delphi` cluster; - [x] updated the docs",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466:2735,wrap,wrapping,2735,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466,1,['wrap'],['wrapping']

Integrability,"copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`. Much more disk space usage that needed, but otherwise also a decent solution. Might even be best.

It may be that because I have other versions of LLVM/Clang in the system, z3 got installed and picked up by the builtin LLVM from the ROOT build. Ideally, this sort of behavior of automatically picking whatever is installed on the system should be avoided, as it can cause problems, so I recommend looking into the configuration of the builtin LLVM more closely and either disabling z3 if not used, or adding it to the dependencies of ROOT and enabling by force. - Test tutorial-v7-ntuple-ntpl005_introspection failure is related to uring support, is that tested in nightlies?

Integrability,"d. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.). The reason I blame the dictionary generation code is that regular C(\+\+) code building with Ninja scales very well to many cores. Even when one has many small libraries in a project, Ninja can start the build of object files before all of the libraries that they depend on would've finished building. (In ATLAS's offline software the very end of a build is taken up purely by library/executable linking steps.). ## To Reproduce. Unfortunately you need a pretty powerful machine to do so... But once you do, just do something similar to what I did:. ```; cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \; -Dall=ON -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dbuiltin_freetype=ON -Dbuiltin_lzma=ON -Dbuiltin_veccore=ON \; -DXROOTD_ROOT_DIR=~/software/xrootd/4.12.2/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt \; -DTBB_ROOT_DIR=~/software/oneTBB/2020.2/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/software/root/6.20.08/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt ../root-6.20.08/; ninja; ```. ## Setup.

Integrability,"dentify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"". Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU would dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the dlopen to registe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:1649,depend,depending,1649,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"dientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets. At construction time within a MinuitFcnGrad, they get passed the same single offset object so that it is always kept synced between the different likelihood calculators. If it isn't synced and the likelihood gets different offsets at different times, the minimizer understandably gets very confused. This was the case before this commit, which was, in fact, a bug.; * For LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob, the offsets are also synchronized to all workers via update_state. For this, we simply check before evaluation whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger. Note that while the LikelihoodGradientJob doesn't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize offsets, because during the gradient calculation the LikelihoodSerial objects on the workers are used to calculate the likelihoods there, so for them the offsets must be up to date.; * The LikelihoodJob contains a LikelihoodSerial member as well now. This allows the LikelihoodJob to trigger calculating the offsets on the master process before sending them to the workers.; * LikelihoodWrapper has some added private helper functions for managing offsets. - Other miscellaneous changes:; * LikelihoodWrapper::setApplyWeightSquared was implemented properly for RooSumL likelihoods as well, passing along the call to component RooUnbinnedLs. Note, however, that it is currently not reachable for users because there is no interface to pass this along from the RooMinimizer, which contains the MinuitFcnGrad, which contains the LikelihoodWrapper. A comment in MinuitFcnGrad.h refers to this, reminding future devs to also flip offsets_reset_ when (un)setting squared weights.; * LikelihoodWrapper now holds the likelihood_ty",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202:2720,synchroniz,synchronize,2720,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronize']

Integrability,"doing more complex analyses with RDF. the first line of the [RDF docs](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) says `ROOT's RDataFrame offers a high level interface for analyses of data stored in TTree, CSV's and other data formats. `. Just by the fact that I can read and process other formats than TTree I would say that in general RDF is not meant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. I did not refer to the documentation but to how people would actually use this class. 99% of people do not read CSV files with ROOT and `RDataFrame` will be mostly used to interact in a simple and quick way with trees. > ; > > there should be a function that allows us to merge them; > ; > If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above.

The build starts ""pretty much"" at the left hand side of the timeline, and lasts until ""pretty much"" the right hand side of it. As you can see, the build starts out very well. Building LLVM scales perfectly to 64 threads. And I believe it would scale well to even beyond that. But once the LLVM build is done, many bottlenecks show up. First there is a big bottleneck with building `libCling` and `rootcling`, but after that the build of `libRIO` is also taking a surprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.). The reason I blame the dictionary generat",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432:1337,depend,dependencies,1337,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"dy. However, I would like to put this forward not as a ""final MR"" (would need to be rebased anyway), but as a way to get a preliminary review of this code. Purpose: HistFactory and RooWorkspace should be able to import and export their contents from and to text files, using a common JSON/YAML syntax. Method: The code has been written in such a way as to. - Minimize the amount of changes to existing code; - Make it as easy as possible for users to add new serializers/deserializers for new or existing classes; - Provide a clean interface as much as possible. Dependencies: The code requires a JSON/YML parser and emitter.; ROOT already includes the nlohmann JSON module, which is used as a default for the interface.; However, for development, I have been using the rapidyml package, which also supports reading and writing of YML files. As the code for this already exists, I have kept this in as an optional dependency. When available, it replaces the nlohmann interface and then also provides YML reading and writing capabilities, while the default is limited to JSON. Please review:. - general coding style; - packaging: Should these new files continue to live in RooStats, or should they go to a new subpackage of RooFit?; - code placement: Is the way I split the functionality up into different source files acceptable, or would you wish for a smaller/higher granularity of the splitting?; - build system: Is the way I encoded the optional dependency acceptable?; - class and function names: Are the names of classes and functions acceptable, or should things be renamed to be more conformant?. Please don't review yet:; - lack of functionality - more things will be added over time; - individual violations of the style guide (e.g. missing spaces or newlines) . Please specifically suggest where documenation should be added!; Does every function need a docstring, or just the ones announced in header files?

Then, from `/math/minuit2/build` run:. ```bash; cmake .. -Dminuit2-standalone=ON; make package_source; make purge; ```. ### You can also build Minuit2 for testing (standalone option on or off) with:. ```; make; ```. ### And you can make a prebuilt binary package with:. ```; make package; ```.

Then from the `math/minuit2/build directory` of your ROOT checkout, run:. ```; ""C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe"" ..; ""C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe"" --build .; ""C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe"" --build . --target package; ```.

It is dangerous and requires adding too many lines of code. > * store some unique identifier in each tree when it's produced (even a timestamp works, and although it's not elegant you don't have to worry about having that same value stored in each event because it will compress almost perfectly, occupying very little extra space on disk). With that unique identifier per tree you can build another tree that serves as a lookup table between id and index. It will have two branches, `id` and `index`, with the first taking the values of the ids of each tree and the second being an index from 0 to nTrees-1. Then you can use `TTree::BuildIndex` and `TChain::AddFriend` to add that lookup table tree as a friend of the original chain and thanks to `BuildIndex` the correct value of `index` will be returned for each event depending on the value of `id` in the original chain. More info at https://root.cern/manual/trees/#indexing-trees. We would have to run again all the jobs in the grid to store a unique ID. However the name of the file identifies it, so we deduce the index with the filename. The rest of the solution is close to what I did below.; ; > * do a pass on each input tree to calculate whatever other quantities you need to calculate (let's call these trees `aux1`, `aux2` etc.), then make a TChain out of the original trees, another TChain out of the `aux` trees, and then add the second chain as a friend of the first (effectively creating a single large ""virtual"" TTree with everything in it). OK, that is closer to what we need, I managed to get the code below to add these indexes in a slightly different way from what you said (or maybe the same if I misunderstood you), i.e. using chains and friend trees:. ```python; im",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-932494638:1807,depend,depending,1807,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-932494638,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"e issue is a bit silly and it has to do with how we compute a reasonable default value for the `npartitions` attribute if the user doesn't provide one. The idea, for the moment at least, is to get information about how many cores are available in the distributed cluster to the user application and submit one task per core. In the case of Dask, this is done by accessing the `client.scheduler_info()` dictionary, which in turn contains a `worker` key which value is another dictionary of information about the workers. [The current approach](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/adf9ea8131ce786f58ff2d9446449f9680063292/bindings/experimental/distrdf/python/DistRDF/Backends/Dask/Backend.py#L45) assumed that if this key was present than it must mean that the Dask client has the information about how many cores are available. Unfortunately, as you just demonstrated, this is not the case. In particular, the `dask-jobqueue` interface has a rather annoying quirk, that is whenever you have already called the code to setup the `cluster` and the `client` objects, nothing is really ""ready to run"" yet. Instead, your Dask application will still be waiting for the batch system (HTCondor in this case) to actually give it resources. This has the side-effect that the dictionary I mentioned above contains the key `workers`, but that is an empty dictionary. You can check this by adding a ; ```python; print(client.scheduler_info()); ```; call after you create your `client` in the application. This effect can be mitigated if you first call `client.wait_for_workers(N_WORKERS)` before calling anything else RDF related. This will supposedly make sure that HTCondor has released resources to the Dask cluster (according to [the docs](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#distributed.Client.wait_for_workers)). With that being said, the `optimize_npartitions` function in the Dask backend should not be sensitive to this kind of effect, so in the linked PR I made the check a bit stronger s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655:1003,interface,interface,1003,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"e possible, have full felxibility and stay consistent with the other TGraph classes which are all using pointers for 1D arrays. Nevertheless I understand your concerns since double pointers for arrays are a rather dirty way of programming. I think it might be a good compromise to use the ROOT array wrapper class TArrayD. Then the two dimensional Arrays could be represented by an 1D array of TArrayD objects. The functions SetPointEY, SetPointEYL and SetPointEYH were implemented by me to keep full consistency with the TGraphAsymmErrors class. They are overloaded with one version taking the point and an array in which case the array cointains all errors of the named point for the different dimensions. My idea was to alter the TGraphAsymmErrors notation as little as possible so TGraphAsymmErrors::SetPointEY(i, el, eh) would translate to TGraphMultiErrors::SetPointEY(i, &el, &ey) in the case of only one error dimension which would be equal to a TGraphAsymmErrors. The idea of the function SetDimensionEY, SetDimensionEYL and SetDimensionEYH is basically the same. They set the errors of all points in the given dimension. My idea was to think of a way to convert from multiple TGraphAsymmErrors objects to one single TGraphMultiErrors object like in this small example:; ```; TGraphAsymmErrors* statisticErrors = ...; TGraphAsymmErrors* systematicErrors = ... TGraphMultiErrors* theGraph = new TGraphMultiErrors(statisticErrors->GetN(), 2, statisticErrors->GetX(), statisticErrors->GetY(), statisticErrors->GetEXlow(), statisticErrors->GetEXhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(0, statisticErrors->GetEYlow(), statisticErrors->GetEYhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(1, systematicErrors->GetEYlow(), systematicErrors->GetEYhigh());; ```. But again I see your point since there is no check whether the passed array has a sufficient size. Maybe here it would also be a good solution to use the wrapper class TArrayD instead since it provides the neccessary information and is rather lightweight.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-516408489:2122,wrap,wrapper,2122,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-516408489,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Then, you can change the commits you want to fuse from `pick` to `fixup`, which will combine them with the previous commit, like this:. ```; pick ede15457be Adding new option to set MaxVirtualSize to a negative value causing one cluster of baskets kept in memory; fixup 3035c73a31 Adding new option to set MaxVirtualSize to a negative value causing that many clusters of baskets kept in memory; fixup 275d909504 Adding new option to set MaxVirtualSize to a negative value causing that many clusters of baskets kept in memory Just some indentation changes.; fixup c25ea30332 Make some clang format changes; fixup dae3241bee Fix whitespace; fixup baa80f53a4 Fix memory leak; fixup a8324c92ee Undo TBranch version change, thanks Philippe.; ```.

Adding new option to set MaxVirtualSize to a negative value causing one cluster of baskets kept in memory; ```. Since the message is quite long, I also did `git commit --amend`, which lets you edit your message and save it. At the end, I have this:. ```; commit 891b51caa6089e13997e2d2e0aa25f869970e878; Author: Peter van Gemmeren <gemmeren@anl.gov>; Date: Tue Jul 18 17:47:58 2017 -0500.

Integrability,"ect description of standard mixing in GCC documents, but it seems that they do not point out that changing standards will lead to changes in ABI compatibility (If so, it means that the backward compatibility of the C++ standard is violated, which seems serious). I tend to think that this compatibility is guaranteed, but it does require more evidence. > I also don't understand how `cxx20::span` would solve anything: we want users to be able to use the stdlib `span` with ROOT, if their stdlib provides it. In fact, if the user uses the same standard as ROOT, the current situation is very good. I propose to change the name on the premise that users are allowed to link to ROOT with different standards. Typically, if the user is using a higher standard, the `std::span` in the std library will be exposed and conflict with the ROOT version `std::(inline)__ROOT::span`. In order to resolve the conflict, we have to take the second place: if we use `cxx20::span` and provide an interface to convert from/to standard `std::span`, then even if there are differences in standards, the two sides will not interfere with each other. If users have `std::span`, they can use it; If not, they should not get an implementation from ROOT in the std namespace (which affects their subsequent upgrade to a higher version of the C++ standard). All in all, it provides an implementation independent of std when the true `std::span` is not available, and prevents name conflict when mixing the standard.; Of course, if want ROOT to use `std::span` of the standard library when feasible (e.g. complie with C++20), we can just use `cxx20::span` as the alias of `std::span`. However, after then the user cannot be allowed to go back to a standard lower than C++20, otherwise `span` will missing in the header file, and the ROOT internal implementation of `span` should not be use as the fallback - if so, there may be a compatibility problem, caused by the so-called ODR violation. > To come back to my question: shou",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1254659106:1875,interface,interface,1875,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1254659106,1,['interface'],['interface']

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug. On Linux, in a Juyter/ROOT Python notebook, every cell execution makes the `python` process open two ""files"":; ; lrwx------ 1 user users 64 2 Jun 22.33 77 -> /dev/pts/7; lr-x------ 1 user users 64 2 Jun 22.33 78 -> 'pipe:[214404]'; ; one to the terminal bound to the notebook server (`/dev/pts/7`), and another always a different pipe reading for nothing to write in it, e.g. from `lsof`:; ; python3.8 16586 user 78r FIFO 0,10 0t0 214404 pipe; ; These stay open, making the process reach the OS limit of open files sooner or later, at which point grief ensues.; Some commands (e.g. `matplotlib` figures) may create additional pairs out of the void. ### Expected behavior. The open file descriptor count should be roughly stable and not proportional to the number of executed cells. ### To Reproduce; ; jupyter --notebook # or root --notebook; ; then execute _(empty lines mark cell boundaries)_:; ```.py; import os; def printFiles(): print(f""PID={os.getpid()} files={len(os.listdir(f'/proc/{os.getpid()}/fd'))}""); printFiles(). printFiles(). printFiles(). printFiles(). import ROOT; printFiles(). printFiles(). printFiles(). printFiles(); ```; I get a file count of `43` or `44` on each cell before importing ROOT, and from the _next_ cell, each cell increments by 4 (`48`, `52`, ...).; The issue does not appear on plain `python`/`ipython`. ### Setup.

However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess?

Integrability,"ementation. The degradation is caused by tbb function:. tbb::internal::custom_scheduler<tbb::internal::IntelSchedulerTraits>::receive_or_steal_task(long&). I suspect the reason is because #785 in the following function:. https://github.com/zzxuanyuan/root/blob/15cceff19b48dfe4a4b0c69c1ec07ea75bd1ccb5/tree/tree/src/TTreeCacheUnzip.cxx#L708. CreateTasks() explicitly creates 2 tasks (empty_task and MappingTask; and set_ref_count(2) means 2 tasks in total). The scheduler might make a better decision here since it knows there will be only one task except empty_task running in future. On the other hand, TTaskGroup uses tbb::task_group which calls the following function:. https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L108. task_group_base() also first creates a empty_task. However, it only creates 1 task(itself) by setting reference count as 1 (set_ref_count(1)). When it invoke another task by calling . https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L103. allocate_additional_child() will create a new task as child and increment reference count by 1. I guess accumulating tasks on-the-fly might degrade the performance since the tbb scheduler could spend more time on finding tasks to work on. In a short, I think explicitly defining the total number of tasks and task graph should have better performance (more efficient for scheduler I guess) than adding more tasks to task_group as the program runs. There are two alternative approaches that might improve the performance. ; 1. Since we have already know we will only have one task (except empty_task) to add into the task_group, we could revise TTaskGroup interface and notify it what task is going to run in advance.; 2. We could get rid of TTaskGroup in my current implemention and synchronously map baskets to different tasks. If we do not mind a little performance drops, the current implementation should be fine.

The `DeclareCallable` dispatches between numba and the generic implementation. It tries to compile the thingy with numba (falls through silently) and otherwise tries the generic implementation (fails noisily).; However, you can force using the generic implementation or numba by using the decorators `DeclareGenericCallable` and `DeclareNumbaCallable`. The interface is exactly the same than for the general `DeclareCallable` decorator. In addition, you can now give the wrapped function a custom name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++. The mechanism builds with cling a C++ wrapper class around Python callables and publishs them to the user. See following example for the basic mechanism. ```python; import ROOT. # Because C++ is strongly typed, we have to declare the types of the inputs and the output; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float""); def func(x):; return 2.0 * x. print(func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; print(ROOT.PyROOT.func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << PyROOT::func(1.0) << endl;"") # Prints 2.0; ```. This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(x):; return numpy.power(x, 2). df = ROOT.RDataFrame(4).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry_"").Define(""y"", ""PyROOT::func(x)""); npy = df.AsNumpy(); print(npy[""x""]) # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]; print(npy[""y""]) # Prints [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0]; ```.

Integrability,"er/CMakeLists.txt` and runtime searches in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CIFactory.cpp`. Below I'm listing a number of things I noticed, and I think it would be worth it to clean up this business:. - [ ] Let's start with the obvious: `CLING_CXX_PATH` and `CLING_CXX_HEADERS` are declared as `option`s in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CMakeLists.txt`. This gives them a type of `BOOL` instead of `STRING` (or maybe `FILEPATH` for `CLING_CXX_PATH`?).; - [ ] If these variables are not set by the user, the build system starts to make some guesses. These choices are not `FORCE`d back into the `CACHE`, so it will be re-computed on every CMake invocation.; - [ ] The code for determining `CLING_CXX_PATH` has a large section dealing with `ccache` and `distcc`, which can only be taken if users set the environment variable `CXX=""ccache g++""`. Since CMake 3.4, it is recommended to instead use `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`, or ROOT's `ccache=ON`, so this may be obsolete?; - [ ] The header lookup is inconsistent between the build system and the `CIFactory`: The messages during configuration suggest that the order is; 1. Determined directories of C++ headers, or if not found; 2. Invocation of the compiler's full path, or as a fallback; 3. Invocation of the compiler's relative path. I think this matches the initial implementation, but it's not true anymore since commit afabc3b63885427251fd69b4aeda887bae35a289 switched to asking the compiler in the `PATH` first, to address a problem report from CMS.; - [ ] It also appears that the default guess from the build system is to *either* set the compiler's full path *or* its relative path. This is potentially problematic because changing the `PATH` could make the interpreter pick up a different compiler, even though it could still ask the existing full path. It's also inconsistent with respect to the previous point because a compiler in `PATH` takes precedence over the directories determined at build time, while a compiler out",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612:1225,message,messages,1225,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612,1,['message'],['messages']
Integrability,"er` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kRNTuple` |. ## Implementation; As mentioned, the existing `Snapshot` interface is used. A new `SnapshotRNTupleHelper` has been created to handle the creation and writing of the RNTuple, akin to the existing `SnapshotHelper` (which has been renamed to `SnapshotTTreeHelper` for consistency). ### RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f); The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. ### Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02); For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`. To avoid dependency conflicts related to including `ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx`, the free `FromRNTuple` functions have been moved to a separate header. ## Current limitations and follow-ups; This PR adds the minimal functionality for (single-threaded) snapshotting to RNTuple. A number of follow-ups are foreseen:. ### RNTuple write options; Currently no RNTuple-specific write options have been added to `RSnapshotOptions` yet, except for compression settings which were already present as an option. Adding (a subset) of the other `RNTupleWriteOptions` is trivial. ### Default compression settings; `RSnapshotOptions`' default compression setting is 101 (Zlib). However, RNTuple's default compression setting is 505 (zstd). We could change the default compression setting to `kInherit` and decide which settings to use according to the target data format (unless explicitly set by the user, of course). ### Multithreaded snapshotting; This PR only adds single-threaded RNTuple snapshotting.

Integrability,"ery strict source compatibility requirements: ""we should only break source compatibility if the ROOT constructs were actively harmful in some way, the volume of affected ROOT code is relatively small, and we can provide source compatibility and migration"". As discussed with @pcanal, and with TExecutor introduced in ROOT 6.08, there's little possibilities any user has implemented a new derived class from TExecutor. If this happened, the user is most probably advanced enough to be able to change the implementation. In any case, the volume of affected ROOT code will be relatively small. . As suggested by @dpiparo, for the moment we will keep the new ```TExecutor``` in ```ROOT::Internals```, not exposing it to the user. The executor usage will look as following:. ```cpp ; ROOT::Internal::TExecutor pool(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial);; auto mapFunction = [](unsigned i){return 1u;};; auto reductionFunction = [](const std::vector<unsigned> &v) {; return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0u);; };. pool.MapReduce(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial, mapFunction, ROOT::TSeq<unsigned>(20), reductionFunction);; ```. **TLDR;** This PR changes the behaviour of existing executors and introduces; new ones:. * TExecutor: changes its functionality to be a general Executor, while; TExecutorBaseImpl takes the role of the previous TExecutor. TExecutor; now acts as a general interface to the executors. The executor it will; resolve to is specified by a execution policy parameter in its; constructor. * TExecutorBaseImpl: Plays the previous role of TExecutor. * TSequentialExecutor: provides a sequential implementation of the; executor model, defined by TExecutorBaseImpl. This PR is not finished, but I'm opening it for discussion. Things left:; - [x] Change kSerial to kSequential. - [x] Move Execution Policies to ROOT::Internal. - [x] Adapt Fitting functions to use the new TExecutor instead of if statements.

Integrability,"es; `RooAbsCategory.h, RooCategory.h`; The former is the base class of all categories, the latter the user-facing implementation. Here's what happened:; RooFit categories were using the class RooCatType (: public TObject); instead of an integer to represent category states.; This class contained an integer and a char[256] to store a category index; and a (possibly truncated) state name. This prevented fast batch access,; and increased the overhead for data storage and data loading. From now on, categories are represented as integers.; Every state can be denoted by index or name, but instead of storing; *both packed into an object* in each row of the dataset, only the index is stored, and the; mapping from index to state name is stored in the category instance. Since all the category classes were happily using the RooCatType, several; parts had to be touched to convert everything to using integers. This feature; has been cooking since March, and the interface for category classes was; discussed in the PPP, but nevertheless, have a double look at the above-mentioned; headers. In more detail:; - Replace RooCatType by an integer.; - Replace names saved in each row of dataset with RooCatType by a map in; RooAbsCategory that maps state names to numbers. This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Provide legacy iterator for iterating through states instances of; RooCatType, which will be created on the fly.; - Make RooVectorDataStore store integers instead of RooCatType instances.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore.; - Outline functions that polluted the header of RooVectorDataStore.

Integrability,"esult.; * As its perfectly legal to cast `TSystemDirectory *` to `TSystemFile *`, a `TSystemFile *tsysfFoo` with name ""foo"" and title ""foo"" could mean either; * A file with path `foo/foo`; * A directory with path `foo`, which was originally an instance of `TSystemDirectory *`. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->. The name-title interface of both `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` is unified. Due to the inconsistency of the original interface, there's no fully-backward-compatible solution. The possible interface would be one of the followings:. | Name | Title | Pros | Cons |; |-|-|-|-|; | basename | dirname | the most informative and good-looking; closer to what GetListOfFiles() tries to output | incompatible to the original `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` interfaces |; | basename | full path | closer to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | dirname | closer to the original `TSystemFile` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | basename | closer to the original `TSystemFile` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | full path | closer to the original `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` interfaces | carry the least information |. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 4. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->. #### Wrong `IsDirectory()` from `TSystemDirectory::GetListOfFiles()` elements; ```console; $ mkdir bar; $ mkdir foodir; $ touch foodir/foo; $ touch foodir/bar; $ tree; .; ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bar; ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foodir; ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bar; ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foo. 2 directories, 2 files; $ root -l; root [0] for (const auto &&tsysfChildRaw: *TSystemDirectory(""foodir"", ""foodir"").GetL",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12350:2043,interface,interfaces,2043,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12350,8,['interface'],"['interface', 'interfaces']"

Integrability,"ets the path of the directory from its title (`fTitle`), and returns a `TList *`, each element in which represents the child item (with basename `file` and path `sdirpath`) inside the directory the following ways:; * If the element is a directory, it would be `new TDirectory(file, sdirpath)`; * If the element is a file, it would be `new TFile(file, fTitle)`. Which results in the following bugs:. * If an element of `TSystemDirectory::GetListOfFiles()` is a file, its `IsDirectory()` will try to look for the file basename in the *current working directory* and produce the wrong result.; * As its perfectly legal to cast `TSystemDirectory *` to `TSystemFile *`, a `TSystemFile *tsysfFoo` with name ""foo"" and title ""foo"" could mean either; * A file with path `foo/foo`; * A directory with path `foo`, which was originally an instance of `TSystemDirectory *`. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->. The name-title interface of both `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` is unified. Due to the inconsistency of the original interface, there's no fully-backward-compatible solution. The possible interface would be one of the followings:. | Name | Title | Pros | Cons |; |-|-|-|-|; | basename | dirname | the most informative and good-looking; closer to what GetListOfFiles() tries to output | incompatible to the original `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` interfaces |; | basename | full path | closer to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | dirname | closer to the original `TSystemFile` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | basename | closer to the original `TSystemFile` interface | incompatible to the original `TSystemDirectory` interface |; | full path | full path | closer to the original `TSystemFile` and `TSystemDirectory` interfaces | carry the least information |. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12350:1600,interface,interface,1600,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12350,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"evel 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros. Level 1 would enable the warning messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag WARNINGMSG is defined. Level 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero.

Integrability,"feedback. The bulk IO APIs aim to provide as fast access as possible in the case where the user is using relatively simple datatypes and the objects can be deserialized ""non-destructively"" (i.e., in-place in the existing memory buffers). For example - primitives and lists of primitives are supported; anything needing references are not. Despite the fact many of ROOT's very useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:. * A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; * A TTreeReader-like interface, TTreeReaderFast. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize and apply user code, rather than two.; * The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by TDataFrame, provided we can make TDataFrame sufficiently fast.; * A Python-based numpy export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; * The numpy interface is low-level for Python; we intend to furt",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2519:1318,interface,interfaces,1318,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2519,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"g at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3. The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:; This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck. The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4, possibly at the cost of some extra file size. A note on caching:. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache - consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed. On Linux this can be done by running `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` as a superuser or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame:. rootreadspeed is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic, higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by rootreadspeed (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:6027,interface,interfaces,6027,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"g the underlying implementation to get three instances. But this RDirectory version shown here and the C++ global version here are certainly not different in that respect. The C++ globals actually win on line count here if you like this code structure better (I do). I'd argue if one needs the extern header declarations to pass things around in compiled code, he should ask if he's doing it wrong, and that's not an usual sentiment. The whole point is I think to make things visible from the interpreter or other things spawned from it. That's surely why we got here, and if C++ globals makes it tedious to access them everywhere in compiled code, I call that a bonus. . On the other hand I don't like this ; example2: ; ```cpp; {; // my_subroutines.C; unique_ptr<TH1> x // used in my_subroutine. void my_subroutine() {; x.reset(); ; x.reset(new TH1F());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```; except for maybe quick temporary scripts. So we have about 2.5 issues. ; 1) The global command,; 2) the interface and ownership model, and; 2.5) with the way it's done in the PR also the non-castable syntax issue. Issue 2.5 is already covered. I do still like C++ globals better even in example 2. It separates how to make a TH1 from how to make it global. The RDirectory is more self-documenting than ""new"", but C++ one makes the file self documenting, not just the line of code. And, all else equal, vanilla is better. But by far the more important point is that I don't like example 2 or the PR. Regarding point 2, example 1 is surely more scalable. I already scaled it more than is possible with the PR. Of course you can edit the PR to make new key names on each call so that the RDirectory call can create more things. But scalable means I did it without needing to modify the underlying implementation or interface (which someone else might maintain) to get three plots instead of one.

They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them.

There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3.

Integrability,"had issues with dictionary operations; sometimes failing with clang assertions. When this happens, it is; of course only in the debug build; in the optimized build,; everything seems to work fine. The problem; is related to the ordering in which dictionaries are loaded --- we can; usually make the crashes go away by forcing a particular dictionary; loading order. This appears to be related to the traits-like class that we use to specify; the inheritance relations for our DataVector class. Schematically, it looks; like this:. ```; struct NoBase {};. template <class T>; struct DataVectorBase; {; typedef NoBase Base;; };. // Specialized derived version.; template <class T, class BASE = typename DataVectorBase<T>::Base>; class DataVector : public BASE {...};. // Base class version.; template <class T>; class DataVector<T, NoBase> {...};; ```. where user classes then specialize the DataVectorBase class; (in practice, done via a macro).

Integrability,"he generic implementation or numba by using the decorators `DeclareGenericCallable` and `DeclareNumbaCallable`. The interface is exactly the same than for the general `DeclareCallable` decorator. In addition, you can now give the wrapped function a custom name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++. The mechanism builds with cling a C++ wrapper class around Python callables and publishs them to the user. See following example for the basic mechanism. ```python; import ROOT. # Because C++ is strongly typed, we have to declare the types of the inputs and the output; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float""); def func(x):; return 2.0 * x. print(func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; print(ROOT.PyROOT.func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << PyROOT::func(1.0) << endl;"") # Prints 2.0; ```. This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(x):; return numpy.power(x, 2). df = ROOT.RDataFrame(4).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry_"").Define(""y"", ""PyROOT::func(x)""); npy = df.AsNumpy(); print(npy[""x""]) # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]; print(npy[""y""]) # Prints [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0]; ```. Finally, the approach is fully compatible with any custom C++ types you may have. ```python; import ROOT. ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; struct Foo {; static const int foo = 42;; };; """"""). @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""Foo""], """"); def func(x):; print(x.foo). ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""Foo x; PyROOT::func(x);"") # Prints 42; ```; There are still some things to check before merging:. - [ ] Double check reference counting; - [ ] C++ wrapper takes (lvalue) references, what happens with rvalues? What is the universal thingy?; - [ ] We put the C++ callable in the `PyROOT::` namespace. This is fine?

Integrability,"his:; ```; y; B; y; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx A xxxxxx; y; y; ```; where A and B are the minima along the x and y axis respectively. This approach has the advantage that the number of function evaluations scales like with k * n, where k is the number of dimensions and n the number of steps per dimension, while a full grid search scales like n ^ k. However, this approach will fail miserably when x and y are correlated, trying this on the Rosenbrock function for instance gives terrible results (basically no improvement with respect to the starting value). ### What to do?. The current behavior of MnScan is not what people usually consider a scan, which most people understand as a full grid search over the whole N-dimensional space. It seems that MnScan is not really used in ROOT, but I may be mistaken. If it is not really used, I would suggested to keep the name MnScan and change the implemenation to do a full hypercube scan. I am strongly convinced that MnScan should do a full grid search instead of what it currently does, because the current implementation is fairly pointless for most real-world functions which have correlations. If MnScan has a use case that I am not aware of, then I propose to add a new Minimizer, MnHyperScan (or similar name), which implements the full scan. ### Other issues with current MnScan. - One cannot configure the number of steps taken per dimension when MnScan is called through the minimizer interface (MnApplication). The maxcalls option should be used for this.; - A gradient and second derivatives are computed for the starting values, only to be discarded. This is wasteful.; - The scan returns EDM = 0, which is very misleading. It should either return inf or NaN, to indicate that the EDM is invalid. Ideally, a proper EDM should be calculated for the obtained minimum after the scan.; - MnScan always builds a vector of all the (parameter, function value) pairs obtained during the scan, but that vector is discarded after the run. This is wasteful.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6862:2361,interface,interface,2361,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6862,1,['interface'],['interface']

Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required. This is how the current master's modulemap looks like (maybe this helps to see the cycle).; ```; module ""ROOTGraphicsPrimitives"" {; requires cplusplus; module ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStyle.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TStyle.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TText.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/T",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607:2414,depend,depend,2414,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607,1,['depend'],['depend']

As for the original CMake configuration error, my guess is that the CMake target ""host"" used to be part of the CMake project, but is no longer part of the CMake project, and that the error message in `interpreter/cling/CMakeLists.txt:196` was not updated to reflect this when the CMake target ""host"" was removed from the CMake project.

Integrability,"include them or comment them out. On Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (gcc 9.4.0), with ROOT version from 6.12.06 to 6.28.04, none of the combinations got to work. For instance, when the TMapFile works with ROOT 6.12.06, then the TApplication returns an error of ""Segmentation violation"". With a newer ROOT, e.g. 6.28.04, the TApplication works but the TMapFile got the error message; *****************************************************************************; Error in <TMapFile::TMapFile> : no memory mapped file capability available; Use rootn.exe or link application against ""-lNew""; *****************************************************************************. Could you guys have a look at this problem and find out what happened or may find a solution? Many thanks in advance. Huagen Xu from FZ Juelich, IKP; [root_examples.zip](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/12415948/root_examples.zip). ### Reproducer. As attached, there are three Macro files plus one Makefile. Those three files are all the ROOT examples to demostrate how the TMapFile as well as the TApplication work. To reproduce the problem described above, one could follow the tipps below.; 1. Unzip the file into a local directory ; 2. Open a terminal and cd to the unzipped directory, type ""make"" to compile the files; 3. Run ""./appdemo"" in a terminal to check whether TApplication works properly; 4. Run ""./hisprod"" in a termianl to check whether the TMapFile will be created; 5. Assuming the ""hisprod"" works and creates a ""hsimple.map"" file, run ""./hisplot"" in a new Terminal to check whether the TMapFile and TApplication could work together. In the Makefile, it is required to have the link of -lNew or --new for running TMapFile. With different combinations of ROOT and operating versions, the error message might be different. . ### ROOT version.

Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details ab",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236:1710,depend,depending,1710,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"inor edits to TStreamerInfo. I have attempted this myself for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; (see the attached) and had success with the following:. \- A branch made directly from a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt;; \- A branch made out of a class (call it &amp;quot;TTestClass&amp;quot;) that derives from TObject and contains a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; as a data member; \- A branch made out of a class containing a data member that is a TClonesArray of TTestClass's. The basic idea was to imitate the special-case-handling for the std::string class in the TStreamerInfo::PrintValue() and TStreamerInfo::PrintValueAux(). One issue is that for the STL classes, counter-intuitively TStreamerInfo::fLength = 1, no matter how many entries are in the container, so that PrintValueAux() always gets called with aleng = 1 instead of something related to the size of the array. Rather than mess with fLength, which appears to have important function outside of the PrintValue*() routines, I thought it would be better to simply add lenmax as an additional final parameter to PrintValueAux(), to be used in place of aleng by the stl classes. This could then be compared to the container length and used in the printf loop in the same way that aleng is used for arrays of basic data types. The other issue I ran into is that it is not easy to format the output to make it look &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;. The PrintCR() function used by other data types in PrintValueAux() works well for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; in PrintValue(), so I suggest moving that function declaration up so that it can be used there. However, in PrintValueAux() the printing somehow always looks funny for the case of the TClonesArray of TTestClass's. My guess is that the printing looks funny as well for the other array types handled by PrintValueAux() so maybe this is considered to be okay? At any rate, I tried a number of options and left them in the file in my order of preference with all but the first one (no carriage returns",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14555:1515,rout,routines,1515,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14555,1,['rout'],['routines']

Integrability,"ion whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger. Note that while the LikelihoodGradientJob doesn't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize offsets, because during the gradient calculation the LikelihoodSerial objects on the workers are used to calculate the likelihoods there, so for them the offsets must be up to date.; * The LikelihoodJob contains a LikelihoodSerial member as well now. This allows the LikelihoodJob to trigger calculating the offsets on the master process before sending them to the workers.; * LikelihoodWrapper has some added private helper functions for managing offsets. - Other miscellaneous changes:; * LikelihoodWrapper::setApplyWeightSquared was implemented properly for RooSumL likelihoods as well, passing along the call to component RooUnbinnedLs. Note, however, that it is currently not reachable for users because there is no interface to pass this along from the RooMinimizer, which contains the MinuitFcnGrad, which contains the LikelihoodWrapper. A comment in MinuitFcnGrad.h refers to this, reminding future devs to also flip offsets_reset_ when (un)setting squared weights.; * LikelihoodWrapper now holds the likelihood_type.

Integrability,"ith RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example. > ; > ; > The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; > I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; > The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC. On the other hand, I don't know how to fix this in another way. Perhaps this could be enabled via a special CMake option for ROOT, which enables RTLD_DEEPBIND for libCling and -fPIC for all executables. IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?. > @vgvassilev : I do not see how I could control this.; > https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/base/src/TROOT.cxx#L2037 states that InitInterpreter() should be called after main(). Therefore, as we link to libgandiva, which links to llvm libs, the system LLVM symbols will always be in the global namespace by design. They are loaded before main(), while InitInterpreter() loads libCling only after main(). This check is to protect the subsequent `dlsyms` in TCling to resolve symbols from the wrong place. We can fix the check and play with the JIT resolution logic by playing with the search order here: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/39630b7530771be3e4643048361886dcfb057f07/interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/IncrementalJIT.cpp#L299-L302.

As previously discussed in the ROOT forum https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/relativistic-breit-wigner-and-relativistic-voigt/48844 , the relativistic version has been added to mathmore rather than TMath, as it requires including a header file with an integrator which is CPU intensive. This has hence been added as it's own class in mathmore, with two functions:. static double evaluate(double x, double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);; static double dumpingFunction(double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);. The default integrationRange was chosen as the integral has been wrote in a form where it is multiplied by exp(-t^2), and this value of integrationRange results in going to the point where exp(-t^2) reaches the minimum value stored by a double. A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute.

Integrability,"iz/libcmaes), a novel high performance C++11 (with Python bindings) library for blackbox optimization. The new minimizer yields better results than Minuit2 for most problems, though for an higher computation cost on average. See below for links to relevant benchmarks backing up these claims. This implementation is on behalf of [Inria Saclay Research group TAO](http://www.inria.fr/en/teams/tao), [Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire, group AppStat](http://appstat.lal.in2p3.fr/) and [University Paris-Sud LRI](https://www.lri.fr/index_en.php?lang=EN). ===Features===; - Seamless replacement for Minuit, Minuit2 and Fumili; - Seamless support for RooFit; - Relying on libcmaes allows for best performances known for CMA-ES + access to several flavors of the original algorithm, yielding best results with a trade off for computational cost, as needed; - Compilation support for both Autotools and CMake; - Included tutorial files, tests, and a special benchmark vs Minuit2. ===Documentation===; - Main documentation for building and using the new minimizer is here: https://github.com/beniz/libcmaes/wiki/using-CMA-ES-in-CERN's-ROOT. ===Performances===; - On-par with Minuit2 on low dimensional problems (< 10-D), consistently beats Minuit2 in higher dimension, leading to better fits. These claims are backed by two benchmarks and two experiments on real world data (we are still waiting from some results from usage at CERN); - Benchmark CMA-ES vs Minuit on [BBOB](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2013) available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J1vWYhta9ibktXc2JLRUExUTA&authuser=0; - In-ROOT benchmark vs Minuit2 on low-dimensional problems, results available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J1vWYhta9iTmR0T0hnN21lSGM&authuser=0; - Beats out Minuit2 up to 98% of the time on some experiments (data + code available on demand from Auger group, ask me).

We can identify at least three distinct problems here. 1. First, this code is stupid. It's trying to get the TClass for a pyroot; object. It does this by calling repr on the object (which could result; in something very large) and then trying to extract the class name; and looking it up with TClass. In fact, it looks like this hasn't; actually been working for a while now, because the format of the repr; string changed --- and now doesn't include the 'object' string.; If i change this to instead use Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name, then everything; works (and much faster too!). 2. I originally added this code here, but from the comments, it was copied; from the pyroot of the time. The reason why we're doing this in this; roundabout way to begin with is because the TPython interface doesn't; supply any way to get the TClass from a pyroot object. If it would; add a call for that, than this could be streamlined. 3. Finally, there seems to have been a regression with finding the repr; string for a pyroot object between 6.26.10 and dev4. If i have a loop; just calling repr for a vector<float> instance, it runs very slowly; and eventually starts printing memory errors from cling. But with 6.26.10,; it runs much faster and does not start crashing. It sounds sort of like; code is now being repeatedly jitted each time with dev4, but i have; not tried to verify that. Anyway, this change gets at least the unit tests working. Will try to get; that merged soon, and will try to report the repr issue separately.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12406#issuecomment-1547118274:1449,interface,interface,1449,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12406#issuecomment-1547118274,1,['interface'],['interface']

Note that this happens only for some setups, so I tried to debug it a bit and see what is special about the setups that crash. I will briefly describe what I found out:. We use AddPreprocessFunction() method to reparametrise our likelihood, this generally seems to work, but for some special cases this seems to cause problems. I created the XML files for the problematic setups and tried to use `hist2workspace` to try to identify the issues. I found out that the executable cannot read the XML files produced if it contains `&` and `<` or `>` as these are not valid XML characters and need to be escaped. So e.g. if the top level XML contains function like this:; ```; <Function Name=""morph_topWidth_0.700000"" Expression=""(0.+(((topWidth-0.700000)>=0)&&(fabs(topWidth-0.700000)<0.300000))*(1.-(fabs(topWidth-0.700000))/0.300000))"" Dependents=""topWidth[0.700000,0.700000,2.000000]"" />; ```; The `hist2workspace` executable will complain that it cannot parse the XML. I tried replacing the problematic characters with the XML replacements like `&gt;` etc. This makes the `hist2workspace` code run and it generates the workspace. However, if I try to replace the characters in the same way for the string passed to AddPrepropcessFunction, it doesnt parse the string and complains:; ```; input_line_48:2:89: error: use of undeclared identifier 'gt'; Double_t TFormula____id12625155560414669645(Double_t *x){ return (0.+(((x[0]-0.700000)&{gt;}=0)&#38;&#38;(fabs(x[0]-0.700000)&{lt;0.300000}))*(1.-(fabs(x[0]-0.700000))/0.300000)) ; }; ^; ```. I am not 100% sure these two issue - crash in the `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` code and the XML parsing are related, but I think they could be. . ### Expected behavior; The code should not crash when calling `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` as was the case in ROOT 6.24.06.

Other than these `RooMinimizer` changes and the addition of `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new test was added called `testRooGradMinimizer`. It also uses a `test_lib.h` header that will also be used later on in tests of other new likelihood minimization implementations. **Do note that the test currently fails.** I originally had carefully made sure the results were bit-wise exactly the same as those from using classic `RooMinimizerFcn`, but there must have been some change in the meantime that I have not been able to integrate yet. I suspect it is caused by a change in Kahan summation, but have to inspect. In any case, the results are minor differences that do not negatively affect the effectiveness, the minimization just takes slightly different paths to the end results that will agree within the desired precision when set high enough. ~~**Final note:** this PR depends on three others: #8369, #8567 and #8569. These branches as they currently are were merged into this branch before making the one commit that adds everything in this actual commit. Do not merge this one before those. Also take care that this branch will be rebased and force pushed after each of those three are merged. In short: probably it will be easier to review this branch after those others are merged. However, of course, a review is already most welcome. Just make sure to only look at the diff from the final commit: https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/6b129bedf5f6fe2e971c0a24fce0bf53e6c40284~~. **Update**: two of the above dependency PRs were merged. Only #8567 still needs to be merged and hence is also still included in this PR to make it compile. I have marked these three `math/minuit2` files with a review comment.

Integrability,"king leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol.

TL;DR: After this patch the leftover memory increase may be attributed mostly to Dask or memray itself. To confirm this, I have executed the full AGC benchmark on the SWAN platform with 64 workers of the CERN condor pools for 10 times in a row. At the end of the 10th run all the workers have a total RSS of < 1GB.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470:1801,protocol,protocol,1801,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

Integrability,"l observable terms. This brings the results of these fits closer to the old-style RooNLLVar fits, because those also use per-component offsets (per-RooNLLVar in a RooAddition to be exact).; * In LikelihoodJob::evaluate, the result_ KahanSum is no longer initialized to zero, but is initialized to the first value in the results_ array, both sum and carry term. This sometimes makes a difference: adding a term with a small but non-zero carry term to an existing sum with a zero sum and zero carry term can make the small non-zero carry term disappear.; * Due to these changes and the earlier KahanSum updates, we were able to tighten the tolerance of tests in testLikelihoodSerial, testLikelihoodJob and testLikelihoodGradientJob, with many tests now passing EXPECT_EQ.; * testLikelihoodGradientJob adds offsetting to the parameterized test matrices of the LikelihoodGradientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets. At construction time within a MinuitFcnGrad, they get passed the same single offset object so that it is always kept synced between the different likelihood calculators. If it isn't synced and the likelihood gets different offsets at different times, the minimizer understandably gets very confused. This was the case before this commit, which was, in fact, a bug.; * For LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob, the offsets are also synchronized to all workers via update_state. For this, we simply check before evaluation whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger. Note that while the LikelihoodGradientJob doesn't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize offsets, because during the gradient calculation the LikelihoodSerial objects on the workers are used to calculate the likelihoods there, so for them th",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202:1824,synchroniz,synchronization,1824,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronization']
Integrability,"l obstacles, the main one being that we don't have a single, coherent code path for all data sources. Crucially, `TTree` is handled differently from any other data format (i.e. it doesn't use the `RDataSource` mechanism). This practically means that I cannot create a lazy `RDataSource` to handle them all. But in first approximation this could have been solved with one extra branching; 2. It is not straightforward to know where exactly to trigger the inferring of the data source. Practically, this is needed at the very latest in `RLoopManager::Run`, i.e. right before the start of the event loop. But it can also be needed before that, namely whenever a node of the computation graph is created it might need to know about the column names it uses, so the dataset schema must be gathered thus the data source type must be inferred. Admittedly, this is also another fixable problem with a better documentation or cleaner code to explain exactly at what point of any RDataFrame application the loop manager would need the dataset schema in place; 3. Probably the greatest obstacle posed by this idea is that it indeed fixes one backwards-incompatible change, but introduces another one. RDataFrame allows some operations to run without triggering the computation graph, actually without even needing to populate the computation graph at all. Specifically, `Describe` produces a string description of some metadata of the dataset wrapped by the RDataFrame, e.g. the name of the TTree and the file it is stored in. This info doesn't need file opening (at least with `TChain`). The lazy data source would effectively change the behaviour of `Describe` as it would hide the type of the data source even if in principle it could be known (supposing the same workflow with TChain as before). Bottom line, it was worth to investigate this idea as it also gave more insights on some of the not-immediately-evident parts of the machinery.

Integrability,"ld return me an empty TTree, even though the job reported that it selected some events. For a while I was not able to find a handle on what triggered this problem, as it seemed quite random. (The same job would not always return empty trees.). I think I now understand what's going on. It has to do with the issue in TFileMerger that was discovered in ATLAS production jobs a long time ago. When TFileMerger is given multiple files, the first of which doesn't have any branches in it, the merged output file will not have any branches either. Even if the rest of the files given to TFileMerger did have some structure. In my PROOF jobs this happens because my code only sets up the format of its output TTree when it opens its first file. The output TTree format depends a bit on what branches are available on the input, so I can't do this any sooner. But PROOF in some cases will not process any events in some of its workers. When this happens, it's actually these workers that return their output files to the PROOF master first. Files which hold completely empty TTree-s. This made my jobs random, as PROOF would not always do this, sometimes (depending on the state of our cluster) it would actually process some events on all of the workers in this job. The problem can be demonstrated very easily. Attached is a macro that does this. (The macro was first written to demonstrate a problem with merging a file into a file on XRootD, but this issue doesn't depend on where the file is put.). While I may be able to circumvent the problem in my analysis code for now (by initializing the TTree format earlier in the code), this merging problem would be very good to solve. As I wrote at the beginning, the ATLAS production system also has to have extra code in place which knows not to give files with empty TTrees to hadd as the first file.

Integrability,"leView` advertises a defaulted move constructor, but unconditionally frees state in it's destructor causing a double free in the destructor of the second instance. This is caused by the call to `fField.DestroyValue(fValue);` in the dtor. `fValue` is copyable and moveable since the copy special member functions are not deleted, but contains pointers to allocated memory which are not duplicated during copies or transferred during a move (with leaving the moved from pointer `nullptr`) and thus shared between two instances of `RNTupleView`. Although the documentation of `RFieldValue`, the type of `fValue`, claims that the class owns no memory, the class receives a heap allocated value during the call chain of the constructor initialization list of `RNTupleView`: `fValue(fField.GenerateValue())`. Since the ownership model is convoluted to me, I cannot propose an easy fix. From the perspective of `RNTupleView`, `RFieldValue` would need a user-defined move ctor transferrign ownership of the heap-allocated pointer and `RNTupleView`'s dtor needs to be able to detect and handle a moved-from state. But the former is against the documented intent of the class, so I need to leave this to the designers of those classes :). ### Expected behavior; The move ctor of `RNTupleView` should let the dtors of both `RNTupleView` instances finish correctly. ### To Reproduce. Example:; ```c++; auto ntuple = RE::RNTupleReader::Open(RE::RNTupleModel::Create(), ""DecayTree"", ""B2HHH~none.ntuple"");; {; auto viewH1IsMuon = ntuple->GetView<int>(""H1_isMuon"");; {; auto copy{std::move(viewH1IsMuon)};; } // dtor for copy, frees shared state; } // dtor for viewH1IsMuon, double free; ```. I assume the problem does not depend on the input file, so it can probably be reproduced in a smaller setup. ### Setup; ```; bgruber@graviola:$ root --version; ROOT Version: 6.29/01; Built for linuxx8664gcc on Jan 16 2023, 14:47:00; From remotes/origin/HEAD@v6-29-01-212-gc8ad008463; ```; Built with g++-12 on Ubuntu 22.10.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12136:1735,depend,depend,1735,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12136,1,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,libNew is a custom memory allocator used in ROOT to output more information about memory pressure. It essentially overrides the new and delete operators. The functionality of libNew is only available in *rootn.exe* and libNew is statically linked to the binary. In root-project/root#4717 we discovered that dlopening libNew at random time can trigger earthquakes because it allows the dynamic linker to *sometimes* resolve new and delete to the symbols from libNew and libc++. Since libNew was not designed to be dlopened we should make it a static library to enforce this protocol more strongly.,MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4722:573,protocol,protocol,573,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4722,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

One of the overloads of the function abuses the logic of the class:. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/224551cf3fc5bdc80b2693578d082eb9cb0e32a3/tmva/tmva/src/DataLoader.cxx#L126-L133. In this overload a `DatasetInfo` object is created on the heap (as a temporary). Then `DatasetManager::AddDatasetInfo` takes the input argument as l-value ref and finally stores the `DatasetInfo` object as a shallow-reference in the internal `TList` data member `fDataSetInfoCollection`. This data member is not owning, thus at destruction time it will not take care of deleting its items. . https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/224551cf3fc5bdc80b2693578d082eb9cb0e32a3/tmva/tmva/src/DataSetManager.cxx#L105-L113. At the same time, the `DataSetInfo` object was created with `new` but never deleted. This logic is faulty and is related to the following report by valgrind:. ```; ==290973== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s); ==290973== at 0x2C720F3A: TMVA::DataLoader::AddTree(TTree*, TString const&, double, TCut const&, TMVA::Types::ETreeType) (DataLoader.cxx:360); ==290973== by 0x2C72113C: TMVA::DataLoader::AddSignalTree(TTree*, double, TMVA::Types::ETreeType) (DataLoader.cxx:373); ==290973== by 0x4F9573B: ???; ==290973== by 0x4F9107E: ???; ==290973== by 0x6EC8BCD: cling::IncrementalExecutor::executeWrapper(llvm::StringRef, cling::Value*) const (in /home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/rootbuild/fix-tutorial-tmva-cnn-classification-testing/lib/libCling.so); ==290973== by 0x6E4EA4E: cling::Interpreter::RunFunction(clang::FunctionDecl const*, cling::Value*) (in /home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/rootbuild/fix-tutorial-tmva-cnn-classification-testing/lib/libCling.so); ==290973== by 0x6E4F13C: cling::Interpreter::EvaluateInternal(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, cling::CompilationOptions, cling::Value*, cling::Transaction**, unsigned long) (in /home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/root",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14433:986,depend,depends,986,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14433,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"m name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++. The mechanism builds with cling a C++ wrapper class around Python callables and publishs them to the user. See following example for the basic mechanism. ```python; import ROOT. # Because C++ is strongly typed, we have to declare the types of the inputs and the output; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float""); def func(x):; return 2.0 * x. print(func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; print(ROOT.PyROOT.func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << PyROOT::func(1.0) << endl;"") # Prints 2.0; ```. This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(x):; return numpy.power(x, 2). df = ROOT.RDataFrame(4).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry_"").Define(""y"", ""PyROOT::func(x)""); npy = df.AsNumpy(); print(npy[""x""]) # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]; print(npy[""y""]) # Prints [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0]; ```. Finally, the approach is fully compatible with any custom C++ types you may have. ```python; import ROOT. ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; struct Foo {; static const int foo = 42;; };; """"""). @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""Foo""], """"); def func(x):; print(x.foo). ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""Foo x; PyROOT::func(x);"") # Prints 42; ```; There are still some things to check before merging:. - [ ] Double check reference counting; - [ ] C++ wrapper takes (lvalue) references, what happens with rvalues? What is the universal thingy?; - [ ] We put the C++ callable in the `PyROOT::` namespace. This is fine? It can be everything, even the global namespace.

Integrability,"mbinations of ROOT and ubuntu versions, finally it worked with ROOT 6.12.06 on Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS (gcc 5.4.0). . The main problem is remaining with the TMapFile which requires -lNew to be included in the makefile. Once this works, the TApplication just doesn't work with error message of segmentation fault or violation. Or vice versa, TApplication works but TMapFile doesn't work. In order to repeat the errors, I collected the three ROOT example macros (as attached) and created a makefile to compile them. In the Makefile, the option of --new or -lNew have been added. One can include them or comment them out. On Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (gcc 9.4.0), with ROOT version from 6.12.06 to 6.28.04, none of the combinations got to work. For instance, when the TMapFile works with ROOT 6.12.06, then the TApplication returns an error of ""Segmentation violation"". With a newer ROOT, e.g. 6.28.04, the TApplication works but the TMapFile got the error message; *****************************************************************************; Error in <TMapFile::TMapFile> : no memory mapped file capability available; Use rootn.exe or link application against ""-lNew""; *****************************************************************************. Could you guys have a look at this problem and find out what happened or may find a solution? Many thanks in advance. Huagen Xu from FZ Juelich, IKP; [root_examples.zip](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/12415948/root_examples.zip). ### Reproducer. As attached, there are three Macro files plus one Makefile. Those three files are all the ROOT examples to demostrate how the TMapFile as well as the TApplication work. To reproduce the problem described above, one could follow the tipps below.; 1. Unzip the file into a local directory ; 2. Open a terminal and cd to the unzipped directory, type ""make"" to compile the files; 3. Run ""./appdemo"" in a terminal to check whether TApplication works properly; 4.

Which results in the following bugs:. * If an element of `TSystemDirectory::GetListOfFiles()` is a file, its `IsDirectory()` will try to look for the file basename in the *current working directory* and produce the wrong result.; * As its perfectly legal to cast `TSystemDirectory *` to `TSystemFile *`, a `TSystemFile *tsysfFoo` with name ""foo"" and title ""foo"" could mean either; * A file with path `foo/foo`; * A directory with path `foo`, which was originally an instance of `TSystemDirectory *`. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->.

Integrability,"ms (not macOS), this makes the MPFE based parallelization a lot faster by pinning processes to physical CPU cores.; 3. To accomodate the new minimization frameworks, RooMinimizer was changed quite a bit as well. It is still backwards compatible, but the new functionality can be accessed through a new `create` template factory function. This template function allows users to pass in their own calculation back-ends, e.g. for calculating on GPUs or in autograd enabled frameworks. The commit history also contains the proof of concept version, the benchmark results of which were presented at [ACAT19](https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/contributions/3276177/) and [CHEP19](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202024506027) (and [preliminary results at the 2018 ROOT Users workshop in Sarajevo](https://indico.cern.ch/event/697389/contributions/3062028/)). That version was redesigned starting from 2019 to better integrate with the rest of the code and at the same time untangle the test statistics classes to conceptually bring them closer to the math, instead of the more implementation-detail oriented existing design (RooAbsTestStatistic et al.).

Integrability,"n == 1`. This fixes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` on `mac13arm`, but makes it fail on x86 (didn't investigate why). It also makes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fail (both on `mac13arm` and x86) - this test looks even worse in terms of floating point arithmetic, since it expects summing up two partitions individually and then adding the result being bitwise identical to summing up the whole range at once. From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. > Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. See above; the additional problem is that the (optimizing) compiler will insert FMA operations if it sees fit (and is allowed to do so). So depending on how the code and the arithmetic operations are formulated, you may get different results depending on platform, software versions, optimization level, hardware, etc. > Or, even more problematically, could such FMA operations also cause similar rounding errors on x86 so that EXPECT_EQ indeed becomes impossible (and I just got lucky with the current parameters on x86)?. On x86, you are saved by the fact that, as far as I can tell, FMA instructions only come from some SIMD extension that the compiler cannot use unconditionally. This is different on AArch64 (and apparently also PPC64LE) where it appears it is in the base ISA and always available. But yes, if in the future FMA is always available on x86 or you compile (parts of) the code with vector instructions (`RooBatchCompute`, hint hint), you can potentially run into the same problem. For another point regarding ""lucky"", see above that adding the `extendedTerm` to the last partition already makes one other test fail...

Integrability,"n help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_types.h`: maybe we could replace this with @guitargeek's new configuration structs.; 4. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test. Finally, one thing that in an ideal world I would have liked to do is add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, I'm rather short on time right now, and these things almost always tend to take longer than one expects, so I'm hesitant to build it now. The **advantage** would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the `MultiProcess` minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in [""PR 7"" (see overview)](https://whimsical.com/roofit-multiprocess-teststatistics-pr-dependencies-QP47k9PyS24VuboQUP5W6P). So, up for discussion, two choices: **A:** add ""`LikelihoodGradientSerial`"" class (based on `RooGradMinimizerFcn`) so we can add an integration test in this PR; **B:** wait for the integration test in PR 7.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700:3180,depend,dependencies-,3180,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700,3,"['depend', 'integrat']","['dependencies-', 'integration']"

Integrability,"n prefer to have a run-time option and I think I have a solution that satisfies everyone. This is implemented in my latest patch https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator. Filtering is not implemented in a very efficient way to keep the code sim",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580:1006,message,messages,1006,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580,1,['message'],['messages']
Integrability,"n the 2nd run). The issue here (well there https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10743) does not seems to be the 2nd running of EndOfProcessCleanups but rather that there is a bad interaction between the 'early' running of the cleanups and that something in RDataFrame is not properly informed that something is delete early. The early cleanups is necessary because of the following issue. * The python code (directly or indirectly) can load libraries (Ls); * The python code (directly or indirectly) can open TFile (Fs) and can elect to never delete them; * The python code (directly or indirectly) can attach objects based on the Libraries on to the TFile. Then the order of execution at tear down will be. (1) tear down python; (2) unload the loaded libraries (Ls); (3) execute the atexit registered by TROOT, ; (4) this includes EndOfProcessCleanups; (5) this includes flushing and closing the TFiles. During (5) the object attached the TFile (usually just histogram and `TTree` but can also be object from the user libraries. However if the libraries for the user objects are already unloaded, their code (including a Streamer function or even their dictionary) are gone and this result in crash at best or worse in data loss. In order to prevent that we introduced (in https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/7a592f5d62dda6c76f230bfa6fd879e5fa80582a and friends), running the `EndOfProcessCleanups` of cleanups as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as we can detect the process is starting to tear down). (i.e. make it part of (1)). More likely that not this means than rather than removing early this call to `EndOfProcessCleanups`, the solution is to inform `RDataFrame` of those early deletion (depending whether the things that are deleted that are annoying `RDataFrame`, they may or may not be having the trouble described above, so another solution might be to insure that the things that bother `RDataFrame` are not included in the list of things deleted by `EndOfProcessCleanups`)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10753#issuecomment-1155610874:1835,depend,depending,1835,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10753#issuecomment-1155610874,1,['depend'],['depending']

There, by commenting the template declaration of the move constructor, one can see the corresponding AST definition data being filled, i.e. from; > ; > ```; > | | |-MoveConstructor; > ```; > ; > to; > ; > ```; > | | |-MoveConstructor exists non_trivial user_declared; > ```; > ; > I am surely not expert enough in this area, but I noticed that when the constructor is templated the corresponding `CXXConstructorDecl` is nested inside a `FunctionTemplateDecl`, so that may be ""hiding"" it somehow?. I suppose that with a template move constructor is not the ""canonical form"" of a move constructor (or whatever the right standardese is). I was hoping that it's reported once the template is instantiated, but that doesn't seem the case either. In any case, what you really want to ask Clang is ""can you copy-construct this thing"" and ""can you move-construct this thing"". That logic is implemented in `EvaluateBooleanTypeTrait` of `SemaExprCXX.cpp` and is indeed a bit hairy because it actually has to run through all the machinery of template instantiation and overload resolution. You can invoke that machinery via `Sema::BuildTypeTrait` with `Kind = clang::TT_IsConstructible`. Alternatively, you can try using the `__is_constructible` builtin in the generated wrapper code, but I'm not sure how that would work because it's not available in the preprocessor... Final remark: A better heuristic could be to check for [`defaultedCopyConstructorIsDeleted()`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CXXRecordDecl.html#a6cd5ebd1006eab239a19413c2886dab3) and then just try the `std::move`. I think that heuristic still has false-negatives and false-positives, but I think it gets the one case right where the explicit intent is to `delete` the copy constructor...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14426#issuecomment-1918556597:2892,wrap,wrapper,2892,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14426#issuecomment-1918556597,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"next 10 years. I see this can be an issue if we start shipping module files (`bmi`s or equivalent) instead of header files. However, in practice that won't be the case in near future because the compiler vendors cannot agree on a common file format and make it standard. Until then, there will be always some sort of a textual header file which can be processed with our clang-based rootcling and build a pcm file as basis for our dictionaries. . > My request is for the upcoming ROOT with Clang 16 to be able to accommodate the generation and use of PCM dictionaries where dependencies thereof are or use C++20 modules. Clang has at least 5 different ""flavors"" of modules. One of them is the C++20 modules as described by the C++ standard. At the moment you start using C++ 20 you could use the `import`/`export` constructs and you will be able to use that feature for encapsulation purposes. There is not enough project transitions which are bigger than toy examples. One of the challenges is how we discover module dependencies. That is, we need extra tooling to decide how to split the source files into modules. In practice we need to pre-lex all of the content before the build system can start processing project files. The community is discussing scanners (such as clang scan-deps), daemons (the gcc implementation), protocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248).

Integrability,"of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages. I did this only when two messages printed the same information in succession.; * In a few cases, I changed debug output so that variables are printed in one line that were printed in several lines. A log is easier to grep and scroll through when variables are on the same line as the prefix.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799:1725,message,messages,1725,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799,4,['message'],['messages']

Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3.

Then, configure from the build dir with `cmake .. -Dtesting=ON` (actually, I was configuring with `cmake .. -Droofit_multiprocess=ON -Dminuit2=ON -Dtesting=ON`, but probably the first two options are not necessary). Build with `make` and it should crash, with the logs showing the above quoted messages. ### Setup; 1. ROOT version: master; 2. Operating system: CentOS 7; 3.

The Python `RuntimeError` in turn is just a wrapper of the C++ `std::runtime_error` which comes from [this function](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/bc6c4d327bf0b6c78aff0e9622f959441c480d8e/tree/dataframe/src/RDFUtils.cxx#L335-L342) in the RDF machinery. That error suggests a failure in `TInterpreter::Calc`, which should be visible with some kind of output to stderr showing the compilation error. Unfortunately, stderr is completely empty, no error is shown by `TInterpreter`. By adding a bunch of print statements here and there, we can get to see some more details of this issue (the patch will be attached). ```; Failure in cling::IncrementalExecutor::jitInitOrWrapper: PID=31643,funcname=_Z16__cling_Un1Qu340Pv.

Integrability,"oofit/roofitcore/src/RooAddPdf.cxx#L825-L840; where Clang now optimizes the inlined `RooArgList::at`:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e8ba1328693f89af8299904ce3db7bdc8f57c535/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h#L109-L116; and removes the `return nullptr` in case of range errors. The reasoning is that `RooAddPdf::checkObservables` calls a member function on `pdf`, so it being `nullptr` is UB and can be optimized out, and dereferences `coef`, which is also UB on a `nullptr` (although it works because `RooAbsArg::observableOverlaps` takes a reference, ie no pointer dereference actually takes place). If I remove the `return nullptr` statically in the code like; ```diff; diff --git a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; index c5a49bd1b6..bb4afbd12d 100644; --- a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; +++ b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; @@ -109,9 +109,6 @@ public:; /// Return object at given index, or nullptr if index is out of range; inline RooAbsArg* at(Int_t idx) const {. - if (idx >= static_cast<Int_t>(_list.size())); - return nullptr;; -; return _list[idx];; }. ```; I see the same crash happening with GCC. What I see with a debugger is that `_pdfList` has size 2 while `_coefList` has size 1, so the second iteration of the loop passes `nullptr` for `coef`. This is ""filtered out"" later in `RooAbsArg::dependsOn` where `ignoreArg` is also `nullptr` and things magically work. So, @guitargeek, there are a number of possibilities:; 1. Modify the loop to only run until `std::min(_pdfList.size(), _coefList.size()`.; 2. Add explicit `nullptr` checks for `pdf` and `coef` before calling `observableOverlaps` so the compiler cannot optimize them out.; 3. Make `observableOverlaps` take a pointer that can be `nullptr` and deal with it later on. However, is it actually valid that there are fewer coefficients than pdfs? As far as I understand `RooAddPdf` as a sum of pdfs, that sounds wrong and points to some other code having a problem!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535:1658,depend,dependsOn,1658,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535,1,['depend'],['dependsOn']

(ie for a pointer you get nullptr, for a signed integer or floating point type you get -1, and for an unsigned integer you get the max value because it wraps... To make matters worse, because the error is never caught in LookupHelper, the decl is never cleaned up, so if you try to lookup the function again, it will again spuriously succeed, but this time won't even emit the clang errors. In terms of solutions, it would be best if the lookup fails in this case, but aside from that, probably cppyy should throw an exception rather than returning a default value at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/180c8099bfb6ad753b8a698445351662f8c5ef1f/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy-backend/clingwrapper/src/clingwrapper.cxx#L814 (and in several of the related functions). The exception would be caught here and should properly translate into a python exception: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/180c8099bfb6ad753b8a698445351662f8c5ef1f/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/CPyCppyy/src/CPPMethod.cxx#L73-L75 .

Integrability,"ore sense. Also, it just hasn't been tested at all with Minuit 1, I'm not even sure it will work with that version. Other than these `RooMinimizer` changes and the addition of `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new test was added called `testRooGradMinimizer`. It also uses a `test_lib.h` header that will also be used later on in tests of other new likelihood minimization implementations. **Do note that the test currently fails.** I originally had carefully made sure the results were bit-wise exactly the same as those from using classic `RooMinimizerFcn`, but there must have been some change in the meantime that I have not been able to integrate yet. I suspect it is caused by a change in Kahan summation, but have to inspect. In any case, the results are minor differences that do not negatively affect the effectiveness, the minimization just takes slightly different paths to the end results that will agree within the desired precision when set high enough. ~~**Final note:** this PR depends on three others: #8369, #8567 and #8569. These branches as they currently are were merged into this branch before making the one commit that adds everything in this actual commit. Do not merge this one before those. Also take care that this branch will be rebased and force pushed after each of those three are merged. In short: probably it will be easier to review this branch after those others are merged. However, of course, a review is already most welcome. Just make sure to only look at the diff from the final commit: https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/6b129bedf5f6fe2e971c0a24fce0bf53e6c40284~~. **Update**: two of the above dependency PRs were merged. Only #8567 still needs to be merged and hence is also still included in this PR to make it compile. I have marked these three `math/minuit2` files with a review comment. All the other files actually do belong to this PR.

Integrability,"ou can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. If RooFitZMQ only makes sense as a support library for RooFit::MultiProcess, it's better to put them together in a single pull request. It will be much easier to ensure everything works together that way.; ; > I think that fail-on-missing is only relevant in case there would be a non built-in option as well, right?. That is not what users generally think. They want `fail-on-missing` to work reliably and make configuration fail if a dependency cannot be met with system packages. The only exceptions to this rule should be LLVM/Clang.; ; > Finally, about git history: makes sense. I can do some reordering before merging. Otherwise, just squashing everything would make sense to me as well. The two independent things here are basically 1) the zmq builtin and 2) RooFitZMQ itself. These could indeed just be two commits, but since nothing really depends on RooFitZMQ at this point, including it with the libzmq builtin in one commit I think would give a clean history as well.

Integrability,"owing of declarations in the `std` namespace. In summary, given that ROOT issues an implicit `using namespace std;` and due to the way `SemaLookup` works, decls that shadow something in the `std` namespace cannot be referenced without using their fully-qualified name, i.e. `::xxx`.; See discussion in ROOT-5971 for the details. This pull-request improves the situation by emitting a warning for that case. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `Interpreter::m_InputFlags`, which provides additional information about the context in which parsing occurs. In particular, the `kInputFromFile` and `kIFFLineByLine` flags allow to tell whether a sequence of calls to `Interpreter::process()` is issued from `MetaProcessor::readInputFromFile()` for the contents of an external file.; - Update cling's DefinitionShadower to emit a warning if a new declaration shadows a name in the `std` namespace (that became available via the implicit `using namespace std`). This diagnostic is disabled for unnamed macros, as input is typically ingested in a single `process()` call, which makes all the variables local to the generated wrapper. . This requires to change the lookup redeclaration kind to `NotForRedeclaration`, which has a performance penalty, given that the lookup will follow using directives, etc. This is approximately one order of magnitude slower than `ForVisibleRedeclaration` (see table below). The overhead seems acceptable given that this kind of lookup already occurs when a declaration is referenced and that definition is rare w.r.t. use.; ```; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; | Redeclaration kind | Time (us) for 1000000 lookups |; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; | ForVisibleRedeclaration | 27617 |; | NotForRedeclaration | 717458 |; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; ```. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally.

Since only the server can create/destroy clients, there is no need to throw.

Integrability,"place in the existing memory buffers). For example - primitives and lists of primitives are supported; anything needing references are not. Despite the fact many of ROOT's very useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:. * A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; * A TTreeReader-like interface, TTreeReaderFast. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize and apply user code, rather than two.; * The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by TDataFrame, provided we can make TDataFrame sufficiently fast.; * A Python-based numpy export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; * The numpy interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur.

Integrability,"ppCallable([""float""], ""string"", verbose=True); # 2) Falls back to generic impl and prints ""42"" (as string); ```. **DEPRECATED:**. I've cleaned up and improved the feature. Here's the basic workflow now:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float""); def f(x); return 2.0 * x. # General use-cases; ROOT.ROOT.f(21) # Returns 42; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << ROOT::f(21.0) << endl;"") # Prints 42.0. # Inject callable into dataframe; df = ROOT.ROOT.RDataFrame(10).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry__"").Define(""ROOT::f(x)""); ```. The `DeclareCallable` dispatches between numba and the generic implementation. It tries to compile the thingy with numba (falls through silently) and otherwise tries the generic implementation (fails noisily).; However, you can force using the generic implementation or numba by using the decorators `DeclareGenericCallable` and `DeclareNumbaCallable`. The interface is exactly the same than for the general `DeclareCallable` decorator. In addition, you can now give the wrapped function a custom name:. ```python; @ROOT.DeclareCallable([""float""], ""float"", ""my_name""); def f(x):; return 2.0 * x. ROOT.ROOT.my_name(21) # Returns 42; ```. **DEPRECATED:**. Add workflow to invoke Python callables from C++. The mechanism builds with cling a C++ wrapper class around Python callables and publishs them to the user. See following example for the basic mechanism. ```python; import ROOT. # Because C++ is strongly typed, we have to declare the types of the inputs and the output; @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""float""], ""float""); def func(x):; return 2.0 * x. print(func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; print(ROOT.PyROOT.func(1.0)) # Prints 2.0; ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""cout << PyROOT::func(1.0) << endl;"") # Prints 2.0; ```. This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(x):; return numpy.power(x, 2). df = ROOT.RDataFrame(4).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488:2328,wrap,wrapped,2328,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488,1,['wrap'],['wrapped']

Moreover the exit code is 0, which typically means successful completion of a process.; When merging multiple sets of files it is possible to miss the printed messages. I don't know of any way of automating the process of detecting the issues. ### Describe the solution you'd like; I believe the operation would be much more robust if; 1. hadd produced no output file if any issues with the input files are encountered, except when option `-k` is provided explicitly; 2. hadd generates exit code different from 0 if any issues with input files are encountered. ### Describe alternatives you've considered; Alternative solution is of course avoiding the errors to occur and checking for them separately. ### Additional context; Input ROOT files were produced with ROOT version 5.34.32, but I can use more modern versions of hadd to merge them.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8952:2503,message,messages,2503,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8952,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"r element access; - `PushProxy()`, `PopProxy()`: for selecting the target object.

Integrability,"r::operator++()` will throw. This would shorten the stack trace shown by a potential crash to; ```; ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++(); UserCode::modelBackground(); ```; - we would not know the stack trace that actually triggered the exception. We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime library implementations (but ABI break). **TL;DR**:; I agree that exceptions instead of error codes allow for nicer code. I don't think that we can have that nice code when we introduce `RStatus`, because the developer of that code must not assume a state for ""immediate exceptions"". In the end, we cannot use exceptions (across frames returning `RStatus`) and need to handle the error state, *always*. That leaves missing stack frames versus manipulation of a global (with developers dangerously and tacitly assuming a default state) - where IMHO it's more robust to have a mechanism to supply the missing stack frames (which can then - even better! - include user-facing diagnostic messages rather than just function names).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730:3082,message,messages,3082,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"raries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve; symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it; already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"".; Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU *would* dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate; immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the; dlopen ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300:1575,depend,depending,1575,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"replace the calling site (in `flexibleInterp`) with. ```; // return total * std::exp(interpolate6thDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:1030,message,message,1030,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"ressions. I discarded that because of two reasons:; - They are more costly that simple string comparison.; - They complicate the registration of pythonizors per scope. In this new `@pythonization` decorator, the scope of the class is parsed (e.g. `NS1::NS2` for `NS1::NS2::C`) and the pythonizor is _registered for that scope_. This allows for more efficient lookup of the pythonizors to apply, because when a class is accessed for the first time, only the pythonizors registered for its scope will be attempted. This is nice for user classes, because if a user class belongs to `UserNamespace`, when the user script first accesses the class only the pythonizors for classes in `UserNamespace` will be tried, and not every single registered pythonizor (in particular, not all the pythonizors ROOT registers for its classes in the global namespace). So I prefer to have a clean static prefix that unambiguously tells me what the target scope is than something like `NS1::(.+)::C`. And if the user wants to do an additional complex matching with regular expressions, they can still do so in their pythonizor code via the `name` parameter. I'd like to hear the opinion of @pikacic and @daritter about this since we've discussed about this decorator in the past (no need to review the whole PR, giving your opinion on the programming examples is already more than enough!). EDIT: I have received some feedback from @eguiraud on the `name` parameter: he thinks it could be removed since some users won't need it (they won't do any further filtering inside the pythonizor). As an alternative, `name` could be injected in `klass` before the user pythonizor runs (so users would access it as `klass.name`), but that could cause a clash if `name` is already a static member of the class. There is also `klass.__cpp_name__` that is provided by cppyy with the fully qualified name of the class, so we could rely on that too. @vepadulano would rather keep `name` as a parameter. I'd like to hear more opinions :)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9128:3849,inject,injected,3849,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9128,1,['inject'],['injected']

Integrability,"rial which shows the use of the new VoigtRelativistic class two produce two plots, comparing relativistic voigt to non relativistic voigt, both as the voigt itself and their dumping functions.; Files modified:; math/mathmore/CMakeLists.txt; math/mathmore/inc/Math/LinkDef.h - These two files needed to be modified to compile my changes adding in the relativisitc voigt. **Full description**; Implemented relativistic version of voigt (non-relativistic case already exists in TMath). As previously discussed in the ROOT forum https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/relativistic-breit-wigner-and-relativistic-voigt/48844 , the relativistic version has been added to mathmore rather than TMath, as it requires including a header file with an integrator which is CPU intensive. This has hence been added as it's own class in mathmore, with two functions:. static double evaluate(double x, double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);; static double dumpingFunction(double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);. The default integrationRange was chosen as the integral has been wrote in a form where it is multiplied by exp(-t^2), and this value of integrationRange results in going to the point where exp(-t^2) reaches the minimum value stored by a double. A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute. This is shown in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09304.pdf equation 9 which has been used here. I am unsure how referencing works with ROOT. [Note: the function used here is not actually identical to equation 9, as the paper linked uses a different normalization than ROOT does for the non relativistic voigt which is already implemented in TMath.

New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn‚Äôt seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn‚Äôt able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM‚Äôs automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don‚Äôt actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you‚Äôd like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub. #### How do I know this PR is legitimate?; This PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announced on the official GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/).

Integrability,"rotocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248). The reasons we cannot make it yet default is discussed here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/41810#issuecomment-1578982627 and here https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13000 Not surprisingly we have observed similar comments coming from modularization efforts in gcc and msvc. . Let's assume we live in an platonic world where all of the above is resolved. It still seems we will be able to use our dictionary system as it is because we will in the end have a build system that processes textual files to build them. There we could use any custom flavor of modules (or something better) that makes our I/O work. We can go one step further and claim that, even if we introduce strict interface encapsulation via C++ 20 modules, our I/O system would require to know more about the non-exported entities so that we can serialize and deserialize the private dependencies of the exported entities. That is, we will probably end up with a very similar system that we have today. I would personally like to tackle the engineering challenge as you have described. However I believe we are not there yet and any efforts into trying to adapt to a still volatile area would probably cause disturbances in our user base for not yet clear final goal.

Integrability,"rprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.). The reason I blame the dictionary generation code is that regular C(\+\+) code building with Ninja scales very well to many cores. Even when one has many small libraries in a project, Ninja can start the build of object files before all of the libraries that they depend on would've finished building. (In ATLAS's offline software the very end of a build is taken up purely by library/executable linking steps.). ## To Reproduce. Unfortunately you need a pretty powerful machine to do so... But once you do, just do something similar to what I did:. ```; cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \; -Dall=ON -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432:1871,depend,depends,1871,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"rrors, warnings, and debug info. Some of these only work when certain compile flags are set (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). I would like to unify these systems and use the MnPrint facilities consistently everywhere. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros.

Integrability,"ry useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:; - A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; - A `TTreeReader`-like interface, `TTreeReaderFast`. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize *and* apply user code, rather than two.; - The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by `TDataFrame`, provided we can make `TDataFrame` sufficiently fast.; - A Python-based `numpy` export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; - The `numpy` interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur. So indeed, lot's of experimental / internal interface work here - but we felt that (a) a sufficient amount depends on this and (b) we've demonstrated enough utility that it was time to start talking about merging.

Integrability,"s is typically set during initialization, usually using `TClass::CopyCollectionProxy()` or similar. In this pull request, we introduce support for legacy collection proxies derived from the `TVirtualCollectionProxy` class, although in later stages, RNTuple might provide this functionality through an interface different interface. At a bare minimum, the user is required to provide an implementation for the following functions in `TVirtualCollectionProxy`:; - `HasPointers()`, `GetProperties()`, `GetValueClass()`, `GetType()`, `Sizeof()`: for general information about the collection and its value type.; - `Sizeof()`, `At()`, `Clear()`, and `Insert()`: for element access; - `PushProxy()`, `PopProxy()`: for selecting the target object. A usage example can be seen [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11525/files#diff-81832cd72f5d9af1508fd153abdf63b6406256248f1d1440f966e82e628da141). ## Changes or fixes:; - Added class `RCollectionClassField`, representing a field of a user-defined class that behaves as a collection that is compliant with the `TVirtualCollectionProxy` interface.; Given that the `RField<T>` primary template definition (that used if no specialization matches) uses `RClassField` to store members of a class, we rely on an additional helper type (`IsCollectionProxy<T>`) to annotate that a particular class has an associated collection proxy (see example below).; ```c++; // Alternatively, this can be specified via a member type in the user-defined class; see the documentation; template <>; struct IsCollectionProxy<ProxiedCollection> : std::true_type {};. auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto fieldKlass = model->MakeField<MyClass>(""fieldKlass""); // Regular class; auto fieldCollection = model->MakeField<ProxiedCollection>(""fieldCollection""); // Class with associated collection proxy; ```; **This tag is not required when using the type-erased interface** (i.e., `RFieldBase::Create()`), as the use of a collection proxy can be determined at run time vi",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11525:1446,interface,interface,1446,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11525,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"s modified:; math/mathmore/CMakeLists.txt; math/mathmore/inc/Math/LinkDef.h - These two files needed to be modified to compile my changes adding in the relativisitc voigt. **Full description**; Implemented relativistic version of voigt (non-relativistic case already exists in TMath). As previously discussed in the ROOT forum https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/relativistic-breit-wigner-and-relativistic-voigt/48844 , the relativistic version has been added to mathmore rather than TMath, as it requires including a header file with an integrator which is CPU intensive. This has hence been added as it's own class in mathmore, with two functions:. static double evaluate(double x, double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);; static double dumpingFunction(double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);. The default integrationRange was chosen as the integral has been wrote in a form where it is multiplied by exp(-t^2), and this value of integrationRange results in going to the point where exp(-t^2) reaches the minimum value stored by a double. A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute. This is shown in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09304.pdf equation 9 which has been used here. I am unsure how referencing works with ROOT. [Note: the function used here is not actually identical to equation 9, as the paper linked uses a different normalization than ROOT does for the non relativistic voigt which is already implemented in TMath. I have renormalized this equation to be consistent with the non relativistic case already in ROOT). The two functions that have been defined are:. evaluate, simply gives the value of the relativisitic voigt at the point requested; dumpingFunction, this is a commonly used functio",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049:1883,integrat,integrationRange,1883,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049,2,['integrat'],['integrationRange']

Integrability,"says ""Add **a** module for experimental/string_view""; The commit says:. That should fix a recent nightly failure with gcc11 avoiding to require; module ""bits/ranges_base.h"" in C++20 context. The code says:; ```; module ""experimental/string_view"" {; export *; header ""experimental/algorithm""; }; ```; ; The commit content as-is seems completely unrelated to the commit log as far as I could tell (without doing research on the relationship between `range_base`, `string_view` and `algorithm`.; ; So I pondered whether the fix was the right fix for a problem I did not know anything about ... ; ; The right thing to do would have probably be have been to request a complete explanation of what the original problem was, what was the mechanism leading to the error and why this solution was the best solution. This was obviously much more than this seemingly simple fix required. So instead I thought to ask for a very low cost, straight forward solution: simply copy/pasting the error with no additional effort to explain in detail. > Can you suggest a commit message which adds enough information which makes me happy as well?. That requires to paraphrase the error and add a few more details. ```; That should fix a recent nightly failure with gcc11. The failure presented during dictionary generation in a C++14 and C++17 build and incorrectly complained about needing the 'cplusplus20' feature for the 'std.bits/ranges_base.h' module. The issue was triggered by an inclusion of `<bits/ranges_base.h>` from `string_view`. This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). . It seems the issue is solved by exporting `algorithm` as part of the `string_view` module.; ```. Actually, I still don't know why adding `algorithm` fixes a problem with `range_base.h`, so I can't add that to the commit ... maybe it is something like ""... by avoiding to use the module maps provided by the standard library in those case""?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12276#issuecomment-1430326540:1111,message,message,1111,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12276#issuecomment-1430326540,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"so .... in short your right and the patch does not go far enough. historically TTreeProcessor[MT] was (one of) the first to use multi-threading on TFile. TFile::ReadProcessID was found to be performance/scaling critical so much so that it lead to the introduction of the SpinLocks and the ReadWrite locks ... and at the time there was no point in having the lock taken when that code was not active ... Obviously this is no longer the case. The extension of the use case means that actually we need to protect TFile::ReadProcessID from other use of the TProcessID interfaces (the only other direct user of the collection ```TProcessID::GetPIDs```. This means that we should probably no longer rely on ```TFile::ReadProcessID``` using its own lock. .

Integrability,"ssages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). For wrappers like iminuit, it is important to redirect the log to its own streams that can be readout and displayed in Python, for example in a Jupyter notebook session (std::cerr and std::cout always go to the terminal and are invisible in a Jupyter notebook).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:3682,rout,routines,3682,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,8,"['message', 'rout', 'wrap']","['messages', 'routines', 'wrappers']"

Integrability,"state would allow us to throw an exception in `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()`. But `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()` might want/need to handle the error state, e.g. by retrying, or by accessing alternative sources. It might even be that a partial read is modeled as an error. This would require `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` to force the ""immediate exception"" state to a certain value and reset it later - which is error prone and awkward; it shows that we use a global state that needs local knowledge. If ""immediate exception"" is false and `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` captures the error and returns it, same for all subsequent frames but `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` (which cannot return a `RStatus`), then only `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` will throw. This would shorten the stack trace shown by a potential crash to; ```; ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++(); UserCode::modelBackground(); ```; - we would not know the stack trace that actually triggered the exception. We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime libr",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730:1423,message,message,1423,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"t is able to provide data from SQlite `SELECT` queries. It will be useful for cvmfs, where we have file catalogs and monitoring information in sqlite files. For instance, one can do. auto rdf = ROOT::RDF::MakeSqliteDataFrame(""catalog.sqlite"", ""select * from catalog"");; auto h = rdf.Define(""lname"", ""name.length()"").Histo1D(""lname"");. to show the distribution of file name sizes. There are probably more use cases, for instance sqlite export of conditions data. This is work in progress, I'm posting it for early comments and feedback. My open points are. - Unit and integration tests are yet to be done; - The data source work single-threaded only at the moment. I initially thought it might be enough to return only a single row in `GetEntryRanges()` to make it thread-safe but that's apparently not enough. So I'm now thinking to wrap `SetEntry()` and `GetEntryRanges()` in a mutex.; - The code is not reusing `TSQLiteServer`. It felt like it requires stretching the `TSQLServer` interface in perhaps unwanted ways, for saving only a handful of direct sqlite API calls. On the other hand, with (probably quite a bit) more work it might be possible to have a more general data source that works on any SQL result set.; - Determining column types in SQlite is tricky as it is dynamically typed and in principle each row can have different column types. If a table column is queried as is, I can use the default/declared column type. For expressions, I'll use the type of the first row of the result set. Still it can result in a column to be of type `NULL` where subsequent rows actually have meaningful values. My guess is that the current heuristic is practical enough, and of course the user can formulate the `SELECT` query to avoid ambiguity.; - It would not be impossible to add support for remote reading of sqlite files. To do so, one can add a custom implementation of an sqlite virtual file system to have data pouring in directly from HTTP or XRootD. This is perhaps something to keep in m",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2322:1034,interface,interface,1034,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2322,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"t's mostly getting rid of unnecessary classes. The user-facing interfaces are stable (to be proven by the fact that all the rest of RooFit still compiles, and that tutorials run).; This is the chance to modernise/improve the `RooCategory` interface. It would be nice if you could specifically look at `RooCategory.h`, maybe in conjunction with the modernised tutorial on how they can be used in the future:; https://github.com/hageboeck/root/blob/cleanupCategories/tutorials/roofit/rf404_categories.C.

This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Convert RooVectorDataStore from saving RooCatType to integers of; category states.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore. - Provide new interfaces for categories to work without RooCatType.; - Prevent clearing of shapeDirty in RooAbsCategory::evaluate(), since; derived category classes might need to recompute their shapes if one; of their input categories change.; - Add function to define multiple category states at once with; initialiser lists. - Mark legacy interfaces exposing RooCatType as deprecated in doxygen.; - Stop including RooCatType when R__LESS_INCLUDES is set.; - Flag legacy interface with R__SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE.; - Create RooCatType instances on-demand in case users continue to use; the legacy interface. - Consolidate RooMultiCategory and RooSuperCategory. These share almost; all the code, so RooSuperCategory will now use a RooMultiCategory for; state definition and retrieval. The only additional functionality for; RooSuperCategory is that it can assign states to its subcategories. - Replace ineffective assert(0) by throws.; - Deprecate RooCategorySharedProperties, replace by a shared_ptr to a; map of allowed ranges.; - Dep",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219:1585,interface,interfaces,1585,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

In user's machine, I think it is unlikely that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset because if ROOT is successfully installed in the machine, they should be set. Thus I'm not 100% sure that we should add DynamicPath to search because it causes overhead in the lookup.; 2. Instead, I think we can change Clang code to abort when it generates implicit modules on-demand and emit error messages.

Integrability,"tead I have a tuple or list on the Python side and the template expects some STL container? Then it can not just be that STL container of say `T*`, but also the STL container of pointer any of the base classes, or worse, a mix thereof. And what if the tuple isn't actually targeting a container, but is an initalizer_list? There is often no (relevant) type information available at that point in Python, but many cases can still be resolved b/c the C++ side has some hints. For example `template<typename T, int N> void func(const std::array<T, N>&)` being given a Python tuple `(1, 2, 3)`. Absolutely clear what needs to be done for the conversion to work, but otherwise yet another case to add to the combinatorics. The above, current, situation is very much ""eeew"" and ""might not like the result."" It has also reached its breaking point, as you can see from the open bug reports and the constant hacking on workarounds. I appreciate that for the old PyROOT no-one actually seriously used templates, as folks avoided it in their interfaces b/c of non-support in the CINT world. The only client with moderately interesting templates would be RDataFrame. But in the real world, folks write modern C++ and template usage is much more pervasive. Just last week, I was looking at a massive series of variadically templated constructors: each peeled of an argument to eventually initialize a grand total of 3 data members. It was just a struct with an `unsigned int`, a `double`, and an `std::array<double, 3>`. The point of the whole set of constructors being that you can use initializer syntax with the data member in every order, either the ""naked"" types or with casts of explicitly named typedefs. Oh, it works _now_, with yet another workaround, but it actually crashed `lookupHelper` (segfault and die; and it's not the only one; I have a few more for Vassil, e.g. lookup in an unnamed namespace also crashes deep, deep inside Cling/Clang). So, I consider that another strong argument against ""tryi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696889449:2491,interface,interfaces,2491,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696889449,1,['interface'],['interfaces']
