For further details, please see; the discussion of the NoAlias response in :ref:`alias analysis <Must, May,; or No>`. Note that this definition of ``noalias`` is intentionally similar; to the definition of ``restrict`` in C99 for function arguments.

Furthermore, the semantics of the ``noalias``; attribute on return values are stronger than the semantics of the attribute; when used on function arguments.

See; ``DW_AT_LLVM_iterations`` in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-low-level-information`. 2.20 DWARF Operation to Create Runtime Overlay Composite Location Description; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------. It is common in SIMD vectorization for the compiler to generate code that; promotes portions of an array into vector registers. For example, if the; hardware has vector registers with 8 elements, and 8 wide SIMD instructions, the; compiler may vectorize a loop so that is executes 8 iterations concurrently for; each vectorized loop iteration. On the first iteration of the generated vectorized loop, iterations 0 to 7 of; the source language loop will be executed using SIMD instructions. Then on the; next iteration of the generated vectorized loop, iteration 8 to 15 will be; executed, and so on. If the source language loop accesses an array element based on the loop; iteration index, the compiler may read the element into a register for the; duration of that iteration. Next iteration it will read the next element into; the register, and so on. With SIMD, this generalizes to the compiler reading; array elements 0 to 7 into a vector register on the first vectorized loop; iteration, then array elements 8 to 15 on the next iteration, and so on. The DWARF location description for the array needs to express that all elements; are in memory, except the slice that has been promoted to the vector register.; The starting position of the slice is a runtime value based on the iteration; index modulo the vectorization size. This cannot be expressed by ``DW_OP_piece``; and ``DW_OP_bit_piece`` which only allow constant offsets to be expressed. Therefore, a new operator is defined that takes two location descriptions, an; offset and a size, and creates a composite that effectively uses the second; location description as an overlay of the first, positioned according to the; offs",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:35567,access,accesses,35567,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;. Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent pointers; won't be dereferenced?*. The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to perform the; computation. The second operand to the GEP instruction must be a value of a; pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:2117,access,accessed,2117,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['access'],['accessed']
Security,"usses the key designs of ``-fbounds-safety``. The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true. In the example below, pointer ``p``; annotated with ``__counted_by(count)`` must always point to a memory buffer; containing at least ``count`` elements of the pointee type. Changing the value; of ``count``, like in the example below, may violate this invariant and permit; out-of-bounds access to the pointer. To avoid this, the compiler employs; compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as necessary to ensure the; new count value doesn't exceed the actual length of the buffer. Section; `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_ provides more details a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:3689,access,access,3689,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Precautions should be taken to avoid disclosing particularly sensitive data included in the report (e.g. username and password pairs). Changes to the Policy; =====================. The LLVM Security Policy may be changed by majority vote of the LLVM Security Group. Such changes also need to be approved by the LLVM Board. What is considered a security issue?; ====================================. The LLVM Project has a significant amount of code, and not all of it is; considered security-sensitive. This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC. In some cases, parts of the codebase could be handled; as security-sensitive but need significant work to get to the stage where that's; manageable. The LLVM community will need to decide whether it wants to invest in; making these parts of the code securable, and maintain these security; properties over time. In all cases the LLVM Security Group should be consulted,; since they'll be responding to security issues filed against these parts of the; codebase. If you're not sure whether an issue is in-scope for this security process or; not, err towards assuming that it is. The Security Group might agree or disagree; and will explain its rationale in the report, as well as update this document; through the above process. The security-sensitive parts of the LLVM Project currently are the following.; Note that this list can c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst:14486,secur,security,14486,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,3,['secur'],"['security', 'security-sensitive']"

Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.; * Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although that's not strict).; * Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format. Fuzzer Usage; ------------. Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary. In order to build your fuzzer binary, use the `-fsanitize=fuzzer` flag during the; compilation and linking. In most cases you may want to combine libFuzzer with; AddressSanitizer_ (ASAN), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer_ (UBSAN), or both. You can; also build with MemorySanitizer_ (MSAN), but support is experimental::. clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target w/o sanitizers; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with ASAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,signed-integer-overflow mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with a part of UBSAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,memory mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with MSAN. This will perform the necessary instrumentation, as well as linking with the libFuzzer library.; Note that ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` links in the libFuzzer's ``main()`` symbol. If modifying ``CFLAGS`` of a large project, which also compiles executables; requiring their own ``main`` symbol, it may be desirable to request just the; instrumentation without linking::. clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c. Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in; ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` during the linking stage. .. _libfuzzer-corpus:. Corpus; ------.

To do this, implement JIT code; generation by performing the following steps:. * Write an ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` file that contains a machine function pass; that transforms target-machine instructions into relocatable machine; code. * Write an ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` file that implements the JIT interfaces for; target-specific code-generation activities, such as emitting machine code and; stubs. * Modify ``XXXTargetMachine`` so that it provides a ``TargetJITInfo`` object; through its ``getJITInfo`` method. There are several different approaches to writing the JIT support code. For; instance, TableGen and target descriptor files may be used for creating a JIT; code generator, but are not mandatory. For the Alpha and PowerPC target; machines, TableGen is used to generate ``XXXGenCodeEmitter.inc``, which; contains the binary coding of machine instructions and the; ``getBinaryCodeForInstr`` method to access those codes. Other JIT; implementations do not. Both ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` and ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` must include the; ``llvm/CodeGen/MachineCodeEmitter.h`` header file that defines the; ``MachineCodeEmitter`` class containing code for several callback functions; that write data (in bytes, words, strings, etc.) to the output stream. Machine Code Emitter; --------------------. In ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp``, a target-specific of the ``Emitter`` class is; implemented as a function pass (subclass of ``MachineFunctionPass``). The; target-specific implementation of ``runOnMachineFunction`` (invoked by; ``runOnFunction`` in ``MachineFunctionPass``) iterates through the; ``MachineBasicBlock`` calls ``emitInstruction`` to process each instruction and; emit binary code. ``emitInstruction`` is largely implemented with case; statements on the instruction types defined in ``XXXInstrInfo.h``.

Furthermore, debugger information entry; attributes such as ``DW_AT_data_member_location``, ``DW_AT_use_location``, and; ``DW_AT_vtable_elem_location`` are defined as pushing a location description on; the expression stack before evaluating the expression. DWARF Version 5 only allows the stack to contain values and so only a single; memory address can be on the stack. This makes these operations and attributes; incapable of handling location descriptions with multiple places, or places; other than memory. Since; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-allow-location-description-on-the-dwarf-evaluation-stack`; allows the stack to contain location descriptions, the operations are; generalized to support location descriptions that can have multiple places. This; is backwards compatible with DWARF Version 5 and allows objects with multiple; places to be supported. For example, the expression that describes how to access; the field of an object can be evaluated with a location description that has; multiple places and will result in a location description with multiple places. With this change, the separate DWARF Version 5 sections that described DWARF; expressions and location lists are unified into a single section that describes; DWARF expressions in general.

LLVM automatically computes a stack map. One of the most important features; of a ``GCStrategy`` is to compile this information into the executable in; the binary representation expected by the runtime library. The stack map consists of the location and identity of each GC root in the; each function in the module. For each root:. * ``RootNum``: The index of the root. * ``StackOffset``: The offset of the object relative to the frame pointer. * ``RootMetadata``: The value passed as the ``%metadata`` parameter to the; ``@llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic. Also, for the function as a whole:. * ``getFrameSize()``: The overall size of the function's initial stack frame,; not accounting for any dynamic allocation. * ``roots_size()``: The count of roots in the function. To access the stack map, use ``GCFunctionMetadata::roots_begin()`` and; -``end()`` from the :ref:`GCMetadataPrinter <assembly>`:. .. code-block:: c++. for (iterator I = begin(), E = end(); I != E; ++I) {; GCFunctionInfo *FI = *I;; unsigned FrameSize = FI->getFrameSize();; size_t RootCount = FI->roots_size();. for (GCFunctionInfo::roots_iterator RI = FI->roots_begin(),; RE = FI->roots_end();; RI != RE; ++RI) {; int RootNum = RI->Num;; int RootStackOffset = RI->StackOffset;; Constant *RootMetadata = RI->Metadata;; }; }. If the ``llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic is eliminated before code generation by a; custom lowering pass, LLVM will compute an empty stack map. This may be useful; for collector plugins which implement reference counting or a shadow stack. .. _init-roots:. Initializing roots to null; ---------------------------.

Security,"ut to an output which has a register constraint, not a; memory constraint. Only a single input may be tied to an output. There is also an ""interesting"" feature which deserves a bit of explanation: if a; register class constraint allocates a register which is too small for the value; type operand provided as input, the input value will be split into multiple; registers, and all of them passed to the inline asm. However, this feature is often not as useful as you might think. Firstly, the registers are *not* guaranteed to be consecutive. So, on those; architectures that have instructions which operate on multiple consecutive; instructions, this is not an appropriate way to support them. (e.g. the 32-bit; SparcV8 has a 64-bit load, which instruction takes a single 32-bit register. The; hardware then loads into both the named register, and the next register. This; feature of inline asm would not be useful to support that.). A few of the targets provide a template string modifier allowing explicit access; to the second register of a two-register operand (e.g. MIPS ``L``, ``M``, and; ``D``). On such an architecture, you can actually access the second allocated; register (yet, still, not any subsequent ones). But, in that case, you're still; probably better off simply splitting the value into two separate operands, for; clarity. (e.g. see the description of the ``A`` constraint on X86, which,; despite existing only for use with this feature, is not really a good idea to; use). Indirect inputs and outputs; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Indirect output or input constraints can be specified by the ""``*``"" modifier; (which goes after the ""``=``"" in case of an output). This indicates that the asm; will write to or read from the contents of an *address* provided as an input; argument.

Given that definition, R\ :sub:`byte` is defined as follows:. - If R is volatile, the result is target-dependent. (Volatile is; supposed to give guarantees which can support ``sig_atomic_t`` in; C/C++, and may be used for accesses to addresses that do not behave; like normal memory. It does not generally provide cross-thread; synchronization.); - Otherwise, if there is no write to the same byte that happens before; R\ :sub:`byte`, R\ :sub:`byte` returns ``undef`` for that byte.; - Otherwise, if R\ :sub:`byte` may see exactly one write,; R\ :sub:`byte` returns the value written by that write.; - Otherwise, if R is atomic, and all the writes R\ :sub:`byte` may; see are atomic, it chooses one of the values written. See the :ref:`Atomic; Memory Ordering Constraints <ordering>` section for additional; constraints on how the choice is made.; - Otherwise R\ :sub:`byte` returns ``undef``. R returns the value composed of the series of bytes it read. This; implies that some bytes within the value may be ``undef`` **without**; the entire value being ``undef``.

The store to ``%a`` is clearly not a clobber for the store to ``%b``. It would; be the walker's goal to figure this out, and return ``liveOnEntry`` when queried; for the clobber of ``MemoryAccess`` ``2``. By default, ``MemorySSA`` provides a walker that can optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s; and ``MemoryUse``\ s by consulting whatever alias analysis stack you happen to; be using. Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize.

On Linux installations, this is typically located at:. .. code-block:: bash. /usr/lib/<llvm-version>/lib/clang/<clang-version>/lib/linux/libclang_rt.fuzzer_no_main-<architecture>.a. If building libFuzzer from source, this is located at the following path; in the build output directory:. .. code-block:: bash. lib/linux/libclang_rt.fuzzer_no_main-<architecture>.a. From here, the code can do whatever setup it requires, and when it's ready; to start fuzzing, it can call `LLVMFuzzerRunDriver`, passing in the program; arguments and a callba",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:24383,access,access,24383,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,1,['access'],['access']

The SLP-vectorizer processes the code bottom-up, across basic blocks, in search of scalars to combine. Usage; ------.

By default, the http server is open for anonymous access. One could restrict the access to the server for authenticated users only. First of all, one should create a password file, using the **htdigest** utility. ```bash; [shell] htdigest -c .htdigest domain_name user_name; ```. It is recommended not to use special symbols in domain or user names. Several users can be add to the "".htdigest"" file. When starting the server, the following arguments should be specified:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name"");; ```. After that, the web browser will automatically request to input a name/password for the domain ""domain_name"".

To allow such action, one could either grant generic access for all or one could allow to execute only special method:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow=all"");; serv->Restrict(""/Folder/histo1"", ""allow_method=GetTitle"");; ```.

Security,"which is being miscompiled. The miscompilation debugger assumes that; the selected code generator is working properly. Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead. If you would like to stick to; particular crash, you should write check scripts to validate the error; message, see ``-compile-command`` in :doc:`CommandGuide/bugpoint`. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, debugging will go faster; if you manually modify the program or its inputs to reduce the runtime, but; still exhibit the problem. * ``bugpoint`` is extremely useful when working on a new optimization: it helps; track down regressions quickly. To avoid having to relink ``bugpoint`` every; time you change your optimization however, have ``bugpoint`` dynamically load; your optimization with the ``-load`` option. * ``bugpoint`` can generate a lot of output and run for a long period of time.; It is often useful to capture the output of the program to file. For example,; in the C shell, you can run:. .. code-block:: console. $ bugpoint ... |& tee bugpoint.log. to get a copy of ``bugpoint``'s output in the file ``bugpoint.log``, as well; as on your terminal. * ``bugpoint`` cannot debug problems with the LLVM linker.

Pointer parameter without corresponding ``Param`` is considered unsafe and we; assume that access with any offset is possible. Example:. If we have the following function:. .. code-block:: text. define i64 @foo(ptr %0, ptr %1, ptr %2, i8 %3) {; store ptr %1, ptr @x; %5 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i64 5; %6 = load i8, ptr %5; %7 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %2, i8 %3; tail call void @bar(i8 %3, ptr %7); %8 = load i64, ptr %0; ret i64 %8; }.

The function may access just 8 bytes of the parameter %0 . ``calls`` is empty,; so the parameter is either not used for function calls or ``offset`` already; covers all accesses from nested function calls.; Parameter %1 escapes, so access is unknown.; The function itself can access just a single byte of the parameter %2.

Simple alias analysis implemented in terms of ``ScalarEvolution`` queries. This differs from traditional loop dependence analysis in that it tests for; dependencies within a single iteration of a loop, rather than dependencies; between different iterations. ``ScalarEvolution`` has a more complete understanding of pointer arithmetic; than ``BasicAliasAnalysis``' collection of ad-hoc analyses. ``stack-safety``: Stack Safety Analysis; ---------------------------------------.

The template function is analogous; to *std::async* but without the possibility of specifying the execution policy and without creating a thread but; directly submitting the work to the runtime in order to use the same pool as any other item of work spawned by ROOT.; - The TFuture template has been added to the ROOT::Experimental namespace. It represents a future and is compatible; with the ROOT::Experimental::Async function. It has the same properties of an STL future and can be initialised by; one of these classes. For example, *TFuture<int> = std::async(myfunc,a,b,c);*; - Reintroduced greedy reduction in TProcessExecutor.; - Fix empty chunks in the result vector of TThreadExecutor::Map. If the integer partition of the data in nChunks causes the existence of empty chunks (e.g the—rounded up—division of 12 elements in 5 chunks), the number of chunks is decreased to avoid empty chunks and, as a consequence, accesses to uninitialized memory in the reduction step. ## Language Bindings; - PyROOT now supports list initialisation with tuples. For example, suppose to have a function `void f(const TH1F& h)`. In C++, this can be invoked with this syntax: `f({""name"", ""title"", 64, -4, 4})`.

Doing so will save (at least) one heap allocation and free per iteration of the; loop. .. _dss_deque:. <deque>; ^^^^^^^. ``std::deque`` is, in some senses, a generalized version of ``std::vector``.; Like ``std::vector``, it provides constant time random access and other similar; properties, but it also provides efficient access to the front of the list.

It; performs a heap allocation for every element inserted into it, thus having an; extremely high constant factor, particularly for small data types.; ``std::list`` also only supports bidirectional iteration, not random access; iteration. In exchange for this high cost, std::list supports efficient access to both ends; of the list (like ``std::deque``, but unlike ``std::vector`` or; ``SmallVector``). In addition, the iterator invalidation characteristics of; std::list are stronger than that of a vector class: inserting or removing an; element into the list does not invalidate iterator or pointers to other elements; in the list. .. _dss_ilist:. llvm/ADT/ilist.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``ilist<T>`` implements an 'intrusive' doubly-linked list.

The Darwin and Linux implementation; relies on padding and the ability to map a file over the existing memory; mapping which is generally only available on POSIX systems and isn't suitable; for other platforms. On Fuchsia, we rely on the ability to relocate counters at runtime using a; level of indirection. On every counter access, we add a bias to the counter; address. This bias is stored in ``__llvm_profile_counter_bias`` symbol that's; provided by the profile runtime and is initially set to zero, meaning no; relocation. The runtime can map the profile into memory at arbitrary locations,; and set bias to the offset between the original and the new counter location,; at which point every subsequent counter access will be to the new location,; which allows updating profile directly akin to the continuous mode. The advantage of this approach is that doesn't require any special OS support.; The disadvantage is the extra overhead due to additional instructions required; for each counter access (overhead both in terms of binary size and performance); plus duplication of counters (i.e. one copy in the binary itself and another; copy that's mapped into memory). This implementation can be also enabled for; other platforms by passing the ``-runtime-counter-relocation`` option to the; backend during compilation.

The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG.

E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool. AddressSanitizer may help with this validation. We can instrument all variables; as usual but additionally store stack-safe information in the; ``ASanStackVariableDescription``. Then if AddressSanitizer detects a bug on; a 'safe' variable we can produce an additional report to let the user know that; probably Stack Safety Analysis failed and we should check for a bug in the; compiler.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst:1831,sanitiz,sanitizers,1831,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,3,"['sanitiz', 'validat']","['sanitizers', 'validation']"

Security,"yclass.cxx:98: warning:; converting from ""void (Myclass::*)(void *)""to ""void *"" ); ```. Strictly speaking, `Thread0` must be a static member function to be; called from a thread. Some compilers, for example `gcc` version 2.95.2,; may not allow the `(void(*) (void*))s` cast and just stop if `Thread0`; is not static. On the other hand, if `Thread0` is static, no compiler; warnings are generated at all. Because the `'this'` pointer is passed in; `'arg'` in the call to `Thread0(void *arg),` you have access to the; instance of the class even if `Thread0` is static. Using the `'this'`; pointer, non static members can still be read and written from; `Thread0`, as long as you have provided Getter and Setter methods for; these members. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t state = arg->GetRunStatus();; arg->SetRunStatus(state);; ```. Second, the pointer to the current instance of `Myclass`, i.e. (void\*); this, has to be passed as first argument of the threaded function; Thread0 (C++ member functions internally expect this pointer as first; argument to have access to class members of the same instance).; `pthreads` are made for simple C functions and do not know about Thread0; being a member function of a class. Thus, you have to pass this; information by hand, if you want to access all members of the `Myclass`; instance from the Thread0 function. Note: Method Thread0 cannot be a virtual member function, since the cast; of `Thread0` to `void(*)` in the **`TThread`** constructor may raise; problems with C++ virtual function table. However, Thread0 may call; another virtual member function virtual void `Myclass::Func0()` which; then can be overridden in a derived class of `Myclass`. (See example; `TMhs3`). Class `Myclass` may also provide a method to stop the running thread:. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t Myclass::Threadstop() {; if (mTh) {; TThread::Delete(mTh);; delete mTh;; mTh=0;; return 0;; }; return 1;; }; ```.

Security,"ymbolic; offsets start from the base region!. Region Invalidation; -------------------. Unlike binding invalidation, region invalidation occurs when the entire; contents of a region may have changed---say, because it has been passed to a; function the analyzer can model, like memcpy, or because its address has; escaped, usually as an argument to an opaque function call. In these cases we; need to throw away not just all bindings within the region itself, but within; its entire cluster, since neighboring regions may be accessed via pointer; arithmetic. Region invalidation typically does even more than this, however. Because it; usually represents the complete escape of a region from the analyzer's model,; its *contents* must also be transitively invalidated. (For example, if a region; ``p`` of type ``int **`` is invalidated, the contents of ``*p`` and ``**p`` may; have changed as well.) The algorithm that traverses this transitive closure of; accessible regions is known as ClusterAnalysis, and is also used for finding; all live bindings in the store (in order to throw away the dead ones). The name; ""ClusterAnalysis"" predates the cluster-based organization of bindings, but; refers to the same concept: during invalidation and liveness analysis, all; bindings within a cluster must be treated in the same way for a conservative; model of program behavior. Default Bindings; ----------------. Most bindings in RegionStore are simple scalar values -- integers and pointers.; These are known as ""Direct"" bindings. However, RegionStore supports a second; type of binding called a ""Default"" binding. These are used to provide values to; all the elements of an aggregate type (struct or array) without having to; explicitly specify a binding for each individual element. When there is no Direct binding for a particular region, the store manager; looks at each super-region in turn to see if there is a Default binding. If so,; this value is used as the value of the original region.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing.

We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``.

In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible.

You can also use the `Transform()` method or the `operator *=` of the; **`TVector3`** class:. ``` {.cpp}; TVector3 v;; TRotation r;; v.Transform(r);; ```. ## TLorentzVector. **`TLorentzVector`** is a general four-vector class, which can be used; either for the description of position and time (`x`, `y`, `z`, `t`) or; momentum and energy (`px`, `py`, `pz`, `E`). ### Declaration. **`TLorentzVector`** has been implemented as a set a **`TVector3`** and; a `Double_t` variable. By default, all components are initialized by; zero. ``` {.cpp}; TLorentzVector v1; // initialized by (0.,0.,0.,0.); TLorentzVector v2(1.,1.,1.,1.);; TLorentzVector v3(v1);; TLorentzVector v4(TVector3(1.,2.,3.),4.);; ```. For backward compatibility there are two constructors from a `Double_t`; and `Float_t` array. ### Access to Components. There are two sets of access functions to the components of a; **`TLorentzVector`**: `X()`, `Y()`, `Z()`, `T()` and `Px()`, `Py()`,; `Pz()` and `E()`. Both sets return the same values but the first set is; more relevant for use where **`TLorentzVector`** describes a combination; of position and time and the second set is more relevant where; **`TLorentzVector`** describes momentum and energy:. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t xx =v.X();; ...; Double_t tt = v.T();; Double_t px = v.Px();; ...; Double_t ee = v.E();; ```. The components of **`TLorentzVector`** can also accessed by index:. ``` {.cpp}; xx = v(0);orxx = v[0];; yy = v(1);yy = v[1];; zz = v(2);zz = v[2];; tt = v(3);tt = v[3];; ```. You can use the `Vect()` method to get the vector component of; **`TLorentzVector`**:. ``` {.cpp}; TVector3 p = v.Vect();; ```. For setting components there are two methods: `SetX(),.., SetPx(),..:`. ``` {.cpp}; v.SetX(1.); orv.SetPx(1.);; ......; v.SetT(1.);v.SetE(1.);; ```.

Testability," % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On. If you have `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ checked out and built, you; can run the LLVM and Clang tests simultaneously using:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-all. To run the tests with Valgrind (Memcheck by default), use the ``LIT_ARGS`` make; variable to pass the required options to lit. For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled. To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM. For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM. The regression tests will use the Python psutil module only if installed in a; **non-user** location. Under Linux, install with sudo or within a virtual; environment.

This function implements a very simple parser for the kinds of strings we are; interested in. Although it has some holes (it allows ""``123KKK``"" for example),; it is good enough for this example. Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below). Now that we have our parser class, we can; use it like this:. .. code-block:: c++. static cl::opt<unsigned, false, FileSizeParser>; MFS(""max-file-size"", cl::desc(""Maximum file size to accept""),; cl::value_desc(""size""));. Which adds this to the output of our program:. ::. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); ...; -max-file-size=<size> - Maximum file size to accept. And we can test that our parse works correctly now (the test program just prints; out the max-file-size argument value):. ::. $ ./test; MFS: 0; $ ./test -max-file-size=123MB; MFS: 128974848; $ ./test -max-file-size=3G; MFS: 3221225472; $ ./test -max-file-size=dog; -max-file-size option: 'dog' value invalid for file size argument!. It looks like it works. The error message that we get is nice and helpful, and; we seem to accept reasonable file sizes. This wraps up the ""custom parser""; tutorial. Exploiting external storage; ---------------------------. Several of the LLVM libraries define static ``cl::opt`` instances that will; automatically be included in any program that links with that library. This is; a feature. However, sometimes it is necessary to know the value of the command; line option outside of the library. In these cases the library does or should; provide an external storage location that is accessible to users of the; library.

Testability," (e.g.; replacing globals, removing unused instructions, etc), similar to what; already exists, but with more in-depth minimization. Granted, if the community differs on this proposal, the legacy code could still; be present in the tool, but with the caveat of still being documented and; designed towards delta reduction. ### Command-Line Options; We are proposing to reduce the plethora of bugpoint’s options to just two: an; interesting-ness test and the arguments for said test, similar to other delta; reduction tools such as CReduce, Delta, and Lithium; the tool should feel less; cluttered, and there should also be no uncertainty about how to operate it. The interesting-ness test that’s going to be run to reduce the code is given; by name:; `--test=<test_name>`; If a `--test` option is not given, the program exits; this option is similar; to bugpoint’s current `-compile-custom` option, which lets the user run a; custom script. The interesting-ness test would be defined as a script that returns 0 when the; IR achieves a user-defined behaviour (e.g. failure to compile on clang) and a; nonzero value when otherwise. Leaving the user the freedom to determine what is; and isn’t interesting to the tool, and thus, streamlining the process of; reducing a test-case. If the test accepts any arguments (excluding the input ll/bc file), they are; given via the following flag:; `--test_args=<test_arguments>`; If unspecified, the test is run as given. It’s worth noting that the input file; would be passed as a parameter to the test, similar how `-compile-custom`; currently operates. ### Implementation; The tool would behave similar to CReduce’s functionality in that it would have a; list of passes that try to minimize the given test-case. We should be able to; modularize the tool’s behavior, as well as making it easier to maintain and; expand.

The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is; presented in the figure 17-36. It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the; answer.

This is; effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current; volume.; - in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the; method FindInCluster() is invoked. This method checks all different; possibilities within the cluster of overlapping candidates. One of; the candidates is prioritized if one of the following conditions id; fulfilled (in order):; - Is declared as non-overlapping (these are anyway searched first); - Has at least one daughter that contains the current point; - Was already declared as containing the point at a previous step. \image html geometry016.png ""Finding the location of a point in the geom",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md:117790,log,logical,117790,geom/geom/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md,1,['log'],['logical']

Function definitions and calls also work, but something went very wrong on that; last line. The call looks valid, so what happened? As you may have guessed from; the API a Module is a unit of allocation for the JIT, and testfunc was part; of the same module that contained anonymous expression. When we removed that; module from the JIT to free the memory for the anonymous expression, we deleted; the definition of ``testfunc`` along with it. Then, when we tried to call; testfunc a second time, the JIT could no longer find it. The easiest way to fix this is to put the anonymous expression in a separate; module from the rest of the function definitions. The JIT will happily resolve; function calls across module boundaries, as long as each of the functions called; has a prototype, and is added to the JIT before it is called. By putting the; anonymous expression in a different module we can delete it without affecting; the rest of the functions. In fact, we're going to go a step further and put every function in its own; module. Doing so allows us to exploit a useful property of the KaleidoscopeJIT; that will make our environment more REPL-like: Functions can be added to the; JIT more than once (unlike a module where every function must have a unique; definition).

Testability," - ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``: This function allows for initializing and; re-initializing an installed logging implementation. See; ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` for details, part of the XRay compiler-rt; installation. Once a logging implementation has been initialized, it can be ""stopped"" by; finalizing the implementation through the ``__xray_log_finalize()`` function.; The finalization routine is the opposite of the initialization. When finalized,; an implementation's data can be cleared out through the; ``__xray_log_flushLog()`` function. For implementations that support in-memory; processing, these should register an iterator function to provide access to the; data via the ``__xray_log_set_buffer_iterator(...)`` which allows code calling; the ``__xray_log_process_buffers(...)`` function to deal with the data in; memory. All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end. Like all the other modes installed through ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``, the; implementation can be configured through the ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``; function, providing the mode string and the flag options. Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events.

Testability," ----------------------------------------------------. So far we have seen how the CommandLine library handles builtin types like; ``std::string``, ``bool`` and ``int``, but how does it handle things it doesn't; know about, like enums or '``int*``'s?. The answer is that it uses a table-driven generic parser (unless you specify; your own parser, as described in the `Extension Guide`_). This parser maps; literal strings to whatever type is required, and requires you to tell it what; this mapping should be. Let's say that we would like to add four optimization levels to our optimizer,; using the standard flags ""``-g``"", ""``-O0``"", ""``-O1``"", and ""``-O2``"". We; could easily implement this with boolean options like above, but there are; several problems with this strategy:. #. A user could specify more than one of the options at a time, for example,; ""``compiler -O3 -O2``"". The CommandLine library would not be able to catch; this erroneous input for us. #. We would have to test 4 different variables to see which ones are set. #. This doesn't map to the numeric levels that we want... so we cannot easily; see if some level >= ""``-O1``"" is enabled. To cope with these problems, we can use an enum value, and have the CommandLine; library fill it in with the appropriate level directly, which is used like this:. .. code-block:: c++. enum OptLevel {; g, O1, O2, O3; };. cl::opt<OptLevel> OptimizationLevel(cl::desc(""Choose optimization level:""),; cl::values(; clEnumVal(g , ""No optimizations, enable debugging""),; clEnumVal(O1, ""Enable trivial optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O2, ""Enable default optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O3, ""Enable expensive optimizations"")));. ...; if (OptimizationLevel >= O2) doPartialRedundancyElimination(...);; ...

Testability," . TMVA. TMVA version 4.1.0 is included in this root release. The most; important new feature is the support for simulataneous classification ; of multiple output classes for several multi-variate methods. ; A lot of effort went into consolidation of the software,; i.e. method performance and robustness, and framework; stability. The changes with respect to ROOT 5.27 / TMVA 4.0.7 are; in detail:. Framework. Multi-class support. The support of multiple; output classes (i.e., more than a single background and signal; class) has been enabled for these methods: MLP (NN), BDTG,; FDA.; The multiclass; functionality can be enabled with the Factory option; ""AnalysisType=multiclass"". Training data is; specified with an additional classname, e.g. via; factory->AddTree(tree,""classname"");. After the; training a genetic algorithm is invoked to determine the best; cuts for selecting a specific class, based on the figure of; merit: purity*efficiency. TMVA comes with two examples in; $ROOTSYS/tmva/test: TMVAMulticlass.C; and TMVAMulticlassApplication.C. New TMVA event vector building. The code; for splitting the input data into training and test samples for; all classes and the mixing of those samples to one training and; one test sample has been rewritten completely. The new code is; more performant and has a clearer structure. This fixes several; bugs which have been reported by some users of TMVA.; Code and performance test framework: A unit; test framework for daily software and method performance; validation has been implemented.; . Methods. BDT Automatic parameter optimisation for building the; tree architecture: The optimisation procedure uses the; performance of the trained classifier on the ""test sample"" for; finding the set of optimal parameters. Two different methods to; traverse the parameter space are available (scanning, genetic; algorithm). Currently parameter optimization is implemented only; for these three parameters that influence the tree architectur:; the maximu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tmva/doc/v528/index.html:997,test,test,997,tmva/doc/v528/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tmva/doc/v528/index.html,2,['test'],['test']

If the definition your test is looking for doesn't match (because; of a bug in the compiler), it may match further away from the use, and mask; real bugs away. In those cases, to enforce the order, use a non-DAG directive between DAG-blocks. A ``CHECK-DAG:`` directive skips matches that overlap the matches of any; preceding ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block. Not only; is this non-overlapping behavior consistent with other directives, but it's; also necessary to handle sets of non-unique strings or patterns.

Testability," A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important. However, if community input is not reached before the; release is out, all bugs reported will have to go on the next stable release. The official release managers are:. * Even releases: Tom Stellard (tstellar@redhat.com); * Odd releases: Tobias Hieta (tobias@hieta.se). The official release testers are volunteered from the community and have; consistently validated and released binaries for their targets/OSs. To contact; them, you should post on the `Discourse forums (Project; Infrastructure - Release Testers). <https://discourse.llvm.org/c/infrastructure/release-testers/66>`_. The official testers list is in the file ``RELEASE_TESTERS.TXT``, in the ``LLVM``; repository. Community Testing; -----------------. Once all testing has been completed and appropriate bugs filed, the release; candidate tarballs are put on the website and the LLVM community is notified.

Testability," A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C. For more information about some of the advanced build configurations supported; via Cache files see :doc:`AdvancedBuilds`. Executing the Tests; ===================. Testing is performed when the *check-all* target is built. For instance, if you are; using Makefiles, execute this command in the root of your build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. On Visual Studio, you may run tests by building the project ""check-all"".; For more information about testing, see the :doc:`TestingGuide`. Cross compiling; ===============. See `this wiki page <https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cmake/CrossCompiling>`_ for; generic instructions on how to cross-compile with CMake. It goes into detailed; explanations and may seem daunting, but it is not. On the wiki page there are; several examples including toolchain files.

Also see the `LLVM-related variables`_ section for variables used when; cross-compiling. Embedding LLVM in your project; ==============================.

Testability," ABI is a work in progress. If you don't require MSVC ABI compatibility or don't; want to use Microsoft's C and C++ runtimes, the mingw32 toolchain might be a; better fit for your project. Second, Clang implements many MSVC language extensions, such as; ``__declspec(dllexport)`` and a handful of pragmas. These are typically; controlled by ``-fms-extensions``. Third, MSVC accepts some C++ code that Clang will typically diagnose as; invalid. When these constructs are present in widely included system headers,; Clang attempts to recover and continue compiling the user's program. Most; parsing and semantic compatibility tweaks are controlled by; ``-fms-compatibility`` and ``-fdelayed-template-parsing``, and they are a work; in progress. Finally, there is :ref:`clang-cl`, a driver program for clang that attempts to; be compatible with MSVC's cl.exe. ABI features; ============. The status of major ABI-impacting C++ features:. * Record layout: :good:`Complete`. We've tested this with a fuzzer and have; fixed all known bugs. * Class inheritance: :good:`Mostly complete`. This covers all of the standard; OO features you would expect: virtual method inheritance, multiple; inheritance, and virtual inheritance. Every so often we uncover a bug where; our tables are incompatible, but this is pretty well in hand. This feature; has also been fuzz tested. * Name mangling: :good:`Ongoing`. Every new C++ feature generally needs its own; mangling. For example, member pointer template arguments have an interesting; and distinct mangling. Fortunately, incorrect manglings usually do not result; in runtime errors. Non-inline functions with incorrect manglings usually; result in link errors, which are relatively easy to diagnose. Incorrect; manglings for inline functions and templates result in multiple copies in the; final image. The C++ standard requires that those addresses be equal, but few; programs rely on this. * Member pointers: :good:`Mostly complete`.

Note that this fuzz target does not depend on libFuzzer in any way; and so it is possible and even desirable to use it with other fuzzing engines; e.g. AFL_ and/or Radamsa_. Some important things to remember about fuzz targets:. * The fuzzing engine will execute the fuzz target many times with different inputs in the same process.; * It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).; * It must not `exit()` on any input.; * It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.; * It must be as deterministic as possible. Non-determinism (e.g. random decisions not based on the input bytes) will make fuzzing inefficient.; * It must be fast. Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.; * Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although that's not strict).; * Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format. Fuzzer Usage; ------------. Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary. In order to build your fuzzer binary, use the `-fsanitize=fuzzer` flag during the; compilation and linking. In most cases you may want to combine libFuzzer with; AddressSanitizer_ (ASAN), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer_ (UBSAN), or both. You can; also build with MemorySanitizer_ (MSAN), but support is experimental::. clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target w/o sanitizers; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with ASAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,signed-integer-overflow mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with a part of UBSAN; c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:2414,log,logging,2414,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,1,['log'],['logging']

During the first round of testing, all regressions must be fixed before the; second release candidate is tagged. In the subsequent stages, the testing is only to ensure that bug; fixes previously merged in have not created new major problems. *This is not; the time to solve additional and unrelated bugs!* If no patches are merged in,; the release is determined to be ready and the release manager may move onto the; next stage. Reporting Regressions; ---------------------. Every regression that is found during the tests (as per the criteria above),; should be filled in a bug in GitHub and added to the release milestone. If a bug can't be reproduced, or stops being a blocker, it should be removed; from the Milestone. Debugging can continue, but on trunk. Backport Requests; -----------------. Instructions for requesting a backport to a stable branch can be found :doc:`here <GitHub>`. Triaging Bug Reports for Releases; ---------------------------------.

Testability," Controlling implementation limits; ---------------------------------. .. option:: -fopenmp-use-tls. Controls code generation for OpenMP threadprivate variables. In presence of; this option all threadprivate variables are generated the same way as thread; local variables, using TLS support. If `-fno-openmp-use-tls`; is provided or target does not support TLS, code generation for threadprivate; variables relies on OpenMP runtime library. .. _opencl:. OpenCL Features; ===============. Clang can be used to compile OpenCL kernels for execution on a device; (e.g. GPU). It is possible to compile the kernel into a binary (e.g. for AMDGPU); that can be uploaded to run directly on a device (e.g. using; `clCreateProgramWithBinary; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf#111>`_) or; into generic bitcode files loadable into other toolchains. Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl. Compiling to bitcode can be done as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -c -emit-llvm test.cl. This will produce a file `test.bc` that can be used in vendor toolchains; to perform machine code generation. Note that if compiled to bitcode for generic targets such as SPIR/SPIR-V,; portable IR is produced that can be used with various vendor; tools as well as open source tools such as `SPIRV-LLVM Translator; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_; to produce SPIR-V binary.

The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:3603,test,testing,3603,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Run :program:`lit` in debug mode, for debugging configuration issues and; :program:`lit` itself. .. option:: --show-suites. List the discovered test suites and exit. .. option:: --show-tests. List all of the discovered tests and exit. EXIT STATUS; -----------. :program:`lit` will exit with an exit code of 1 if there are any FAIL or XPASS; results. Otherwise, it will exit with the status 0. Other exit codes are used; for non-test related failures (for example a user error or an internal program; error). .. _test-discovery:. TEST DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directori",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:10859,test,test,10859,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file. Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow. In that case, you might wish to use git to list changed files.; For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ darker -r HEAD^ $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD^).

Testability," For simple caching, the caching logic can be separated from the; mathematical code that is being moved to `MathFuncs.h`, so that it can; retained in the original file. For more complicated scenarios, the `code` variable can be used to identify; use cases (parts of the mathematical code in `evaluate()`) that should be; supported, while other parts that are explicitly not be supported (e.g., using; `if code==1 {...} else if code==2 {...}`). ### Can classes using Numerical Integration support AD?. So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad. To handle this, either define a custom derivative for that external function,; or find a way to expose it to Clad. An example of this can be seen with `gamma_cdf()` in MathFuncs.h`,; for which the custom derivative is not supported, but in this specific; instance, it falls back to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:27802,test,tested,27802,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['test'],['tested']

Straw Man Migration Plan; ========================. Step #1 : Before The Move; -------------------------. 1. Update docs to mention the move, so people are aware of what is going on.; 2. Set up a read-only version of the GitHub project, mirroring our current SVN; repository.; 3. Add the required bots to implement the commit emails, as well as the; umbrella repository update (if the multirepo is selected) or the read-only; Git views for the sub-projects (if the monorepo is selected). Step #2 : Git Move; ------------------. 4. Update the buildbots to pick up updates and commits from the GitHub; repository. Not all bots have to migrate at this point, but it'll help; provide infrastructure testing.; 5. Update Phabricator to pick up commits from the GitHub repository.; 6.

Instruct downstream integrators to pick up commits from the GitHub; repository.; 8. Review and prepare an update for the LLVM documentation. Until this point nothing has changed for developers, it will just; boil down to a lot of work for buildbot and other infrastructure; owners. The migration will pause here until all dependencies have cleared, and all; problems have been solved. Step #3: Write Access Move; --------------------------. 9.

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false.

In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler.

Testability," Manual; ================. This section acts as internal documentation for OpenCL features design; as well as some important implementation aspects. It is primarily targeted; at the advanced users and the toolchain developers integrating frontend; functionality as a component. OpenCL Metadata; ---------------. Clang uses metadata to provide additional OpenCL semantics in IR needed for; backends and OpenCL runtime. Each kernel will have function metadata attached to it, specifying the arguments.; Kernel argument metadata is used to provide source level information for querying; at runtime, for example using the `clGetKernelArgInfo; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.2.pdf#167>`_; call. Note that ``-cl-kernel-arg-info`` enables more information about the original; kernel code to be added e.g. kernel parameter names will appear in the OpenCL; metadata along with other information. The IDs used to encode the OpenCL's logical address spaces in the argument info; metadata follows the SPIR address space mapping as defined in the SPIR; specification `section 2.2; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir/specs/spir_spec-2.0.pdf#18>`_. OpenCL Specific Options; -----------------------. In addition to the options described in :doc:`UsersManual` there are the; following options specific to the OpenCL frontend. All the options in this section are frontend-only and therefore if used; with regular clang driver they require frontend forwarding, e.g. ``-cc1``; or ``-Xclang``. .. _opencl_finclude_default_header:. .. option:: -finclude-default-header. Adds most of builtin types and function declarations during compilations. By; default the OpenCL headers are not loaded by the frontend and therefore certain; builtin types and most of builtin functions are not declared. To load them; automatically this flag can be passed to the frontend (see also :ref:`the; section on the OpenCL Header <opencl_header>`):. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -Xclang -finclude-default-header",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst:2166,log,logical,2166,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

Step 3.5: More Complicated Matchers; ===================================. Our simple matcher is capable of discovering for loops, but we would; still need to filter out many more ourselves. We can do a good portion; of the remaining work with some cleverly chosen matchers, but first we; need to decide exactly which properties we want to allow. How can we characterize for loops over arrays which would be eligible; for translation to range-based syntax? Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable. The matcher for (2) is straightforward:; require a pre- or post-increment of the same vari",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst:10414,test,test-files,10414,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,1,['test'],['test-files']

The analyzer extends this checking by using its deeper; symbolic analysis to track what pointer values are potentially null and then; flag warnings when they are passed in a function call via a 'nonnull'; parameter.; Example. $ cat test.m; int bar(int*p, int q, int *r) __attribute__((nonnull(1,3)));. int foo(int *p, int *q) {; return !p ? bar(q, 2, p); : bar(p, 2, q);; }.

Testability," MyJIT J = ...;. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. JITStdLibJD.define(absoluteSymbols(SymbolMap({; { Mangle(""__MyJITInstance""),; { ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(&J), JITSymbolFlags() } }; });. Aliases and Reexports; ---------------------. Aliases and reexports allow you to define new symbols that map to existing; symbols. This can be useful for changing linkage relationships between symbols; across sessions without having to recompile code. For example, imagine that; JIT'd code has access to a log function, ``void log(const char*)`` for which; there are two implementations in the JIT standard library: ``log_fast`` and; ``log_detailed``. Your JIT can choose which one of these definitions will be; used when the ``log`` symbol is referenced by setting up an alias at JIT startup; time:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. auto LogImplementationSymbol =; Verbose ? Mangle(""log_detailed"") : Mangle(""log_fast"");. JITStdLibJD.define(; symbolAliases(SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""log""),; { LogImplementationSymbol; JITSymbolFlags::Exported | JITSymbolFlags::Callable } }; });. The ``symbolAliases`` function allows you to define aliases within a single; JITDylib. The ``reexports`` function provides the same functionality, but; operates across JITDylib boundaries. E.g. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD1 = ... ;; auto &JD2 = ... ;. // Make 'bar' in JD2 an alias for 'foo' from JD1.; JD2.define(; reexports(JD1, SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""bar""), { Mangle(""foo""), JITSymbolFlags::Exported } }; });. The reexports utility can be handy for composing a single JITDylib interface by; re-exporting symbols from several other JITDylibs. .. _Laziness:. Laziness; ========.

RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext. > [roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/CodeSquashContext.h](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/CodeSquashContext.h). It handles how to create a C++ function out of the compute graph (which is; created with different RooFit classes). This C++ function will be independent; of these RooFit classes. RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext helps traverse the compute graph received from RooFit and; then it translates that into a single piece of code (a C++ function), that can; then be differentiated using Clad. It also helps evaluate the model. In RooFit, evaluation is done using the 'evaluate()' function. It also; performs a lot of book-keeping, caching, etc. that is required for RooFit (but; not necessarily for AD). A new `translate()` function is added to RooFit classes that includes a call; to this `evaluate()` function. `translate()` helps implement the Code; Squashing logic. All RooFit classes that should support AD need to use this; function. It creates a string of code, which is then just-in-time compiled; using Cling (C++ interpreter for ROOT). For each of the `translate()`; functions, it is important to call `addResult()` since this is what enables; the squashing to happen. #### Helper Functions. - **RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext**: this class maintains the context for squashing of; RooFit models into code. It keeps track of the results of various; expressions to avoid redundant calculations. - **Loop Scopes()**: `beginloop()` and `endloop()` are used to create a scope; for iterating over vector observables (collections of data). This is; especially useful when dealing with data that comes in sets or arrays. - **addToGlobalScope()**: helps add code statements to the global scope; (e.g., to declare variables). - **addToCodeBody()**: adds the input string to the squashed code body.

Prior to the generation of SPIR-V binary with Clang, ``llvm-spirv``; should be built or installed. Please refer to `the following instructions; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#build-instructions>`_; for more details. Clang will expect the ``llvm-spirv`` executable to; be present in the ``PATH`` environment variable. Clang uses ``llvm-spirv``; with `the widely adopted assembly syntax package; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/#build-with-spirv-tools>`_. `The versioning; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/releases>`_ of; ``llvm-spirv`` is aligned with Clang major releases. The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases. Clang also supports integrated generation of SPIR-V without use of ``llvm-spirv``; tool as an experimental feature when ``-fintegrated-objemitter`` flag is passed in; the command line. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -fintegrated-objemitter -c test.cl.

Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt.

Testability," The user code does not need to check if the API names are defined, because; these names are automatically replaced by ``(0)`` or the equivalence of noop; if the ``clang`` is not compiling for profile generation. Such replacement can happen because ``clang`` adds one of two macros depending; on the ``-fprofile-generate`` and the ``-fprofile-use`` flags. * ``__LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_GENERATE``: defined when one of; ``-fprofile[-instr]-generate``/``-fcs-profile-generate`` is in effect.; * ``__LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_USE``: defined when one of; ``-fprofile-use``/``-fprofile-instr-use`` is in effect. The two macros can be used to provide more flexibiilty so a user program; can execute code specifically intended for profile generate or profile use.; For example, a user program can have special logging during profile generate:. .. code-block:: c. #if __LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_GENERATE; expensive_logging_of_full_program_state();; #endif. The logging is automatically excluded during a normal build of the program,; hence it does not impact performance during a normal execution. It is advised to use such fine tuning only in a program's cold regions. The weak; symbols can introduce extra control flow (the ``if`` checks), while the macros; (hence declarations they guard in ``profile/instr_prof_interface.h``); can change the control flow of the functions that use them between profile; generation and profile use (which can lead to discarded counters in such; functions). Using these APIs in the program's cold regions introduces less; overhead and leads to more optimized code. Disabling Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In certain situations, it may be useful to disable profile generation or use; for specific files in a build, without affecting the main compilation flags; used for the other files in the project.

Testability," This is new method particularly useful for producing the expected limit bands where one needs to generate background-only pseudo-experiments in the same way that was used for the primary limit calculation. HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic). Both CLs+b and CLb are equivalent to these p-values, and the HypoTestResult has a simple switch SetBackgroundIsAlt() to specify the pairing between (null p-value, alternate p-value) and (CLb, CLs+b).

Testability," Tool developers, not on; end users of these tools. Clang Tools Organization; ========================. Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly; used by C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by; Clang developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers; who happen to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their; functionality. They are developed in three components: the underlying; infrastructure for building a standalone tool based on Clang, core; shared logic used by many different tools in the form of refactoring and; rewriting libraries, and the tools themselves. The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the; :doc:`LibTooling <LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much; more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The; common refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of; LibTooling organizationally. A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as; examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of; the tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation; from the core libraries. We intentionally do not support public; libraries in the side repository, as we want to carefully review and; find good APIs for libraries as they are lifted out of a few tools and; into the core Clang library set. Regardless of which repository Clang Tools' code resides in, the; development process and practices for all Clang Tools are exactly those; of Clang itself. They are entirely within the Clang *project*,; regardless of the version control scheme. Core Clang Tools; ================.

Testability," Treating the annotations as type; sugars means two types with incompatible external bounds annotations may be; considered canonically the same types. This is sometimes necessary, for example,; to make the ``__counted_by`` and friends not participate in function; overloading. However, this design requires a separate logic to walk through the; entire type hierarchy to check type compatibility of bounds annotations. Late parsing for C; ==================. A bounds annotation such as ``__counted_by(count)`` can be added to type of a; struct field declaration where count is another field of the same struct; declared later. Similarly, the annotation may apply to type of a function; parameter declaration which precedes the parameter count in the same function.; This means parsing the argument of bounds annotations must be done after the; parser has the whole context of a struct or a function declaration. Clang has; late parsing logic for C++ declaration attributes that require late parsing,; while the C declaration attributes and C/C++ type attributes do not have the; same logic.

For instance,; a pointer dereference on a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer will return the; dereferenced value same as plain C pointers, modulo the extra bounds checks; being performed before dereferencing the wide pointer.

Testability," You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it. In order to test the post register allocation; pseudo instruction expansion pass on X86-64, a run line like the one shown; below can be used:. ``# RUN: llc -o - %s -mtriple=x86_64-- -run-pass=postrapseudos | FileCheck %s``. The MIR files are target dependent, so they have to be placed in the target; specific test directories (``lib/CodeGen/TARGETNAME``). They also need to; specify a target triple or a target architecture either in the run line or in; the embedded LLVM IR module. Simplifying MIR files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The MIR code coming out of ``-stop-after``/``-stop-before`` is very verbose;; Tests are more accessible and future proof when simplified:. - Use the ``-simplify-mir`` option with llc. - Machine function attributes often have default values or the test works just; as well with default values. Typical candidates for this are: `alignment:`,; `exposesReturnsTwice`, `legalized`, `regBankSelected`, `selected`.; The whole `frameInfo` section is often unnecessary if there is no special; frame usage in the function. `tracksRegLiveness` on the other hand is often; necessary for some passes that care about block livein lists. - The (global) `liveins:` list is typically only interesting for early; instruction selection passes and can be removed when testing late",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:2790,test,test,2790,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['test']

This can be surprising to people (and also matches; C semantics) where they assume that ""``X^X``"" is always zero, even if; ``X`` is undefined. This isn't true for a number of reasons, but the; short answer is that an '``undef``' ""variable"" can arbitrarily change; its value over its ""live range"". This is true because the variable; doesn't actually *have a live range*. Instead, the value is logically; read from arbitrary registers that happen to be around when needed, so; the value is not necessarily consistent over time. In fact, ``%A`` and; ``%C`` need to have the same semantics or the core LLVM ""replace all; uses with"" concept would not hold.

Say that ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` derive; from ``Square``, and so ``ShapeKind`` becomes:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; + SK_SpecialSquare,; + SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; SK_Circle; }. Then in ``Square``, we would need to modify the ``classof`` like so:. .. code-block:: c++. - static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; - return S->getKind() == SK_Square;; - }; + static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; + return S->getKind() >= SK_Square &&; + S->getKind() <= SK_OtherSpecialSquare;; + }. The reason that we need to test a range like this instead of just equality; is that both ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` ""is-a""; ``Square``, and so ``classof`` needs to return ``true`` for them. This approach can be made to scale to arbitrarily deep hierarchies. The; trick is that you arrange the enum values so that they correspond to a; preorder traversal of the class hierarchy tree. With that arrangement, all; subclass tests can be done with two comparisons as shown above. If you just; list the class hierarchy like a list of bullet points, you'll get the; ordering right::. | Shape; | Square; | SpecialSquare; | OtherSpecialSquare; | Circle. A Bug to be Aware Of; --------------------. The example just given opens the door to bugs where the ``classof``\s are; not updated to match the ``Kind`` enum when adding (or removing) classes to; (from) the hierarchy. Continuing the example above, suppose we add a ``SomewhatSpecialSquare`` as; a subclass of ``Square``, and update the ``ShapeKind`` enum like so:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; SK_SpecialSquare,; SK_Ot",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:8279,test,test,8279,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,1,['test'],['test']

There is also a MIR-level debugify pass that can be run before each backend; pass, see:; :ref:`Mutation testing for MIR-level transformations<MIRDebugify>`. ``debugify`` in regression tests; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The output of the ``debugify`` pass must be stable enough to use in regression; tests. Changes to this pass are not allowed to break existing tests. .. note::. Regression tests must be robust. Avoid hardcoding line/variable numbers in; check lines. In cases where this can't be avoided (say, if a test wouldn't; be precise enough), moving the test to its own file is preferred. .. _MIRDebugify:. Test original debug info preservation in optimizations; ------------------------------------------------------. In addition to automatically generating debug info, the checks provided by; the ``debugify`` utility pass can also be used to test the preservation of; pre-existing debug info metadata. It could be run as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. # Run the pass by checking original Debug Info preservation.; $ opt -verify-debuginfo-preserve -pass-to-test sample.ll. # Check the preservation of original Debug Info after each pass.; $ opt -verify-each-debuginfo-preserve -O2 sample.ll.

Please do note that running ``-verify-each-debuginfo-preserve`` on big projects; could be heavily time consuming.

Testability," a ``RecordDecl`` AST node).; However, we can now define ``X::f`` out-of-line:. .. code-block:: c++. void X::f(int x = 17) { /* ... */ }. This definition of ""``f``"" has different lexical and semantic contexts. The; lexical context corresponds to the declaration context in which the actual; declaration occurred in the source code, e.g., the translation unit containing; ``X``. Thus, this declaration of ``X::f`` can be found by traversing the; declarations provided by [``decls_begin()``, ``decls_end()``) in the; translation unit. The semantic context of ``X::f`` corresponds to the class ``X``, since this; member function is (semantically) a member of ``X``. Lookup of the name ``f``; into the ``DeclContext`` associated with ``X`` will then return the definition; of ``X::f`` (including information about the default argument). Transparent Declaration Contexts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C and C++, there are several contexts in which names that are logically; declared inside another declaration will actually ""leak"" out into the enclosing; scope from the perspective of name lookup. The most obvious instance of this; behavior is in enumeration types, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. enum Color {; Red,; Green,; Blue; };. Here, ``Color`` is an enumeration, which is a declaration context that contains; the enumerators ``Red``, ``Green``, and ``Blue``. Thus, traversing the list of; declarations contained in the enumeration ``Color`` will yield ``Red``,; ``Green``, and ``Blue``. However, outside of the scope of ``Color`` one can; name the enumerator ``Red`` without qualifying the name, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. Color c = Red;. There are other entities in C++ that provide similar behavior. For example,; linkage specifications that use curly braces:. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" {; void f(int);; void g(int);; }; // f and g are visible here.

Testability," a function that throws an exception in order to unwind the JIT'd; code's stack. Now we can construct our CompileOnDemandLayer. Following the pattern from; previous layers we start by passing a reference to the next layer down in our; stack -- the OptimizeLayer. Next we need to supply a 'partitioning function':; when a not-yet-compiled function is called, the CompileOnDemandLayer will call; this function to ask us what we would like to compile. At a minimum we need to; compile the function being called (given by the argument to the partitioning; function), but we could also request that the CompileOnDemandLayer compile other; functions that are unconditionally called (or highly likely to be called) from; the function being called. For KaleidoscopeJIT we'll keep it simple and just; request compilation of the function that was called. Next we pass a reference to; our CompileCallbackManager. Finally, we need to supply an ""indirect stubs; manager builder"": a utility function that constructs IndirectStubManagers, which; are in turn used to build the stubs for the functions in each module. The; CompileOnDemandLayer will call the indirect stub manager builder once for each; call to addModule, and use the resulting indirect stubs manager to create; stubs for all functions in all modules in the set. If/when the module set is; removed from the JIT the indirect stubs manager will be deleted, freeing any; memory allocated to the stubs.

Testability," a good idea to use a trailing wildcard to allow for; unexpected suffixes. Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work. However, it would; prevent a ``grep freebsd`` from finding this test. Better to use:; ``target={{.+-freebsd.*}} || target={{.+-netbsd.*}}``. Substitutions; -------------. Besides replacing LLVM tool names the following substitutions are performed in; RUN lines:. ``%%``; Replaced by a single ``%``.

Example: ``/home/user/llvm/test/MC/ELF``. ``%t``; File path to a temporary file name that could be used for this test case.; The file name won't conflict with other test cases.

Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------.

Testability," and don't; inherently leak data, this is expected to be prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details. There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction tha",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15319,test,testl,15319,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['test'],['testl']

If any of the passes crash, or if they produce malformed output (which; causes the verifier to abort), ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_. Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output. Once ``bugpoint`` has a reference output for the; test program, it tries executing it with the selected code generator. If the; selected code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_ on; the code generator. Otherwise, if the resulting output differs from the; reference output, it assumes the difference resulted from a code generator; failure, and starts the `code generator debugger`_. Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it. If its output differs from the reference output, it assumes; the difference resulted from a failure in one of the LLVM passes, and enters the; `miscompilation debugger`_. Otherwise, there is no problem ``bugpoint`` can; debug. .. _crash debugger:. Crash debugger; --------------. If an optimizer or code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` will try as hard as it; can to reduce the list of passes (for optimizer crashes) and the size of the; test program.

This pass performs various transformations related to eliminating ``memcpy``; calls, or transforming sets of stores into ``memset``\ s. ``mergefunc``: Merge Functions; ------------------------------. This pass looks for equivalent functions that are mergeable and folds them. Total-ordering is introduced among the functions set: we define comparison; that answers for every two functions which of them is greater. It allows to; arrange functions into the binary tree. For every new function we check for equivalent in tree. If equivalent exists we fold such functions. If both functions are overridable,; we move the functionality into a new internal function and leave two; overridable thunks to it. If there is no equivalent, then we add this function to tree.

Ensure that functions have at most one ``ret`` instruction in them.; Additionally, it keeps track of which node is the new exit node of the CFG. ``partial-inliner``: Partial Inliner; ------------------------------------. This pass performs partial inlining, typically by inlining an ``if`` statement; that surrounds the body of the function. ``reassociate``: Reassociate expressions; ----------------------------------------.

Testability," and the resultant program could be used just like the standard ``grep``; tool. Positional arguments are sorted by their order of construction. This means that; command line options will be ordered according to how they are listed in a .cpp; file, but will not have an ordering defined if the positional arguments are; defined in multiple .cpp files. The fix for this problem is simply to define; all of your positional arguments in one .cpp file. Specifying positional options with hyphens; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes you may want to specify a value to your positional argument that; starts with a hyphen (for example, searching for '``-foo``' in a file). At; first, you will have trouble doing this, because it will try to find an argument; named '``-foo``', and will fail (and single quotes will not save you). Note; that the system ``grep`` has the same problem:. ::. $ spiffygrep '-foo' test.txt; Unknown command line argument '-foo'. Try: spiffygrep -help'. $ grep '-foo' test.txt; grep: illegal option -- f; grep: illegal option -- o; grep: illegal option -- o; Usage: grep -hblcnsviw pattern file . . . The solution for this problem is the same for both your tool and the system; version: use the '``--``' marker. When the user specifies '``--``' on the; command line, it is telling the program that all options after the '``--``'; should be treated as positional arguments, not options. Thus, we can use it; like this:. ::. $ spiffygrep -- -foo test.txt; ...output... Determining absolute position with getPosition(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes an option can affect or modify the meaning of another option. For; example, consider ``gcc``'s ``-x LANG`` option. This tells ``gcc`` to ignore the; suffix of subsequent positional arguments and force the file to be interpreted; as if it contained source code in language ``LANG``. In order to handle this; properly, you need to know the absolute position of each argument, especially; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:28134,test,test,28134,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['test'],['test']

The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the; :doc:`Testing Guide <TestingGuide>` for details). * Test cases should be written in :doc:`LLVM assembly language <LangRef>`. * Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,; by :doc:`bugpoint <Bugpoint>` or manually. It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links. Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature; tests only. More extensive test cases (e.g., entire applications, benchmarks,; etc) should be added to the ``llvm-test`` test suite. The llvm-test suite is; for coverage (correctness, performance, etc) testing, not feature or regression; testing. Release Notes; -------------.

If you try; vec_align.ll without -relocation-model=static, you'll see what I mean. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. We should lower store(fneg(load p), q) into an integer load+xor+store, which; eliminates a constant pool load. For example, consider:. define i64 @ccosf(float %z.0, float %z.1) nounwind readonly {; entry:; %tmp6 = fsub float -0.000000e+00, %z.1		; <float> [#uses=1]; %tmp20 = tail call i64 @ccoshf( float %tmp6, float %z.0 ) nounwind readonly; ret i64 %tmp20; }; declare i64 @ccoshf(float %z.0, float %z.1) nounwind readonly. This currently compiles to:.

Note the load into xmm0, then xor (to negate), then store. In PIC mode,; this code computes the pic base and does two loads to do the constant pool ; load, so the improvement is much bigger. The tricky part about this xform is that the argument load/store isn't exposed; until post-legalize, and at that point, the fneg has been custom expanded into ; an X86 fxor.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it.

Testability," are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates; and uniques them as they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"".

The macro shows the easiest way of accessing the content of a n-tuple:; after loading the n-tuple, its branches are assigned to variables and; `GetEntry(long)` automatically fills them with the content for a; specific row.

The test-suite comes with several CMake caches which; predefine common or tricky build configurations. Displaying and Analyzing Results; --------------------------------. The `compare.py` script displays and compares result files. A result file is; produced when invoking lit with the `-o filename.json` flag. Example usage:. - Basic Usage:. ```text; % test-suite/utils/compare.py baseline.json; Warning: 'test-suite :: External/SPEC/CINT2006/403.gcc/403.gcc.test' has No metrics!; Tests: 508; Metric: exec_time.

Testability," as for example `POCL <http://portablecl.org/>`_, can be used. This target does not support multiple memory segments and, therefore, the fake; address space map can be added using the :ref:`-ffake-address-space-map; <opencl_fake_address_space_map>` flag. All known OpenCL extensions and features are set to supported in the generic targets,; however :option:`-cl-ext` flag can be used to toggle individual extensions and; features. .. _opencl_header:. OpenCL Header; -------------. By default Clang will include standard headers and therefore most of OpenCL; builtin functions and types are available during compilation. The; default declarations of non-native compiler types and functions can be disabled; by using flag :option:`-cl-no-stdinc`. The following example demonstrates that OpenCL kernel sources with various; standard builtin functions can be compiled without the need for an explicit; includes or compiler flags. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""bool is_wg_uniform(int i){return get_enqueued_local_size(i)==get_local_size(i);}"" > test.cl; $ clang -cl-std=CL2.0 test.cl. More information about the default headers is provided in :doc:`OpenCLSupport`. OpenCL Extensions; -----------------. Most of the ``cl_khr_*`` extensions to OpenCL C from `the official OpenCL; registry <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/>`_ are available and; configured per target depending on the support available in the specific; architecture. It is possible to alter the default extensions setting per target using; ``-cl-ext`` flag. (See :ref:`flags description <opencl_cl_ext>` for more details). Vendor extensions can be added flexibly by declaring the list of types and; functions associated with each extensions enclosed within the following; compiler pragma directives:. .. code-block:: c. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION the_new_extension_name : begin; // declare types and functions associated with the extension here; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION the_new_extension_name : end.

Testability," as separate efforts to integrate LLVM development with local practices. It is the responsibility of each sub-community to care about their own parts; and the intersection of that with the core tier and other peripheral parts. There are three main groups of code that fit in this category:; * Code that is making its way into LLVM, via the `experimental <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#introducing-new-components-into-llvm>`_; roadmap or similar efforts.; * Code that is making its way out of LLVM, via deprecation, replacement or; bit-rot, and will be removed if the sub-community that cares about it; cannot maintain it.; * Code that isn't meant to be in LLVM core and can coexist with the code in; the core tier (and others in the peripheral tier) long term, without causing; breakages or disturbances. What is covered; ---------------. The peripheral tier is composed of:; * Experimental targets and options that haven't been enable by default yet.; * Main repository projects that don't get released or regularly tested.; * Legacy tools and scripts that aren't used in upstream validation.; * Alternative build systems (ex. GN, Bazel) and related infrastructure.; * Tools support (ex. gdb scripts, editor configuration, helper scripts). Requirements; ------------. Code in this tier must:; * Have a clear benefit for residing in the main repository, catering to an; active sub-community (upstream or downstream).; * Be actively maintained by such sub-community and have its problems addressed; in a timely manner. Code in this tier must **not**:; * Break or invalidate core tier code or infrastructure. If that happens; accidentally, reverting functionality and working on the issues offline; is the only acceptable course of action.; * Negatively affect development of core tier code, with the sub-community; involved responsible for making changes to address specific concerns.; * Negatively affect other peripheral tier code, with the sub-communities; involved tasked to resolve th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst:4502,test,tested,4502,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,1,['test'],['tested']
Testability," as source and destination; arguments. If a copy operation takes a safepoint it might need to relocate the; underlying source and destination objects. This requires the corresponding base; pointers to be available in the copy operation. In order to make the base; pointers available RewriteStatepointsForGC replaces derived pointers with base; pointer and offset pairs. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. declare void @__llvm_memcpy_element_unordered_atomic_safepoint_1(; i8 addrspace(1)* %dest_base, i64 %dest_offset,; i8 addrspace(1)* %src_base, i64 %src_offset,; i64 %length). .. _PlaceSafepoints:. PlaceSafepoints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The pass PlaceSafepoints inserts safepoint polls sufficient to ensure running; code checks for a safepoint request on a timely manner. This pass is expected; to be run before RewriteStatepointsForGC and thus does not produce full; relocation sequences. As an example, given input IR of the following:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @test() gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void @foo(); ret void; }. declare void @do_safepoint(); define void @gc.safepoint_poll() {; call void @do_safepoint(); ret void; }. This pass would produce the following IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @test() gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void @do_safepoint(); call void @foo(); ret void; }. In this case, we've added an (unconditional) entry safepoint poll. Note that; despite appearances, the entry poll is not necessarily redundant. We'd have to; know that ``foo`` and ``test`` were not mutually recursive for the poll to be; redundant. In practice, you'd probably want to your poll definition to contain; a conditional branch of some form. At the moment, PlaceSafepoints can insert safepoint polls at method entry and; loop backedges locations. Extending this to work with return polls would be; straight forward if desired. PlaceSafepoints includes a number of optimizations to avoid placing safepoint; polls at particular sites unless needed to ensure timely execution o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst:31818,test,test,31818,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability," as the first line of the; method. If that still doesn't remove enough, then change the caller of; ``InstCombiner::DoOneIteration``, ``InstCombiner::runOnFunction`` to limit the; number of iterations. You may also find it useful to use ""``-stats``"" now to see what parts of; instcombine are firing. This can guide where to put additional reporting code. At this point, if the amount of transformations is still too large, then; inserting code to limit whether or not to execute the body of the code in the; visit function can be helpful. Add a static counter which is incremented on; every invocation of the function. Then add code which simply returns false on; desired ranges. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. static int calledCount = 0;; calledCount++;; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount < 212) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount > 217) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount == 213) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount == 214) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount == 215) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(if (calledCount == 216) return false);; LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() << ""visitXOR calledCount: "" << calledCount << ""\n"");; LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() << ""I: ""; I->dump());. could be added to ``visitXOR`` to limit ``visitXor`` to being applied only to; calls 212 and 217. This is from an actual test case and raises an important; point---a simple binary search may not be sufficient, as transformations that; interact may require isolating more than one call. In TargetLowering, use; ``return SDNode();`` instead of ``return false;``. Now that the number of transformations is down to a manageable number, try; examining the output to see if you can figure out which transformations are; being done. If that can be figured out, then do the usual debugging. If which; code corresponds to the transformation being performed isn't obvious, set a; breakpoint after the call count based disabling and step through the code.; Alternatively, you can use ""``printf``"" style debugging to report waypoints.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:10673,test,test,10673,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['test'],['test']

It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt. Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test. A follow-up patch with code changes to the compiler will then show check-line; differences to the tests, so it is easier to see the effect of the patch.; Remove TODO/FIXME comments added in the previous step if a problem is solved. Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary.

It enables:. - Decoupling of producers (geometry packages etc) who model collection; of 3D objects from consumers (viewers) which display them. - Producer code free of explicit drawing commands & viewer specific; branching. - Support differing viewers and clients capabilities, e.g. - Mix of native (in viewer) shapes and generic client side; tessellation. - Local/global frame object description. - Bounding boxes. - Placing copies sharing common geometry (logical/physical shapes).

As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases. See; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for examples. * `trackAssignments` doesn't yet work for variables that have their; `llvm.dbg.declare` location modified by a `DIExpression`, e.g. when the; address of the variable is itself stored in an `alloca` with the; `llvm.dbg.declare` using `DIExpression(DW_OP_deref)`. See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment. To solve; this we probably need another marker intrinsic to denote ""the variable's; stack home is X address"" - similar to `llvm.dbg.declare` except that it needs; to compose with `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics such that the stack home address; is only selected as a location for the variable when the `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics agree it should be. * Given the above (a special ""the stack home is X"" intrinsic), and the fact; that we can only track assignments with fixed offsets and sizes, I think we; can probably get rid of the address and address-expression part, since it; will always be computable with the info we have.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:10362,test,test,10362,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``).

Testability," call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```. To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API. JSROOT defines the TFile class, which can be used to access binary ROOT files.; One should always remember that all I/O operations are asynchronous in JSROOT.; Therefore promises are used to retrieve results when the I/O operation is completed.; For example, reading an object from a file and displaying it will look like:. ```javascript; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; let file = await openFile(filename);; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpxpy;1"");; await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('drawing completed');; ```. Here is [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_root_file) and [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_file.htm). ### TTree API. Simple TTree::Draw operation can be performed with following code:. ```javascript; import { openFile } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/io.mjs';; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/draw.mjs';; let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let tree = await file.readObject(""ntuple;1"");; draw(""drawing"", tree, ""px:py::pz>5"");; ```. To get access to selected branches, one should use `TSelector` class:. ```javascript; import { openFile } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/io.mjs';; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/draw.mjs';; import { TSelector, treeProcess } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/tree.mjs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let tree = awai",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:40324,log,log,40324,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,1,['log'],['log']

PowerPC constraints:. * No variable argument lists are used. * No byval parameters are used. * On ppc32/64 GOT/PIC only module-local calls (visibility = hidden or protected); are supported. WebAssembly constraints:. * No variable argument lists are used. * The 'tail-call' target attribute is enabled. * The caller and callee's return types must match. The caller cannot; be void unless the callee is, too. AArch64 constraints:. * No variable argument lists are used. Example:. Call as ``llc -tailcallopt test.ll``. .. code-block:: llvm. declare fastcc i32 @tailcallee(i32 inreg %a1, i32 inreg %a2, i32 %a3, i32 %a4). define fastcc i32 @tailcaller(i32 %in1, i32 %in2) {; %l1 = add i32 %in1, %in2; %tmp = tail call fastcc i32 @tailcallee(i32 inreg %in1, i32 inreg %in2, i32 %in1, i32 %l1); ret i32 %tmp; }. Implications of ``-tailcallopt``:. To support tail call optimization in situations where the callee has more; arguments than the caller a 'callee pops arguments' convention is used. This; currently causes each ``fastcc`` call that is not tail call optimized (because; one or more of above constraints are not met) to be followed by a readjustment; of the stack. So performance might be worse in such cases. Sibling call optimization; -------------------------. Sibling call optimization is a restricted form of tail call optimization.; Unlike tail call optimization described in the previous section, it can be; performed automatically on any tail calls when ``-tailcallopt`` option is no",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:87524,test,test,87524,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['test'],['test']

By default, all subjects in the SubjectList must either be a Decl node defined; in ``DeclNodes.td``, or a statement node defined in ``StmtNodes.td``. However,; more complex subjects can be created by creating a ``SubsetSubject`` object.; Each such object has a base subject which it appertains to (which must be a; Decl or Stmt node, and not a SubsetSubject node), and some custom code which is; called when determining whether an attribute appertains to the subject. For; instance, a ``NonBitField`` SubsetSubject appertains to a ``FieldDecl``, and; tests whether the given FieldDecl is a bit field. When a SubsetSubject is; specified in a SubjectList, a custom diagnostic parameter must also be provided. Diagnostic checking for attribute subject lists for declaration and statement; attributes is automated except when ``HasCustomParsing`` is set to ``1``. Documentation; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~; All attributes must have some form of documentation associated with them.; Documentation is table generated on the public web server by a server-side; process that runs daily.

The X86 backend; ---------------. The X86 code generator lives in the ``lib/Target/X86`` directory. This code; generator is capable of targeting a variety of x86-32 and x86-64 processors, and; includes support for ISA extensions such as MMX and SSE. X86 Target Triples supported; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The following are the known target triples that are supported by the X86; backend. This is not an exhaustive list, and it would be useful to add those; that people test. * **i686-pc-linux-gnu** --- Linux. * **i386-unknown-freebsd5.3** --- FreeBSD 5.3. * **i686-pc-cygwin** --- Cygwin on Win32. * **i686-pc-mingw32** --- MingW on Win32. * **i386-pc-mingw32msvc** --- MingW crosscompiler on Linux. * **i686-apple-darwin*** --- Apple Darwin on X86. * **x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu** --- Linux.

Testability," can be retrieved; using ``getParamElementType()``. This attribute is required in cases where; the intrinsic does not naturally encode a needed element type. This is also; used for inline assembly. Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------. Frontends need to be adjusted to track pointee types independently of LLVM,; insofar as they are necessary for lowering. For example, clang now tracks the; pointee type in the ``Address`` structure. Frontends using the C API through an FFI interface should be aware that a; number of C API functions are deprecated and will be removed as part of the; opaque pointer transi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:9055,test,test,9055,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability," can catch a lot of bugs. Once the; function is finished and validated, we return it. .. code-block:: c++. // Error reading body, remove function.; TheFunction->eraseFromParent();; return nullptr;; }. The only piece left here is handling of the error case. For simplicity,; we handle this by merely deleting the function we produced with the; ``eraseFromParent`` method. This allows the user to redefine a function; that they incorrectly typed in before: if we didn't delete it, it would; live in the symbol table, with a body, preventing future redefinition. This code does have a bug, though: If the ``FunctionAST::codegen()`` method; finds an existing IR Function, it does not validate its signature against the; definition's own prototype. This means that an earlier 'extern' declaration will; take precedence over the function definition's signature, which can cause; codegen to fail, for instance if the function arguments are named differently.; There are a number of ways to fix this bug, see what you can come up with! Here; is a testcase:. ::. extern foo(a); # ok, defines foo.; def foo(b) b; # Error: Unknown variable name. (decl using 'a' takes precedence). Driver Changes and Closing Thoughts; ===================================. For now, code generation to LLVM doesn't really get us much, except that; we can look at the pretty IR calls. The sample code inserts calls to; codegen into the ""``HandleDefinition``"", ""``HandleExtern``"" etc; functions, and then dumps out the LLVM IR. This gives a nice way to look; at the LLVM IR for simple functions. For example:. ::. ready> 4+5;; Read top-level expression:; define double @0() {; entry:; ret double 9.000000e+00; }. Note how the parser turns the top-level expression into anonymous; functions for us. This will be handy when we add `JIT; support <LangImpl04.html#adding-a-jit-compiler>`_ in the next chapter.

[Remember that ``$LLVM_GCC_DIR`` is the directory where you; *installed* llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.]. #. You can now run the test suite from your build tree as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT/projects/test-suite; % make. Note that the second and third steps only need to be done once. After; you have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it; again (unless the test code or configure script changes). Configuring External Tests; ==========================. In order to run the External tests in the ``test-suite`` module, you; must specify *--with-externals*. This must be done during the; *re-configuration* step (see above), and the ``llvm`` re-configuration; must recognize the previously-built ``llvm-gcc``. If any of these is; missing or neglected, the External tests won't work. * *--with-externals*. * *--with-externals=<directory>*. This tells LLVM where to find any external tests. They are expected to; be in specifically named subdirectories of <``directory``>. If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``.

This will create a new branch called ``arcpatch-D<Revision>`` based on the; current ``main`` and will create a commit corresponding to ``D<Revision>`` with a; commit message derived from information in the Phabricator review. Check you are happy with the commit message and amend it if necessary.; For example, ensure the 'Author' property of the commit is set to the original author.; You can use a command to correct the author property if it is incorrect:. ::. git commit --amend --author=""John Doe <jdoe@llvm.org>"". Then, make sure the commit is up-to-date, and commit it. This can be done by running; the following:. ::. git pull --rebase https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git main; git show # Ensure the patch looks correct.; ninja check-$whatever # Rerun the appropriate tests if needed.; git push https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git HEAD:main.

Testability," code. It's distinctive enough that character sequences that look like the start; or end of a markup element should rarely if ever appear incidentally in logging; text. It's specifically intended not to require sanitizing plain text, such as; the HTML/XML requirement to replace ``<`` with ``&lt;`` and the like. :doc:`llvm-symbolizer <CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer>` includes a symbolizing; filter via its ``--filter-markup`` option. Also, LLVM utilites emit stack; traces as markup when the ``LLVM_ENABLE_SYMBOLIZER_MARKUP`` environment; variable is set. Scope and assumptions; =====================. A symbolizing filter implementation will be independent both of the target; operating system and machine architecture where the logs are generated and of; the host operating system and machine architecture where the filter runs. This format assumes that the symbolizing filter processes intact whole lines. If; long lines might be split during some stage of a logging pipeline, they must be; reassembled to restore the original line breaks before feeding lines into the; symbolizing filter. Most markup elements must appear entirely on a single line; (often with other text before and/or after the markup element). There are some; markup elements that are specified to span lines, with line breaks in the middle; of the element. Even in those cases, the filter is not expected to handle line; breaks in arbitrary places inside a markup element, but only inside certain; fields. This format assumes that the symbolizing filter processes a coherent stream of; log lines from a single process address space context. If a logging stream; interleaves log lines from more than one process, these must be collated into; separate per-process log streams and each stream processed by a separate; instance of the symbolizing filter. Because the kernel and user processes use; disjoint address regions in most operating systems, a single user process; address space plus the kernel address space can be treate",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:2372,log,logging,2372,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['log'],['logging']

The support for X86 (both 32-bit and 64-bit) is considered stable on; Darwin (macOS), Linux, FreeBSD, and Dragonfly BSD: it has been tested; to correctly compile many large C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++; codebases. On ``x86_64-mingw32``, passing i128(by value) is incompatible with the; Microsoft x64 calling convention. You might need to tweak; ``WinX86_64ABIInfo::classify()`` in lib/CodeGen/Targets/X86.cpp. For the X86 target, clang supports the `-m16` command line; argument which enables 16-bit code output. This is broadly similar to; using ``asm("".code16gcc"")`` with the GNU toolchain. The generated code; and the ABI remains 32-bit but the assembler emits instructions; appropriate for a CPU running in 16-bit mode, with address-size and; operand-size prefixes to enable 32-bit addressing and operations. Several micro-architecture levels as specified by the x86-64 psABI are defined.; They are cumulative in the sense that features from previous levels are; implicitly included in later levels. - ``-march=x86-64``: CMOV, CMPXCHG8B, FPU, FXSR, MMX, FXSR, SCE, SSE, SSE2; - ``-march=x86-64-v2`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:156718,test,tested,156718,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability," different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================.

Testability," do not split the header; ```. ### Streamers with Special Additions. Most of the time you can let `rootcling` generate a `Streamer` for you.; However if you want to write your own `Streamer `you can do so. For some; classes, it may be necessary to execute some code before or after the; read or write block in the automatic `Streamer`. For example after the; execution of the read block, one can initialize some non persistent; members. There are two reasons why you would need to write your own; Streamer: 1) if you have a non-persistent data member that you want to; initialize to a value depending on the read data members; 2) if you want; or need to handle the schema evolution on your own. Note that an alternative; for those cases is to consider write a schema evolution rule. First, you need to tell `rootcling` not to build a `Streamer `for you.; The input to the `rootcling` command (in the `makefile`) is a list of; classes in a `LinkDef.h` file. For example, the list of classes for; `Event` is listed in `$ROOTSYS/test/EventLinkDef.h`. The ""`-`"" at the; end of the class name tells `rootcling` not to generate a `Streamer`. In; the example, you can see the `Event` class is the only one for which; `rootcling` is instructed not to generate a `Streamer`. ``` {.cpp}; #ifdef __ROOTCLING__. #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; #pragma link C++ class Event-;; #pragma link C++ class HistogramManager+;; #pragma link C++ class Track+;. #endif; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; ```. The ""`+`"" sign tells `rootcling` to use the new `Streamer `system; introduced in ROOT 3.0. The following is an example of a customized; `Streamer `for `Event`. The `Streamer` takes a **`TBuffer`** as a; parameter, and first checks to see if this is a case of reading or; writing the buffer. ``` {.cpp}; void Event::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b) {; if (R__b.IsReading()) {; Event::Class()->ReadBuffer(R__b, this);; f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:49995,test,test,49995,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['test'],['test']

If any tests did fail, the; Failing Tests (count): message will be followed by a list; of the test source file paths that failed. For example:. Failing Tests (3):; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/member-name-lookup.cpp; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/namespace-alias.cpp; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/using-directive.cpp. If you used the make VERBOSE=1 option, the terminal; output will reflect the error messages from the compiler and; test runner.; The regression suite can also be run with Valgrind by running; make test VG=1 in the top-level clang directory.; For more intensive changes, running; the LLVM; Test Suite with clang is recommended.

C API Changes; -------------. * Stability Guarantees: The C API is, in general, a ""best effort"" for stability.; This means that we make every attempt to keep the C API stable, but that; stability will be limited by the abstractness of the interface and the; stability of the C++ API that it wraps. In practice, this means that things; like ""create debug info"" or ""create this type of instruction"" are likely to be; less stable than ""take this IR file and JIT it for my current machine"". * Release stability: We won't break the C API on the release branch with patches; that go on that branch, with the exception that we will fix an unintentional; C API break that will keep the release consistent with both the previous and; next release. * Testing: Patches to the C API are expected to come with tests just like any; other patch. * Including new things into the API: If an LLVM subcomponent has a C API already; included, then expanding that C API is acceptable. Adding C API for; subcomponents that don't currently have one needs to be discussed on the; `LLVM Discourse forums`_ for design and maintainability feedback prior to implementation. * Documentation: Any changes to the C API are required to be documented in the; release notes so that it's clear to external users who do not follow the; project how the C API is changing and evolving. .. _toolchain:.

The following sections are examples of writing and reading trees; increasing in complexity from a simple tree with a few variables to a; tree containing folders and complex Event objects. Each example has a; named script in the `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree` directory. They are called; tree1.C to tree4.C. The examples are:. - `tree1.C`: a tree with several simple (integers and floating point); variables. - `tree2.C`: a tree built from a C structure (`struct`). This example; uses the `Geant3` C wrapper as an example of a FORTRAN common block; ported to C with a C structure. - `tree3.C:` in this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a; branch from another tree with the Friends feature. These trees have; branches with variable length arrays. Each entry has a variable; number of tracks, and each track has several variables. - `tree4.C:` a tree with a class (`Event`). The class Event is defined; in `$ROOTSYS/test`. In this example we first encounter the impact of; splitting a branch. Each script contains the main function, with the same name as the file; (i.e. `tree1`), the function to write - `tree1w`, and the function to; read - `tree1r`. If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the; tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you; can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a; specific function. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; // execute the function that writes, reads, shows the tree; root[] x tree1.C; // use ACLiC to build shared library, check syntax, execute; root[] x tree1.C++; // Load the script and select a function to execute; root[] L tree1.C; root[] tree1w(); root[] tree1r(); ```. ## Example 1: A Tree with Simple Variables.

For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm. By default, clang will generate profile data by compiling a simple; hello world program. You can also tell clang use an external; project for generating profile data that may be a better fit for your; use case. The project you specify must either be a lit test suite; (use the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DATA option) or a CMake project (use the; CLANG_PERF_TRAINING_DATA_SOURCE_DIR option). For example, If you wanted to use the; `LLVM Test Suite <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite/>`_ to generate; profile data you would use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DBOOTSTRAP_CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DATA_SOURCE_DIR=<path to llvm-test-suite> \; -DBOOTSTRAP_CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DEPS=runtimes. The BOOTSTRAP\_ prefixes tells CMake to pass the variables on to the instrumented; stage two build. And the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DEPS option let's you specify; additional build targets to build before building the external project. The; LLVM Test Suite requires compiler-rt to build, so we need to add the; `runtimes` target as a dependency. After configuration, building the stage2-instrumented-generate-profdata target; will automatically build the stage1 compiler, build the instrumented compiler; with the stage1 compiler, and then run the instrumented compiler against the; perf training data:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja stage2-instrumented-generate-profdata. If you let that run for a few hours or so, it will place a profdata file in your; build directory.

Testability," example, lets say we are developing a replacement for the standard; Unix Bourne shell (``/bin/sh``). To run ``/bin/sh``, first you specify options; to the shell itself (like ``-x`` which turns on trace output), then you specify; the name of the script to run, then you specify arguments to the script. These; arguments to the script are parsed by the Bourne shell command line option; processor, but are not interpreted as options to the shell itself. Using the; CommandLine library, we would specify this as:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> Script(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input script>""), cl::init(""-""));; cl::list<string> Argv(cl::ConsumeAfter, cl::desc(""<program arguments>...""));; cl::opt<bool> Trace(""x"", cl::desc(""Enable trace output""));. which automatically provides the help output:. ::. USAGE: spiffysh [options] <input script> <program arguments>... OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -x - Enable trace output. At runtime, if we run our new shell replacement as ```spiffysh -x test.sh -a -x; -y bar``', the ``Trace`` variable will be set to true, the ``Script`` variable; will be set to ""``test.sh``"", and the ``Argv`` list will contain ``[""-a"", ""-x"",; ""-y"", ""bar""]``, because they were specified after the last positional argument; (which is the script name). There are several limitations to when ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` options can be; specified. For example, only one ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` can be specified per; program, there must be at least one `positional argument`_ specified, there must; not be any `cl::list`_ positional arguments, and the ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` option; should be a `cl::list`_ option. .. _can be changed:; .. _Internal vs External Storage:.

It offers guaranteed log(n) performance, which is not particularly; fast from a complexity standpoint (particularly if the elements of the set are; expensive to compare, like strings), and has extremely high constant factors for; lookup, insertion and removal. The advantages of std::set are that its iterators are stable (deleting or; inserting an element from the set does not affect iterators or pointers to other; elements) and that iteration over the set is guaranteed to be in sorted order.; If the elements in the set are large, then the relative overhead of the pointers; and malloc traffic is not a big deal, but if the elements of the set are small,; std::set is almost never a good choice. .. _dss_setvector:. llvm/ADT/SetVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Cross Compilation and External Devices; --------------------------------------. ### Compilation. CMake allows to cross compile to a different target via toolchain files. More; information can be found here:. - [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling). - [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html). Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command.

See; **`TH2`**`::ProfileX`,; **`TH2`**`::ProfileY, `**`TProfile`**`::ProjectionX`,; **`TProfile2D`**`::ProjectionXY`, **`TH2`**`::ProjectionX`,; **`TH2`**`::ProjectionY` . - a 1-D, 2-D or profile out of a 3-D histogram see; **`TH3`**`::ProjectionZ`, **`TH3`**`::Project3D`. These projections can be fit via: **`TH2`**`::FitSlicesX`,; **`TH2`**`::FitSlicesY`, **`TH3`**`::FitSlicesZ`. ## Drawing Histograms. When you call the `Draw` method of a histogram ( **`TH1`**` ::Draw` ); for the first time, it creates a **`THistPainter`** object and saves a; pointer to painter as a data member of the histogram. The; **`THistPainter`** class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It; allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is; using. The **`THistPainter`** class is separated from the histogram so; that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for; example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its; own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two; histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the; painter's values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do; not have to call the `Draw` method again. The image is refreshed the; next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these; three actions:. - A carriage control on the ROOT command line. - A click inside the pad. - A call to **`TPad`**`::Update()`. By default, the **`TH1`**`::Draw` clears the pad before drawing the; new image of the histogram. You can use the `""SAME""` option to leave; the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The; same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in; different pads.

Testability," having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt. Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization.

How should you respond if someone reverted your change?. * Remember, it is normal and healthy to have patches reverted. Having a patch; reverted does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong.; * We encourage explicitly thanking the person who reverted the patch for doing; the task on your behalf.; * If you need more information to address the problem, please follow up in the; original commit thread with the reverting patch author. When should you revert your own change?. * Any time you learn of a serious problem with a change, you should revert it.; We strongly encourage ""revert to green"" as opposed to ""fixing forward"". We; encourage reverting first, investigating offline, and then reapplying the; fixed patch - possibly after another round of review if warranted.; * If you break a buildbot in a way which can't be quickly fixed, please revert.; * If a test case that demonstrates a problem is reported in the commit thread,; please revert and investigate offline.; * If you receive substantial :ref:`post-commit review <post_commit_review>`; feedback, please revert and address said feedback before recommitting.; (Possibly after another round of review.); * If you are asked to revert by another contributor, please revert and discuss; the merits of the request offline (unless doing so would further destabilize; tip of tree).

Testability," histogram is filled; with a weight. If the weight is not explicitly specified it is assumed; to be 1. For example, this selection will add 1 to the histogram if x is less; than y and the square root of z is less than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; ```. On the other hand, this selection will add `x+y` to the histogram if the; square root of z is larger than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; ```. The `Draw` method has its own parser, and it only looks in the current; tree for variables. This means that any variable used in the selection; must be defined in the tree. You cannot use an arbitrary global variable; in the `TTree::Draw` method. ### Using TCut Objects in TTree::Draw. The `TTree::Draw` method also accepts **`TCutG`** objects. A; **`TCut`** is a specialized string object used for **`TTree`**; selections. A **`TCut`** object has a name and a title. It does not have; any data members in addition to what it inherits from **`TNamed`**. It; only adds a set of operators to do logical string concatenation. For; example, assume:. ``` {.cpp}; TCut cut1 = ""x<1""; TCut cut2 = ""y>2""; ```. then. ``` {.cpp}; cut1 && cut2; //result is the string ""(x<1)&&(y>2)""; ```. Operators =, +=, +, \*, !, &&, || are overloaded, here are some; examples:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCut c1 = ""x < 1""; root[] TCut c2 = ""y < 0""; root[] TCut c3 = c1 && c2; root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 || ""x>0""); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 && c2); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", ""(x + y)"" * (c1 && c2)); ```. ### Accessing the Histogram in Batch Mode. The `TTree::Draw` method creates a histogram called `htemp` and puts it; on the active pad. In a batch program, the histogram `htemp` created by; default, is reachable from the current pad. ``` {.cpp}; // draw the histogram; nt->Draw(""x"", ""cuts"");; // get the histogram from the current pad; TH1F *htemp = (TH1F*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""htemp"");; // now we have full use of the histogram; htemp->GetEntries();; ```.

Clang supports the pragma ``#pragma clang deprecated``, which can be used to; provide deprecation warnings for macro uses. For example:. .. code-block:: c. #define MIN(x, y) x < y ? x : y; #pragma clang deprecated(MIN, ""use std::min instead""). int min(int a, int b) {; return MIN(a, b); // warning: MIN is deprecated: use std::min instead; }. ``#pragma clang deprecated`` should be preferred for this purpose over; ``#pragma GCC warning`` because the warning can be controlled with; ``-Wdeprecated``.

This can be valuable when providing; headers with ABI stability requirements. Any expansion of the annotated macro; processed by the preprocessor after the ``#pragma`` annotation will log a; warning.

Testability," important part of the LLVM system, because LLVM; passes are where most of the interesting parts of the compiler exist. Passes; perform the transformations and optimizations that make up the compiler, they; build the analysis results that are used by these transformations, and they; are, above all, a structuring technique for compiler code. Unlike passes under the legacy pass manager where the pass interface is; defined via inheritance, passes under the new pass manager rely on; concept-based polymorphism, meaning there is no explicit interface (see; comments in ``PassManager.h`` for more details). All LLVM passes inherit from; the CRTP mix-in ``PassInfoMixin<PassT>``. The pass should have a ``run()``; method which returns a ``PreservedAnalyses`` and takes in some unit of IR; along with an analysis manager. For example, a function pass would have a; ``PreservedAnalyses run(Function &F, FunctionAnalysisManager &AM);`` method. We start by showing you how to construct a pass, from setting up the build,; creating the pass, to executing and testing it. Looking at existing passes is; always a great way to learn details. .. warning::; This document deals with the new pass manager. LLVM uses the legacy pass; manager for the codegen pipeline. For more details, see; :doc:`WritingAnLLVMPass` and :doc:`NewPassManager`. Quick Start --- Writing hello world; ===================================.

The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------. To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm.

For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled. To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM.

Testability," in memory](pictures/030001CE.png). Nodes are never instantiated directly by users, but created as a result; of volume operations. Adding a volume named A with a given `user id`; inside a volume B will create a node named `A_id.` This will be added to; the list of nodes stored by B. In addition, when applying a division; operation in N slices to a volume A, a list of nodes `B_1`, `B_2`, ... ,; `B_N` is also created. A node `B_i` does not represent a unique object; in the geometry because its container A might be at its turn positioned; as node inside several other volumes. Only when a complete branch of; nodes is fully defined up to the top node in the geometry, a given; path:` /TOP_1/`...`/A_3/B_7` will represent a unique object. Its global; transformation matrix can be computed as the pile-up of all local; transformations in its branch. We will therefore call `logical graph`; the hierarchy defined by nodes and volumes. The expansion of the logical; graph by all possible paths defines a tree structure where all nodes are; unique ""touchable"" objects. We will call this the ""physical tree"".; Unlike the logical graph, the physical tree can become a huge structure; with several millions of nodes in case of complex geometries; therefore,; it is not always a good idea to keep it transient in memory. Since the; logical and physical structures are correlated, the modeller rather; keeps track only of the current branch, updating the current global; matrix at each change of the level in geometry. The current physical; node is not an object that can be asked for at a given moment, but; rather represented by the combination: current node/current global; matrix. However, physical nodes have unique ID's that can be retrieved; for a given modeller state. These can be fed back to the modeller in; order to force a physical node to become current.

Also passes can be; replaced entirely so long as their task is complete as shown in this (more; customized) example pipeline. .. image:: pipeline-overview-customized.png. .. _maintainability-verifier:. MachineVerifier; ---------------. The pass approach lets us use the ``MachineVerifier`` to enforce invariants; that are required beyond certain points of the pipeline. For example, a; function with the ``legalized`` property can have the ``MachineVerifier``; enforce that no illegal instructions occur. Similarly, a; ``regBankSelected`` function may not have virtual registers without a register; bank assigned. .. note::. For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem. The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``.

Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------. To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On.

This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed.

On Linux, this is typically; ``/usr/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake``. * ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>`` is the root of the LLVM build tree. **Note: this is only; available when building LLVM with CMake.**. If LLVM is installed in your operating system's normal installation prefix (e.g.; on Linux this is usually ``/usr/``) ``find_package(LLVM ...)`` will; automatically find LLVM if it is installed correctly. If LLVM is not installed; or you wish to build directly against the LLVM build tree you can use; ``LLVM_DIR`` as previously mentioned. The ``LLVMConfig.cmake`` file sets various useful variables. Notable variables; include. ``LLVM_CMAKE_DIR``; The path to the LLVM CMake directory (i.e. the directory containing; LLVMConfig.cmake). ``LLVM_DEFINITIONS``; A list of preprocessor defines that should be used when building against LLVM. ``LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS``; This is set to ON if LLVM was built with assertions, otherwise OFF. ``LLVM_ENABLE_EH``; This is set to ON if LLVM was built with exception handling (EH) enabled,; otherwise OFF. ``LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI``; This is set to ON if LLVM was built with run time type information (RTTI),; otherwise OFF. ``LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS``; A list of include paths to directories containing LLVM header files. ``LLVM_PACKAGE_VERSION``; The LLVM version.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro9.C; ```.

Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst:3201,test,tester,3201,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,1,['test'],['tester']

Testability," jitlink-check: <expr>``. See; examples of this usage in ``llvm/test/ExecutionEngine/JITLink``. Remote execution via llvm-jitlink-executor; ------------------------------------------. By default ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the given objects into its own process,; but this can be overridden by two options:. The ``-oop-executor[=/path/to/executor]`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; execute the given executor (which defaults to ``llvm-jitlink-executor``) and; communicate with it via file descriptors which it passes to the executor; as the first argument with the format ``filedescs=<in-fd>,<out-fd>``. The ``-oop-executor-connect=<host>:<port>`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; connect to an already running executor via TCP on the given host and port. To; use this option you will need to start ``llvm-jitlink-executor`` manually with; ``listen=<host>:<port>`` as the first argument. Harness mode; ------------. The ``-harness`` option allows a set of input objects to be designated as a test; harness, with the regular object files implicitly treated as objects to be; tested. Definitions of symbols in the harness set override definitions in the; test set, and external references from the harness cause automatic scope; promotion of local symbols in the test set (these modifications to the usual; linker rules are accomplished via an ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin`` installed by; ``llvm-jitlink`` when it sees the ``-harness`` option). With these modifications in place we can selectively test functions in an object; file by mocking those function's callees. For example, suppose we have an object; file, ``test_code.o``, compiled from the following C source (which we need not; have access to):. .. code-block:: c. void irrelevant_function() { irrelevant_external(); }. int function_to_mock(int X) {; return /* some function of X */;; }. static void function_to_test() {; ...; int Y = function_to_mock();; printf(""Y is %i\n"", Y);; }.

Testability," key adaptation. Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``.

Testability," language with; LLVM <index.html>`_"" tutorial. In chapters 1 through 6, we've built a; very respectable, albeit simple, `functional programming; language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>`_. In our; journey, we learned some parsing techniques, how to build and represent; an AST, how to build LLVM IR, and how to optimize the resultant code as; well as JIT compile it. While Kaleidoscope is interesting as a functional language, the fact; that it is functional makes it ""too easy"" to generate LLVM IR for it. In; particular, a functional language makes it very easy to build LLVM IR; directly in `SSA; form <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_.; Since LLVM requires that the input code be in SSA form, this is a very; nice property and it is often unclear to newcomers how to generate code; for an imperative language with mutable variables. The short (and happy) summary of this chapter is that there is no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i3",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:1322,test,tested,1322,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability," legitimate-seeming; return types and call everything else an error. This serves the secondary; purpose of encouraging programmers not to accidentally give methods names; in the ``init`` family. Note that a method with an ``init``-family selector which returns a; non-Objective-C type (e.g. ``void``) is perfectly well-formed; it simply; isn't in the ``init`` family. A program is ill-formed if a method's declarations, implementations, and; overrides do not all have the same method family. .. _arc.family.attribute:. Explicit method family control; ------------------------------. A method may be annotated with the ``objc_method_family`` attribute to; precisely control which method family it belongs to. If a method in an; ``@implementation`` does not have this attribute, but there is a method; declared in the corresponding ``@interface`` that does, then the attribute is; copied to the declaration in the ``@implementation``. The attribute is; available outside of ARC, and may be tested for with the preprocessor query; ``__has_attribute(objc_method_family)``. The attribute is spelled; ``__attribute__((objc_method_family(`` *family* ``)))``. If *family* is; ``none``, the method has no family, even if it would otherwise be considered to; have one based on its selector and type. Otherwise, *family* must be one of; ``alloc``, ``copy``, ``init``, ``mutableCopy``, or ``new``, in which case the; method is considered to belong to the corresponding family regardless of its; selector.

The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself. The ``-oop-executor`` and ``-oop-executor-connect`` options are helpful for testing; handling of cross-process and cross-architecture use cases. Roadmap; =======. JITLink is under active development. Work so far has focused on the MachO; implementation. In LLVM 12 there is limited support for ELF on x86-64. Major outstanding projects include:. * Refactor architecture support to maximize sharing across formats. All formats should be able to share the bulk of the architecture specific; code (especially relocations) for each supported architecture. * Refactor ELF link graph construction. ELF's link graph construction is currently implemented in the `ELF_x86_64.cpp`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:43935,log,logs,43935,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['log'],['logs']
Testability," line or in; the embedded LLVM IR module. Simplifying MIR files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The MIR code coming out of ``-stop-after``/``-stop-before`` is very verbose;; Tests are more accessible and future proof when simplified:. - Use the ``-simplify-mir`` option with llc. - Machine function attributes often have default values or the test works just; as well with default values. Typical candidates for this are: `alignment:`,; `exposesReturnsTwice`, `legalized`, `regBankSelected`, `selected`.; The whole `frameInfo` section is often unnecessary if there is no special; frame usage in the function. `tracksRegLiveness` on the other hand is often; necessary for some passes that care about block livein lists. - The (global) `liveins:` list is typically only interesting for early; instruction selection passes and can be removed when testing later passes.; The per-block `liveins:` on the other hand are necessary if; `tracksRegLiveness` is true. - Branch probability data in block `successors:` lists can be dropped if the; test doesn't depend on it. Example:; `successors: %bb.1(0x40000000), %bb.2(0x40000000)` can be replaced with; `successors: %bb.1, %bb.2`. - MIR code contains a whole IR module. This is necessary because there are; no equivalents in MIR for global variables, references to external functions,; function attributes, metadata, debug info. Instead some MIR data references; the IR constructs. You can often remove them if the test doesn't depend on; them. - Alias Analysis is performed on IR values. These are referenced by memory; operands in MIR. Example: `:: (load 8 from %ir.foobar, !alias.scope !9)`.; If the test doesn't depend on (good) alias analysis the references can be; dropped: `:: (load 8)`. - MIR blocks can reference IR blocks for debug printing, profile information; or debug locations. Example: `bb.42.myblock` in MIR references the IR block; `myblock`. It is usually possible to drop the `.myblock` reference and simply; use `bb.42`. - If there are no memory ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:3949,test,test,3949,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Finding a reviewer; ------------------. Changes can be reviewed by anyone in the LLVM community who has commit; access.For larger and more complicated changes, it's important that the; reviewer has experience with the area of LLVM and knows the design goals; well. The author of a change will often assign a specific reviewer (git; blame and git log can be useful to find one).

Deprecation of the formats will be; announced and discussed on the developers mailing list. Trace Analysis Tools; --------------------. We currently have the beginnings of a trace analysis tool in LLVM, which can be; found in the ``tools/llvm-xray`` directory. The ``llvm-xray`` tool currently; supports the following subcommands:. - ``extract``: Extract the instrumentation map from a binary, and return it as; YAML.; - ``account``: Performs basic function call accounting statistics with various; options for sorting, and output formats (supports CSV, YAML, and; console-friendly TEXT).; - ``convert``: Converts an XRay log file from one format to another. We can; convert from binary XRay traces (both basic and FDR mode) to YAML,; `flame-graph <https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph>`_ friendly text; formats, as well as `Chrome Trace Viewer (catapult); <https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult>` formats.; - ``graph``: Generates a DOT graph of the function call relationships between; functions found in an XRay trace.; - ``stack``: Reconstructs function call stacks from a timeline of function; calls in an XRay trace. These subcommands use various library components found as part of the XRay; libraries, distributed with the LLVM distribution. These are:. - ``llvm/XRay/Trace.h`` : A trace reading library for conveniently loading; an XRay trace of supported forms, into a convenient in-memory representation.; All the analysis tools that deal with traces use this implementation.; - ``llvm/XRay/Graph.h`` : A semi-generic graph type used by the graph; subcommand to conveniently represent a function call",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst:11634,log,log,11634,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,1,['log'],['log']

Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important. However, if community input is not reached before the; release is out, all bugs reported will have to go on the next stable release. The official release managers are:. * Even releases: Tom Stellard (tstellar@redhat.com); * Odd releases: Tobias Hieta (tobias@hieta.se). The official release testers are volunteered from the community and have; consistently validated and released binaries for their targets/OSs. To contact; them, you should post on the `Discourse forums (Project; Infrastructure - Release Testers). <https://discourse.llvm.org/c/infrastructure/release-testers/66>`_. The official testers list is in the file ``RELEASE_TESTERS.TXT``, in the ``LLVM``; repository. Community Testing; -----------------. Once all testing has been completed and appropriate bugs filed, the release; candidate tarballs are put on the website and the LLVM community is notified. We ask that all LLVM developers test the release in any the following ways:. #. Download ``llvm-X.Y``, ``llvm-test-X.Y``, and the appropriate ``clang``; binary. Build LLVM.

Testability," major new extension, it is a good; idea to get consensus with the development community before you start working on; it. Once the design of the new feature is finalized, the work itself should be done; as a series of `incremental changes`_, not as a long-term development branch. .. _incremental changes:. Incremental Development; -----------------------. In the LLVM project, we do all significant changes as a series of incremental; patches. We have a strong dislike for huge changes or long-term development; branches. Long-term development branches have a number of drawbacks:. #. Branches must have mainline merged into them periodically. If the branch; development and mainline development occur in the same pieces of code,; resolving merge conflicts can take a lot of time. #. Other people in the community tend to ignore work on branches. #. Huge changes (produced when a branch is merged back onto mainline) are; extremely difficult to `code review`_. #. Branches are not routinely tested by our nightly tester infrastructure. #. Changes developed as monolithic large changes often don't work until the; entire set of changes is done. Breaking it down into a set of smaller; changes increases the odds that any of the work will be committed to the main; repository. To address these problems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we; require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive; change. Some tips:. * Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are; required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc). These; sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,; independently of that work. * The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of; changes if possible. Once this is done, define the first increment and get; consensus on what the end goal of the change is. * Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a; planned series of",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:27665,test,tested,27665,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,2,['test'],"['tested', 'tester']"

To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:7650,test,tests,7650,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,['test'],['tests']
Testability," management is handled by volumes. These build; additional optimization structures upon geometry closure. In order to; have navigation features properly working one has to follow some rules; for building a valid geometry. - The daughter volume(s) must not extrude the mother shape. They are; allowed however to have a common boundaries.; - The volumes positioned in the same container must not overlap with; each other. They may touch on one boundaries or shape vertex. The daughter nodes of a volume can be also removed or replaced with; other nodes:. ``` {.cpp}; void RemoveNode(TGeoNode* node); TGeoNode*ReplaceNode(TGeoNode* nodeorig, TGeoShape* newshape = 0,; TGeoMatrix* newpos = 0, TGeoMedium* newmed = 0); ```. The last method allows replacing an existing daughter of a volume with; another one. Providing only the node to be replaced will just create a; new volume for the node but having exactly the same parameters as the; old one. This helps in case of divisions for decoupling a node from the; logical hierarchy so getting new content/properties. For non-divided; volumes, one can change the shape and/or the position of the daughter. #### Virtual Containers and Assemblies of Volumes. Virtual containers are volumes that do not represent real objects, but; they are needed for grouping and positioning together other volumes.; Such grouping helps not only geometry creation, but also optimizes; tracking performance; therefore, it is highly recommended. Virtual; volumes need to inherit material/medium properties from the volume they; are placed into in order to be ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`. What we need to do is to create a virtual container volume `C`; holding `A` and `B`, then position `C` in the other volumes. Note that `C` is a volume having a determined medium. Since it is not a; real volume, we need to manually set its m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:69459,log,logical,69459,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['log'],['logical']

This verifies that the *next* time ""``Value:``"" appears in the output, it has; the value ``1``. Note: a ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" cannot be the first directive in a file. The ""CHECK-EMPTY:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you need to check that the next line has nothing on it, not even whitespace,; you can use the ""``CHECK-EMPTY:``"" directive. .. code-block:: llvm. declare void @foo(). declare void @bar(); ; CHECK: foo; ; CHECK-EMPTY:; ; CHECK-NEXT: bar. Just like ""``CHECK-NEXT:``"" the directive will fail if there is more than one; newline before it finds the next blank line, and it cannot be the first; directive in a file. The ""CHECK-NOT:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ""``CHECK-NOT:``"" directive is used to verify that a string doesn't occur; between two matches (or before the first match, or after the last match). For; example, to verify that a load is removed by a transformation, a test like this; can be used:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @coerce_offset0(i32 %V, i32* %P) {; store i32 %V, i32* %P. %P2 = bitcast i32* %P to i8*; %P3 = getelementptr i8* %P2, i32 2. %A = load i8* %P3; ret i8 %A; ; CHECK: @coerce_offset0; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ; CHECK: ret i8; }. The ""CHECK-COUNT:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you need to match multiple lines with the same pattern over and over again; you can repeat a plain ``CHECK:`` as many times as needed. If that looks too; boring you can instead use a counted check ""``CHECK-COUNT-<num>:``"", where; ``<num>`` is a positive decimal number. It will match the pattern exactly; ``<num>`` times, no more and no less.

When using the web-based code-review; tool, such notes can be provided in the ""Diff"" description (which is different; from the description of the ""Differential Revision"" as a whole used for the; commit message). If you suggest changes in a code review, but don't wish the suggestion to be; interpreted this strongly, please state so explicitly. Aim to Make Efficient Use of Everyone's Time; --------------------------------------------. Aim to limit the number of iterations in the review process. For example, when; suggesting a change, if you want the author to make a similar set of changes at; other places in the code, please explain the requested set of changes so that; the author can make all of the changes at once. If a patch will require; multiple steps prior to approval (e.g., splitting, refactoring, posting data; from specific performance tests), please explain as many of these up front as; possible.

A patch is approved to be committed when a reviewer accepts it, and this is; almost always associated with a message containing the text ""LGTM"" (which; stands for Looks Good To Me).

When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the; responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the discussion and; feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been addressed and; that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with the patch being; approved.

Say that ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` derive; from ``Square``, and so ``ShapeKind`` becomes:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; + SK_SpecialSquare,; + SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; SK_Circle; }. Then in ``Square``, we would need to modify the ``classof`` like so:. .. code-block:: c++. - static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; - return S->getKind() == SK_Square;; - }; + static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; + return S->getKind() >= SK_Square &&; + S->getKind() <= SK_OtherSpecialSquare;; + }. The reason that we need to test a range like this instead of just equality; is that both ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` ""is-a""; ``Square``, and so ``classof`` needs to return ``true`` for them. This approach can be made to scale to arbitrarily deep hierarchies. The; trick is that you arrange the enum values so that they correspond to a; preorder traversal of the class hierarchy tree. With that arrangement, all; subclass tests can be done with two comparisons as shown above. If you just; list the class hierarchy like a list of bullet points, you'll get the; ordering right::. | Shape; | Square; | SpecialSquare; | OtherSpecialSquare; | Circle. A Bug to be Aware Of; --------------------. The example just given opens the door to bugs where the ``classof``\s are; not updated to match the ``Kind`` enum when adding (or removing) classes to; (from) the hierarchy. Continuing the example above, suppose we add a ``SomewhatSpecialSquare`` as; a subclass of ``Square``, and update the ``ShapeKind`` enum like so:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; SK_SpecialSquare,; SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; + SK_SomewhatSpecialSquare,; SK_Circle; }. Now, suppose that we forget to update ``Square::classof()``, so it still; looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; // BUG: Returns false when S->getKind() == SK_SomewhatSpecialSquare,; // even though SomewhatSpecialSquare ""is a"" Square.; return S->g",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:8690,test,tests,8690,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

An example of a type identifier is ``sancov``, for dumps from LLVM; `SanitizerCoverage <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html>`_. Example::. {{{dumpfile:sancov:sancov.8675}}}. Contextual elements; ===================. These are elements that supply information necessary to convert presentation; elements to symbolic form. Unlike presentation elements, they are not directly; related to the surrounding text. Contextual elements should appear alone on; lines with no other non-whitespace text, so that the symbolizing filter might; elide the whole line from its output without hiding any other log text. The contextual elements themselves do not necessarily need to be presented in; human-readable output. However, the information they impart may be essential to; understanding the logging text even after symbolization. So it's recommended; that this information be preserved in some form when the original raw log with; markup may no longer be readily accessible for whatever reason. Contextual elements should appear in the logging stream before they are needed.; That is, if some piece of context may affect how the symbolizing filter would; interpret or present a later presentation element, the necessary contextual; elements should have appeared somewhere earlier in the logging stream. It should; always be possible for the symbolizing filter to be implemented as a single pass; over the raw logging stream, accumulating context and massaging text as it goes. ``{{{reset}}}``. This should be output before any other contextual element. The need for this; contextual element is to support implementations that handle logs coming from; multiple processes. Such implementations might not know when a new process; starts or ends. Because some identifying information (like process IDs) might; be the same between old and new processes, a way is needed to distinguish two; processes with such identic",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:17680,log,log,17680,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['log'],['log']

TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected to populate. The following variables are also; available on the *config* object, some of which must be set by the config and; others are optional or predefined:. **name** *[required]* The name of the test suite, for use in reports and; diagnostics. **test_format** *[required]* The test format object which will be used to; discover and run tests in the test suite. Generally this will be a builtin test; format available from the *lit.formats* module. **test_source_root** T",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:14789,test,test,14789,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," of itself, whether directly or via other; substitutions, should be avoided. It usually produces an infinitely recursive; definition that cannot be fully expanded. It does *not* define the; substitution in terms of its previous value, even when using ``REDEFINE:``. The relationship between the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directive is; analogous to the relationship between a variable declaration and variable; assignment in many programming languages:. - ``DEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to a new substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there is already a; substitution whose pattern contains ``%{name}`` because that could produce; confusing expansions (e.g., a lit configuration file might define a; substitution with the pattern ``%{name}\[0\]``). The new substitution is; inserted at the start of the substitution list so that it will expand first.; Thus, its value can contain any substitution previously defined, whether in; the same test file or in a lit configuration file, and both will expand. - ``REDEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to an existing substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there are no substitutions; with that pattern or if there are multiple substitutions whose patterns; contain ``%{name}``. The substitution's current position in the substitution; list does not change so that expansion order relative to other existing; substitutions is preserved. The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons.

Testability," of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**. The representation used by the; `cl::bits`_ class is an ``unsigned`` integer. An enum value is represented by a; 0/1 in the enum's ordinal value bit position. 1 indicating that the enum was; specified, 0 otherwise. As each specified value is parsed, the resulting enum's; bit is set in the option's bit vector:. .. code-block:: c++. bits |= 1 << (unsigned)enum;. Options that are specified multiple times are redundant. Any instances after; the first are discarded. Reworking the above list example, we could replace `cl::list`_ with `cl::bits`_:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::bits<Opts> OptimizationBits(cl::desc(""Available Optimizations:""),; cl::values(; clEnumVal(dce , ""Dead Code Elimination""),; clEnumVal(instsimplify , ""Instruction Simplification""),; clEnumValN(inlining, ""inline"", ""Procedure Integration""),; clEnumVal(strip , ""Strip Symbols"")));. To test to see if ``instsimplify`` was specified, we can use the ``cl:bits::isSet``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. if (OptimizationBits.isSet(instsimplify)) {; ...; }. It's also possible to get the raw bit vector using the ``cl::bits::getBits``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned bits = OptimizationBits.getBits();. Finally, if external storage is used, then the location specified must be of; **type** ``unsigned``.

Testability," only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories.

Testability," order* will not see ``getc`` defined as a macro. Module Map Language; ===================. .. warning::. The module map language is not currently guaranteed to be stable between major revisions of Clang. The module map language describes the mapping from header files to the; logical structure of modules. To enable support for using a library as; a module, one must write a ``module.modulemap`` file for that library. The; ``module.modulemap`` file is placed alongside the header files themselves,; and is written in the module map language described below. .. note::; For compatibility with previous releases, if a module map file named; ``module.modulemap`` is not found, Clang will also search for a file named; ``module.map``. This behavior is deprecated and we plan to eventually; remove it. As an example, the module map file for the C standard library might look a bit like this:. .. parsed-literal::. module std [system] [extern_c] {; module assert {; textual header ""assert.h""; header ""bits/assert-decls.h""; export *; }. module complex {; header ""complex.h""; export *; }. module ctype {; header ""ctype.h""; export *; }. module errno {; header ""errno.h""; header ""sys/errno.h""; export *; }. module fenv {; header ""fenv.h""; export *; }. // ...more headers follow...; }. Here, the top-level module ``std`` encompasses the whole C standard library. It has a number of submodules containing different parts of the standard library: ``complex`` for complex numbers, ``ctype`` for character types, etc. Each submodule lists one of more headers that provide the contents for that submodule. Finally, the ``export *`` command specifies that anything included by that submodule will be automatically re-exported. Lexical structure; -----------------; Module map files use a simplified form of the C99 lexer, with the same rules for identifiers, tokens, string literals, ``/* */`` and ``//`` comments.

We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. #. `Download <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_ and install; CMake. Version 3.20.0 is the minimum required. #. Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell; through the PATH environment variable. #. Create a build directory. Building LLVM in the source; directory is not supported. cd to this directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir mybuilddir; $ cd mybuilddir. #. Execute this command in the shell replacing `path/to/llvm/source/root` with; the path to the root of your LLVM source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake path/to/llvm/source/root. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of tests, and; generate the files required for building LLVM. CMake will use default values; for all build parameters. See the `Options and variables`_ section for; a list of build parameters that you can modify. This can fail if CMake can't detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the; environment is not sane enough. In this case, make sure that the toolset that; you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell, and that the shell; itself is the correct one for your development environment. CMake will refuse; to build MinGW makefiles if you have a POSIX shell reachable through the PATH; environment variable, for instance. You can force CMake to use a given build; tool; for instructions, see the `Usage`_ section, below.

This may cause; binary compatibility issues on older x86_64 targets, however, so use it with; caution. .. _configuration-files:. Configuration files; -------------------. Configuration files group command-line options and allow all of them to be; specified just by referencing the configuration file. They may be used, for; example, to collect options required to tune compilation for particular; target, such as ``-L``, ``-I``, ``-l``, ``--sysroot``, codegen options, etc. Configuration files can be either specified on the command line or loaded; from default locations. If both variants are present, the default configuration; files are loaded first. The command line option ``--config=`` can be used to specify explicit; configuration files in a Clang invocation. If the option is used multiple times,; all specified files are loaded, in order. For example:. ::. clang --config=/home/user/cfgs/testing.txt; clang --config=debug.cfg --config=runtimes.cfg. If the provided argument contains a directory separator, it is considered as; a file path, and options are read from that file. Otherwise the argument is; treated as a file name and is searched for sequentially in the directories:. - user directory,; - system directory,; - the directory where Clang executable resides. Both user and system directories for configuration files are specified during; clang build using CMake parameters, ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_USER_DIR`` and; ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_DIR`` respectively. The first file found is used.; It is an error if the required file cannot be found. The default configuration files are searched for in the same directories; following the rules described in the next paragraphs.

Testability," places; in the IR. If the MDNode contains multiple constants, the code generator; will use the one that corresponds to the line of the asm that the error; occurs on. .. _metadata:. Metadata; ========. LLVM IR allows metadata to be attached to instructions and global objects in the; program that can convey extra information about the code to the optimizers and; code generator. One example application of metadata is source-level; debug information. There are two metadata primitives: strings and nodes. Metadata does not have a type, and is not a value. If referenced from a; ``call`` instruction, it uses the ``metadata`` type. All metadata are identified in syntax by an exclamation point ('``!``'). .. _metadata-string:. Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings; -----------------------------------. A metadata string is a string surrounded by double quotes. It can; contain any character by escaping non-printable characters with; ""``\xx``"" where ""``xx``"" is the two digit hex code. For example:; ""``!""test\00""``"". Metadata nodes are represented with notation similar to structure; constants (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by braces and; preceded by an exclamation point). Metadata nodes can have any values as; their operand. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !{ !""test\00"", i32 10}. Metadata nodes that aren't uniqued use the ``distinct`` keyword. For example:. .. code-block:: text. !0 = distinct !{!""test\00"", i32 10}. ``distinct`` nodes are useful when nodes shouldn't be merged based on their; content. They can also occur when transformations cause uniquing collisions; when metadata operands change. A :ref:`named metadata <namedmetadatastructure>` is a collection of; metadata nodes, which can be looked up in the module symbol table. For; example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !foo = !{!4, !3}. Metadata can be used as function arguments.

Testability," probably have no reason to flush the output stream, so; it's better to use a literal ``'\n'``. Don't use ``inline`` when defining a function in a class definition; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A member function defined in a class definition is implicitly inline, so don't; put the ``inline`` keyword in this case. Don't:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:; inline void bar() {; // ...; }; };. Do:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:; void bar() {; // ...; }; };. Microscopic Details; -------------------. This section describes preferred low-level formatting guidelines along with; reasoning on why we prefer them. Spaces Before Parentheses; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Put a space before an open parenthesis only in control flow statements, but not; in normal function call expressions and function-like macros. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. if (X) ...; for (I = 0; I != 100; ++I) ...; while (LLVMRocks) ... somefunc(42);; assert(3 != 4 && ""laws of math are failing me"");. A = foo(42, 92) + bar(X);. The reason for doing this is not completely arbitrary. This style makes control; flow operators stand out more, and makes expressions flow better. Prefer Preincrement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal. But for iterators, it can be a huge; issue (for example, some iterators contains stack and set objects in them...; copying an iterator could invoke the copy ctor's of these as well). In general,; get in the habit of always using preincrement, and you won't have a problem. Namespace Indentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, we strive to reduce indentation wherever possible.

Testability," prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details. There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability.

Testability," project, which also compiles executables; requiring their own ``main`` symbol, it may be desirable to request just the; instrumentation without linking::. clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c. Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in; ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` during the linking stage. .. _libfuzzer-corpus:. Corpus; ------. Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files. The fuzzer generates random mutations based around the sample inputs in; the current corpus. If a mutation triggers execution of a previously-uncovered; path in the code under test, then that mutation is saved to the corpus for; future variations. LibFuzzer will work without any initial seeds, but will be less; efficient if the library under test accepts complex,; structured inputs. The corpus can also act as a sanity/regression check, to confirm that the; fuzzing entrypoint still works and that all of the sample inputs run through; the code under test without problems. If you have a large corpus (either generated by fuzzing or acquired by other means); you may want to minimize it while still preserving the full coverage. One way to do that; is to use the `-merge=1` flag:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir NEW_CORPUS_DIR # Store minimized corpus here.; ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 NEW_CORPUS_DIR FULL_CORPUS_DIR. You may use the same flag to add more interesting items to an existing corpus.; Only the inputs that trigger new coverage will be added to the first corpus. .. code-block:: console. ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 CURRENT_CORPUS_DIR NEW_POTENTIALLY_INTERESTING_INPUTS_DIR.

Testability," ptr %p2; }. Migration Instructions; ======================. In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type. Here are some common ways to avoid pointer element type accesses:. * For loads, use ``getType()``.; * For stores, use ``getValueOperand()->getType()``.; * Use ``getLoadStoreType()`` to handle both of the above in one call.; * For getelementptr instructions, use ``getSourceElementType()``.; * For calls, use ``getFunctionType()``.; * For allocas, use ``getAllocatedType()``.; * For globals, use ``getValueType()``.; * For consistency assertions, use; ``PointerType::isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()``.; * To create a pointer type in a different address space, use; ``PointerType::getWithSamePointeeType()``.; * To check that two pointers have the same element type, use; ``PointerType::hasSameElementTypeAs()``.; * While it is preferred to write code in a way that accepts both typed and; opaque pointers, ``Type::isOpaquePointerTy()`` and; ``PointerType::isOpaque()`` can be used to handle opaque pointers specially.; ``PointerType::getNonOpaquePointerElementType()`` can be used as a marker in; code-paths where opaque pointers have been explicitly excluded.; * To get the type of a byval argument, use ``getParamByValType()``. Similar; method exists for other ABI-affecting attributes that need to know the; element type, such as byref, sret, inalloca and preallocated.; * Some intrinsics require an ``elementtype`` attribute, which can be retrieved; using ``getParamElementType()``. This attribute is required in cases where; the intrinsic does not natura",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:7187,assert,assertions,7187,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['assert'],['assertions']
Testability," quicker attention.; Please ping people :wave: should you not get timely feedback, for instance with `@root-project/core ping!`. ## Tests. As you contribute code, this code will likely fix an issue or add a feature.; Whatever it is: this requires you to add a new test, or to extend an existing test. Depending on the size and complexity; of this test, it exists either in the `test/` subdirectory of each part of ROOT (see for instance; [`tree/dataframe/test`](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/tree/dataframe/test)), or in; [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git). Tests in `test/` subdirectories are unit tests, mostly based on; [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and easily extended. Tests in; [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git) are more involved (e.g., tests requiring custom dictionaries or; data files). When you create a branch in the main ROOT repository (i.e., this repository) and add a test to `roottest`,; make sure to do this under the same branch name (and open a PR for it). Our CI infrastructure automatically picks up the; changes defined in the `roottest` PR based on this branch name, and uses that for testing your PR here. ## Continuous Integration. To prevent bad surprises and make a better first impression, we; strongly encourage new developers to [run the tests](https://root.cern/for_developers/run_the_tests/); _before_ submitting a pull request.

Testability," quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not send or commit patches that use it.]*. Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on.

Testability," represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers.

The logical view includes the following **logical elements**: *type*,; *scope*, *symbol* and *line*, which are the basic software elements used; in the C/C++ programming language. Each logical element has a set of; **attributes**, such as *types*, *classes*, *functions*, *variables*,; *parameters*, etc. The :option:`--attribute` can be used to specify which; attributes to include when printing a logical element.

Testability," represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol.

Testability," resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations. Eliminating these restrictions and limitations was one of the primary motivations; for the development of JITLink. The llvm-jitlink tool; =====================. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is a command line wrapper for the JITLink library.; It loads some set of relocatable object files and then links them using; JITLink. Depending on the options used it will then execute them, or validate; the linked memory. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool was originally designed to aid JITLink development by; providing a simple environment for testing. Basic usage; -----------. By default, ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the set of objects passed on the command; line, then search for a ""main"" function and execute it:. .. code-block:: sh. % cat hello-world.c; #include <stdio.h>. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; printf(""hello, world!\n"");; return 0;; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:36658,stub,stub,36658,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['stub'],['stub']

Note how the `evaluate()` function overrides the `RooAbsReal` for the RooFoo; class. Similarly, the `analyticalIntegral()` function has also been overridden; from the `RooAbsReal` class. The `evaluate()` function includes some bookkeeping steps (commented out in; above example) that are not relevant to AD. The important part is that it; calls a specific function (doFoo() in this example), and returns the results. Similarly, the `analyticalIntegral()` function calls a specific function (; `integralFoo()` in this example), and returns the results. It may also include; some code that may need to be looked at, but for simplicity, its contents are; commented out in this example. #### Adding Code Generation Support to RooFoo class. Before creating the translate() function, move the mathematical logic (; `doFoo()` function in this example) out of the source class (RooFoo in this; example) and into a separate header file called `MathFuncs.h`.

So now that the `doFoo()` function exists in the `MathFuncs` namespace, we; need to comment out its original function definition in the RooFoo class and; also add the namespace `MathFuncs` to wherever `doFoo()` it is referenced; (and also define input parameters for it). ``` {.cpp}; class RooFoo : public RooAbsReal {; ...; // int doFoo() { return a* b + a + b; }. double evaluate() override {; ...; return MathFuncs::doFoo(a, b);; };; ```.

At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general. If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the; ""libcalls"" test as an example. It can be run like this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=libcalls report.

We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object. To build this file and tree follow the instructions on how to; build the examples in `$ROOTSYS/test`. Execute `Event` and instruct it; to split the object with this command (from the UNIX command line). ``` {.cpp}; > $ROOTSYS/test/Event 400 1 2 1; ```. This creates an `Event.root` file with 400 events, compressed, split,; and filled. See `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx` for more info. The person who designed the tree makes a shared library available to; you, which defines the classes needed. In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`.

Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify.

Testability," specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``.

Special Case File; -----------------. Attributes can be imbued through the use of special case files instead of; adding them to the original source files. You can use this to mark certain; functions and classes to be never, always, or instrumented with first-argument; logging from a file.

To reduce the very large number of new and delete calls in large loops; like this (O(100000) x O(10000) times new/delete):. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray a(10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); a[i] = new TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Delete();; }; ```. You better use a **`TClonesArray`** which reduces the number of; new/delete calls to only O(10000):. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray a(""TTrack"", 10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); TTrack *track = (Track*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Clear(); // Or Clear(""C"") if the track objects must be returned (via Track::Clear) to a default state.; }; ```. Considering that a pair of new/delete calls on average cost about 70 ms,; O(109) new/deletes will save about 19 hours. For the other collections,; see the class reference guide on the web and the test program; `$ROOTSYS/test/tcollex.cxx.`. ## Template Containers and STL. Some people dislike polymorphic containers because they are not truly; ""type safe"". In the end, the compiler leaves it the user to ensure that; the types are correct. This only leaves the other alternative: creating; a new class each time a new (container organization) / (contained; object) combination is needed. To say the least this could be very; tedious. Most people faced with this choice would, for each type of; container:. Define the class leaving a dummy name for the contained object type.; When a particular container was needed, copy the code and then do a; global search and replace for the contained class. C++ has a built in; template scheme that effectively does just this. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; template<class T>; class ArrayContainer {; private:; T *member[10];; ...; };; ```. This is an array container with a 10-element array of pointers to T, it; could hold up to 10 T objects.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:17897,test,test,17897,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,2,['test'],['test']

This uses the BareMetal driver in clang and by default won't find the libraries needed to pass the cmake compiler check. As the Armv6-M, Armv7-M and Armv7E-M builds of compiler-rt only use instructions; that are supported on Armv7-A we can still get most of the value of running the; tests using the same ``qemu-arm`` that we used for Armv7-A by building and; running the test cases for Armv7-A but using the builtins compiled for; Armv6-M, Armv7-M or Armv7E-M.

Examples:. - The target code uses a PRNG seeded e.g. by system time and; thus two consequent invocations may potentially execute different code paths; even if the end result will be the same. This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled. We propose to use a common build macro; for all such cases for consistency: ``FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION``. .. code-block:: c++. void MyInitPRNG() {; #ifdef FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION; // In fuzzing mode the behavior of the code should be deterministic.; srand(0);; #else; srand(time(0));; #endif; }.

Testability," the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

A separate index maps these numeric selector values to the offset of the; selector within the on-disk hash table, and will be used when de-serializing an; Objective-C method declaration (or other Objective-C construct) that refers to; the selector. AST Reader Integration Points; -----------------------------. The ""lazy"" deserialization behavior of AST files requires their integration; into several completely different submodules of Clang. For example, lazily; deserializing the declarations during name lookup requires that the name-lookup; routines be able to query the AST file to find entities stored there. For each Clang data structure that requires direct interaction with the AST; reader logic, there is an abstract class that provides the interface between; the two modules. The ``ASTReader`` class, which handles the loading of an AST; file, inherits from all of these abstract classes to provide lazy; deserialization of Clang's data structures. ``ASTReader`` implements the; following abstract classes:. ``ExternalSLocEntrySource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``SourceManager`` class, and; is used whenever the :ref:`source manager <pchinternals-sourcemgr>` needs to; load the details of a file, buffer, or macro instantiation. ``IdentifierInfoLookup``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``IdentifierTable`` class, and; is used whenever the program source refers to an identifier that has not yet; been seen. In this case, the AST reader searches for this identifier within; its :ref:`identifier table <pchinternals-ident-table>` to load any top-level; declarations or macros associated with that identifier. ``ExternalASTSource``; This abstract interf",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:21890,log,logic,21890,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability," the actual documentation itself.; Additionally, it can specify a custom heading for the attribute, though a; default heading will be chosen when possible. There are four predefined documentation categories: ``DocCatFunction`` for; attributes that appertain to function-like subjects, ``DocCatVariable`` for; attributes that appertain to variable-like subjects, ``DocCatType`` for type; attributes, and ``DocCatStmt`` for statement attributes. A custom documentation; category should be used for groups of attributes with similar functionality.; Custom categories are good for providing overview information for the attributes; grouped under it. For instance, the consumed annotation attributes define a; custom category, ``DocCatConsumed``, that explains what consumed annotations are; at a high level. Documentation content (whether it is for an attribute or a category) is written; using reStructuredText (RST) syntax. After writing the documentation for the attribute, it should be locally tested; to ensure that there are no issues generating the documentation on the server.; Local testing requires a fresh build of clang-tblgen. To generate the attribute; documentation, execute the following command::. clang-tblgen -gen-attr-docs -I /path/to/clang/include /path/to/clang/include/clang/Basic/Attr.td -o /path/to/clang/docs/AttributeReference.rst. When testing locally, *do not* commit changes to ``AttributeReference.rst``.; This file is generated by the server automatically, and any changes made to this; file will be overwritten. Arguments; ~~~~~~~~~; Attributes may optionally specify a list of arguments that can be passed to the; attribute. Attribute arguments specify both the parsed form and the semantic; form of the attribute. For example, if ``Args`` is; ``[StringArgument<""Arg1"">, IntArgument<""Arg2"">]`` then; ``__attribute__((myattribute(""Hello"", 3)))`` will be a valid use; it requires; two arguments while parsing, and the Attr subclass' constructor for the; semantic attribute ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:136015,test,tested,136015,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability," the fact that symbol names in the; LLVM symbol table are allowed to have any character in them, including; embedded nul characters. The next interesting thing to add, is codegen support for these binary; operators. Given our current structure, this is a simple addition of a; default case for our existing binary operator node:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *BinaryExprAST::codegen() {; Value *L = LHS->codegen();; Value *R = RHS->codegen();; if (!L || !R); return nullptr;. switch (Op) {; case '+':; return Builder->CreateFAdd(L, R, ""addtmp"");; case '-':; return Builder->CreateFSub(L, R, ""subtmp"");; case '*':; return Builder->CreateFMul(L, R, ""multmp"");; case '<':; L = Builder->CreateFCmpULT(L, R, ""cmptmp"");; // Convert bool 0/1 to double 0.0 or 1.0; return Builder->CreateUIToFP(L, Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext),; ""booltmp"");; default:; break;; }. // If it wasn't a builtin binary operator, it must be a user defined one.

Since user-defined operators are just; built as normal functions (because the ""prototype"" boils down to a; function with the right name) everything falls into place.

Testability," the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2.

Testability," the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute. Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions.

Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files. The fuzzer generates random mutations based around the sample inputs in; the current corpus.

This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure. Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about; their status (generally only for failures). See the :ref:`output-options`; section for more information. .. _lit-infrastructure:. LIT INFRASTRUCTURE; ------------------.

Testability," the result of the; expression is defined to be -0.0. If we look at the uses of the fmul for example, we might be able to prove that; all uses don't care about the sign of zero. For example, if we have:. fadd(fmul(sitofp(x), 0.0), 2.0). Since we know that x+2.0 doesn't care about the sign of any zeros in X, we can; transform the fmul to 0.0, and then the fadd to 2.0. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. We should enhance memcpy/memcpy/memset to allow a metadata node on them; indicating that some bytes of the transfer are undefined. This is useful for; frontends like clang when lowering struct copies, when some elements of the; struct are undefined. Consider something like this:. struct x {; char a;; int b[4];; };; void foo(struct x*P);; struct x testfunc() {; struct x V1, V2;; foo(&V1);; V2 = V1;. return V2;; }.

Testability," the usual way: in a case like ``if v1 then if v2 then {...} else {...}``, the; ``else`` associates with the inner ``if`` rather than the outer one. The :token:`IfBody` of the then and else arms of the ``if`` establish an; inner scope. Any ``defvar`` variables defined in the bodies go out of scope; when the bodies are finished (see `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details). The ``if`` statement can also be used in a record :token:`Body`. ``assert`` --- check that a condition is true; ---------------------------------------------. The ``assert`` statement checks a boolean condition to be sure that it is true; and prints an error message if it is not. .. productionlist::; Assert: ""assert"" `condition` "","" `message` "";"". If the boolean condition is true, the statement does nothing. If the; condition is false, it prints a nonfatal error message. The **message**, which; can be an arbitrary string expression, is included in the error message as a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class. The assertions are; then checked when the records are completely built. * In a multiclass definition, the assertions are saved with the other; components of the multiclass and then checked each time the multiclass; is instantiated with ``defm``. Using assertions in TableGen files can simplify record checking in TableGen; backends. Here is an example of an ``assert`` in two class definitions. .. code-block:: text. class PersonName<string name> {; assert !le(!size(name), 32), ""person name is too long: "" # name;; string Name = name;; }. class Person<string name, int age> : PersonName<name> {; assert !and(!ge(age, 1), !le(age, 120)), ""person age is invalid:",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:49389,assert,assert,49389,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['assert'],['assert']

Testability," the; registers ``EAX``, ``AX`` and ``AL`` share the first eight bits. These physical; registers are marked as *aliased* in LLVM. Given a particular architecture, you; can check which registers are aliased by inspecting its ``RegisterInfo.td``; file. Moreover, the class ``MCRegAliasIterator`` enumerates all the physical; registers aliased to a register. Physical registers, in LLVM, are grouped in *Register Classes*. Elements in the; same register class are functionally equivalent, and can be interchangeably; used. Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }. Sometimes, mostly for debugging purposes, it is useful to change the number of; physical registers available in the target architecture. This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*. See the; definition of the ``GR8`` register class in; ``lib/Target/X86/X86RegisterInfo.td`` for an example of this. Virtual registers are also denoted by integer numbers. Contrary to physical; registers, different virtual registers never share the same number.

Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general. If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the; ""libcalls"" test as an example. It can be run like this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=libcalls",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst:5350,test,tester,5350,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,1,['test'],['tester']

Testability," throw. The term used to define the place where an ``invoke`` continues after an; exception is called a *landing pad*. LLVM landing pads are conceptually; alternative function entry points where an exception structure reference and a; type info index are passed in as arguments. The landing pad saves the exception; structure reference and then proceeds to select the catch block that corresponds; to the type info of the exception object. The LLVM :ref:`i_landingpad` is used to convey information about the landing; pad to the back end. For C++, the ``landingpad`` instruction returns a pointer; and integer pair corresponding to the pointer to the *exception structure* and; the *selector value* respectively. The ``landingpad`` instruction looks for a reference to the personality; function to be used for this ``try``/``catch`` sequence in the parent; function's attribute list. The instruction contains a list of *cleanup*,; *catch*, and *filter* clauses. The exception is tested against the clauses; sequentially from first to last. The clauses have the following meanings:. - ``catch <type> @ExcType``. - This clause means that the landingpad block should be entered if the; exception being thrown is of type ``@ExcType`` or a subtype of; ``@ExcType``. For C++, ``@ExcType`` is a pointer to the ``std::type_info``; object (an RTTI object) representing the C++ exception type. - If ``@ExcType`` is ``null``, any exception matches, so the landingpad; should always be entered. This is used for C++ catch-all blocks (""``catch; (...)``""). - When this clause is matched, the selector value will be equal to the value; returned by ""``@llvm.eh.typeid.for(i8* @ExcType)``"". This will always be a; positive value. - ``filter <type> [<type> @ExcType1, ..., <type> @ExcTypeN]``. - This clause means that the landingpad should be entered if the exception; being thrown does *not* match any of the types in the list (which, for C++,; are again specified as ``std::type_info`` pointers). - C++ front-ends u",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:8190,test,tested,8190,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability," to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed. For example:. > [roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx). > Tip: Tests like above can be referenced to see which parts of RooFit already; support AD. ### How do I control my compile time?.

Testability," to merge functions? The obvious answer is: Yes, that is quite a; possible case. We usually *do* have duplicates and it would be good to get rid; of them. But how do we detect duplicates? This is the idea: we split functions; into smaller bricks or parts and compare the ""bricks"" amount. If equal,; we compare the ""bricks"" themselves, and then do our conclusions about functions; themselves. What could the difference be? For example, on a machine with 64-bit pointers; (let's assume we have only one address space), one function stores a 64-bit; integer, while another one stores a pointer. If the target is the machine; mentioned above, and if functions are identical, except the parameter type (we; could consider it as a part of function type), then we can treat a ``uint64_t``; and a ``void*`` as equal. This is just an example; more possible details are described a bit below. As another example, the reader may imagine two more functions. The first; function performs a multiplication by 2, while the second one performs an; logical left shift by 1. Possible solutions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Let's briefly consider possible options about how and what we have to implement; in order to create full-featured functions merging, and also what it would; mean for us. Equal function detection obviously supposes that a ""detector"" method to be; implemented and latter should answer the question ""whether functions are equal"".; This ""detector"" method consists of tiny ""sub-detectors"", which each answers; exactly the same question, but for function parts. As the second step, we should merge equal functions. So it should be a ""merger""; method. ""Merger"" accepts two functions *F1* and *F2*, and produces *F1F2*; function, the result of merging. Having such routines in our hands, we can process a whole module, and merge all; equal functions. In this case, we have to compare every function with every another function. As; the reader may notice, this way seems to be quite expensive. Of course we could;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst:4431,log,logical,4431,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

Testability," to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:46363,assert,assert,46363,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['assert'],['assert']

XML files do not have any advantages; compared to the normal ROOT files, except that the information in these; files can be edited via a normal editor. The main motivation for this; new format is to facilitate the communication with other non ROOT; applications. Currently writing and reading XML files is limited to ROOT; applications. It is our intention to develop a simple reader independent; of the ROOT libraries that could be used as an example for real; applications. The XML format should be used only for small data volumes, typically; histogram files, pictures, geometries, calibrations. The XML file is; built in memory before being dumped to disk. Like for normal ROOT files,; XML files use the same I/O mechanism exploiting the ROOT/Cling; dictionary. Any class having a dictionary can be saved in XML format.; This first implementation does not support subdirectories or trees. The shared library `libRXML.so` may be loaded dynamically via; `gSystem->Load(""libRXML"")`. This library is also automatically loaded by; the plug-in manager as soon a XML file is created.

The concrete classes describing statistical tools implementing the above interfaces are:; ; ProfileLikelihoodCalculator: it is an implementation of a CombinedCalculator using the profile likelihood ratio as a test statistics. After configuring the calculator, one only needs to ask GetHypoTest() (which will return a HypoTestResult pointer) or GetInterval() (which will return an ConfInterval pointer).; LikelihoodInterval: concrete implementation of a ConfInterval interface. It implements connected N-dimensional intervals based on the contour of a likelihood ratio. The boundary of the interval is equivalent to a MINUIT/MINOS contour about the maximum likelihood estimator. . HybridCalculator: hypothesis test calculator using a Bayesian-frequentist hybrid method (often called in HEP as CLs method). This class extends the functionality of the TLimit class by taking advantage of the RooFit package. The result of the calculator is returned as an HybridResult pointer. HybridResult implements the HypoTestResult interface.

Arrays (within an entry) are printed in their linear forms. If several; arrays with multiple dimensions are printed together, they will NOT be; synchronized. For example, with a tree containing `arr1[4][2] `and; `arr2[2][3]`,. ``` {.cpp}; root[] MyTree(""arr1:arr2"");; ```. will results in a printing similar to:. ``` {.cpp}; ************************************************; * Row * Instance * arr1 * arr2 *; ***********************************************; * x * 0 * arr1[0][0]* arr2[0][0]*; * x * 1 * arr1[0][1]* arr2[0][1]*; * x * 2 * arr1[1][0]* arr2[0][2]*; * x * 3 * arr1[1][1]* arr2[1][0]*; * x * 4 * arr1[2][0]* arr2[1][1]*; * x * 5 * arr1[2][1]* arr2[1][2]*; * x * 6 * arr1[3][0]* *; * x * 7 * arr1[3][1]* *; ```.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing. But if we claim support; for a feature that has significant bugs, we've eliminated most of the utility; of having a feature testing macro at all because users are then forced to test; what compiler version is in use to get a more accurate answer. The status reported by the feature test macro should always be reflected in the; language support page for the corres",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:163532,assert,assertions,163532,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['assert'],['assertions']

Testability," use ""``CHECK:``""; and ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives to specify this. If you specified a custom; check prefix, just use ""``<PREFIX>-SAME:``"". ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is particularly powerful in conjunction with ""``CHECK-NOT:``""; (described below). For example, the following works like you'd expect:. .. code-block:: llvm. !0 = !DILocation(line: 5, scope: !1, inlinedAt: !2). ; CHECK: !DILocation(line: 5,; ; CHECK-NOT: column:; ; CHECK-SAME: scope: ![[SCOPE:[0-9]+]]. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives reject the input if there are any newlines between; it and the previous directive. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is also useful to avoid writing matchers for irrelevant; fields. For example, suppose you're writing a test which parses a tool that; generates output like this:. .. code-block:: text. Name: foo; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. Name: bar; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 2. Name: baz; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. To write a test that verifies ``foo`` has the value ``1``, you might first; write this:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value: 1{{$}}. However, this would be a bad test: if the value for ``foo`` changes, the test; would still pass because the ""``CHECK: Value: 1``"" line would match the value; from ``baz``. To fix this, you could add ``CHECK-NEXT`` matchers for every; ``FieldN:`` line, but that would be verbose, and need to be updated when; ``Field4`` is added. A more succinct way to write the test using the; ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" matcher would be as follows:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value:; CHECK-SAME: {{ 1$}}. This verifies that the *next* time ""``Value:``"" appears in the output, it has; the value ``1``. Note: a ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" cannot be the first directive in a file.

An example of the two-dimensional spectrum with the identified peaks is; shown in Figure 3.8. ![Two-dimensional spectrum with the identified peaks](figures/image072.png). We have also generalized the peak searching function similarly to one-dimensional data. The generalized peak searching function for two-dimensional spectra has the form of. ```{.cpp}; Int_t Search2General(float **source,; int sizex,; int sizey,; double sigma,; int threshold,; bool markov,; int aver_window);; ```. This function searches for peaks in the source spectrum. The number of found; peaks and their positions are written into the structure pointed by; `two_dim_peak` structure pointer. Function parameters:. - **`source`**: pointer to the vector of the source spectrum; - **`sizex`**: x length of the source spectrum; - **`sizey`**: y length of the source spectrum; - **`sigma`**: sigma of searched peaks; - **`threshold`**: threshold value for peaks selection; - **`markov`**: logical variable. If it is set to `true`, then the source spectrum is first replaced by the new spectrum calculated using Markov chains method; - **`aver_window`** averaging window of searched peaks (applies only for the Markov method). An example of experimental 2-dimensional spectrum is given in Figure 3.9.; The number of peaks identified by the function now is 295. ![Experimental 2-dimensional spectrum](figures/image074.png). The function works even for very noisy data. In Figure 3.10 we present; synthetic 2-dimensional spectrum with 5 peaks. The method should; recognize what is the real 2-dimensional peak and what is the crossing of; two 1-dimensional ridges. The Markov spectrum with averaging window=3 is; given in Figure 3.11.

The unified syntax for both checking a; numeric expression and capturing its value into a numeric variable is thus; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>: <constraint> <expr>]]`` with each element as; described previously. One can use this syntax to make a testcase more; self-describing by using variables instead of values:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG_OFFSET:]], 0x[[#%X,FIELD_OFFSET:12]]; ; CHECK-NEXT: load r[[#]], [r[[#REG_BASE:]], r[[#REG_OFFSET]]]. which would match:. .. code-block:: gas. mov r4, 0xC; load r6, [r5, r4]. The ``--enable-var-scope`` option has the same effect on numeric variables as; on string variables. Important note: In its current implementation, an expression cannot use a; numeric variable defined earlier in the same CHECK directive. FileCheck Pseudo Numeric Variables; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes there's a need to verify output that contains line numbers of the; match file, e.g. when testing compiler diagnostics. This introduces a certain; fragility of the match file structure, as ""``CHECK:``"" lines contain absolute; line numbers in the same file, which have to be updated whenever line numbers; change due to text addition or deletion. To support this case, FileCheck expressions understand the ``@LINE`` pseudo; numeric variable which evaluates to the line number of the CHECK pattern where; it is found. This way match patterns can be put near the relevant test lines and include; relative line number references, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: test.cpp:[[# @LINE + 4]]:6: error: expected ';' after top level declarator; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^int a}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ \^}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ ;}}; int a. To support legacy uses of ``@LINE`` as a special string variable,; :program:`FileCheck` also accepts the following uses of ``@LINE`` with string; substitution block syntax: ``[[@LINE]]``, ``[[@LINE+<offset>]]`` and; ``[[@LINE-<offset>]]`` without any spaces inside the bra",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:33732,test,testing,33732,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Rejecting unwanted inputs; -------------------------. It may be desirable to reject some inputs, i.e. to not add them to the corpus. For example, when fuzzing an API consisting of parsing and other logic,; one may want to allow only those inputs into the corpus that parse successfully. If the fuzz target returns -1 on a given input,; libFuzzer will not add that input top the corpus, regardless of what coverage; it triggers. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {; if (auto *Obj = ParseMe(Data, Size)) {; Obj->DoSomethingInteresting();; return 0; // Accept.

Binaries built with AddressSanitizer_ or LeakSanitizer_ will try to detect; memory leaks at the process shutdown.; For in-process fuzzing this is inconvenient; since the fuzzer needs to report a leak with a reproducer as soon as the leaky; mutation is found.

Testability," violating nullability?; In some cases, it may make sense for methods to intentionally violate; nullability. For example, your method may — for reasons of backward; compatibility — chose to return nil and log an error message in a method; with a non-null return type when the client violated a documented precondition; rather than check the precondition with NSAssert(). In these cases, you; can suppress the analyzer warning with a cast:. return (id _Nonnull)nil;. Note that this cast does not affect code generation. Q: The analyzer assumes that a loop body is never entered. How can I tell it that the loop body will be entered at least once?. In the contrived example above, the analyzer has detected that the body of; the loop is never entered for the case where length <= 0. In this; particular example, you may know that the loop will always be entered because; the input parameter length will be greater than zero in all calls to this; function. You can teach the analyzer facts about your code as well as document; it by using assertions. By adding assert(length > 0) in the beginning; of the function, you tell the analyzer that your code is never expecting a zero; or a negative value, so it won't need to test the correctness of those paths. int foo(int length) {; int x = 0;; assert(length > 0);; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++); x += 1;; return length/x;; }.

""So basically what we need to support the ""no stack frame save and restore"" is a; generalization of the LR optimization to ""callee-save regs"". Currently, we have LR marked as a callee-save reg. The register allocator sees; that it's callee save, and spills it directly to the stack. Ideally, something like this would happen:. LR would be in a separate register class from the GPRs. The class of LR would be; marked ""unspillable"". When the register allocator came across an unspillable; reg, it would ask ""what is the best class to copy this into that I *can* spill""; If it gets a class back, which it will in this case (the gprs), it grabs a free; register of that class.

Testability," we have to convert every function part into some number, and then add it; into the hash. The lookup-up time would be small, but such an approach adds some; delay due to the hashing routine.

Lookup time still depends on N,; but adds a little of delay (*log(N)*). Present state; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; Both of the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (in theory) random-access approach.

Testability," when; execution is correct rather than overwriting it. We now have a value in `%rax` in each basic block that indicates if at some; point previously a predicate was mispredicted. And we have arranged for that; value to be particularly effective when used below to harden loads. ##### Indirect Call, Branch, and Return Predicates. There is no analogous flag to use when tracing indirect calls, branches, and; returns. The predicate state must be accumulated through some other means.; Fundamentally, this is the reverse of the problem posed in CFI: we need to; check where we came from rather than where we are going. For function-local; jump tables, this is easily arranged by testing the input to the jump table; within each destination (not yet implemented, use retpolines):; ```; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; jmpq *.LJTI0_0(,%rdi,8) # Indirect jump through table.; .LBB0_2: # %sw.bb; testq $0, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_3: # %sw.bb1; testq $1, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_5: # %sw.bb10; testq $2, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL; ... .section .rodata,""a"",@progbits; .p2align 3; .LJTI0_0:; .quad .LBB0_2; .quad .LBB0_3; .quad .LBB0_5; ...; ```.

Testability," where the logs are generated and of; the host operating system and machine architecture where the filter runs. This format assumes that the symbolizing filter processes intact whole lines. If; long lines might be split during some stage of a logging pipeline, they must be; reassembled to restore the original line breaks before feeding lines into the; symbolizing filter. Most markup elements must appear entirely on a single line; (often with other text before and/or after the markup element). There are some; markup elements that are specified to span lines, with line breaks in the middle; of the element. Even in those cases, the filter is not expected to handle line; breaks in arbitrary places inside a markup element, but only inside certain; fields. This format assumes that the symbolizing filter processes a coherent stream of; log lines from a single process address space context. If a logging stream; interleaves log lines from more than one process, these must be collated into; separate per-process log streams and each stream processed by a separate; instance of the symbolizing filter. Because the kernel and user processes use; disjoint address regions in most operating systems, a single user process; address space plus the kernel address space can be treated as a single address; space for symbolization purposes if desired. Dependence on Build IDs; =======================. The symbolizer markup scheme relies on contextual information about runtime; memory address layout to make it possible to convert markup elements into useful; symbolic form. This relies on having an unmistakable identification of which; binary was loaded at each address.

TEST DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories.

Testability," will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches.; If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a; point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates; on it. A variable on a **`TBranch`** is called a leaf (yes -; **`TLeaf`**). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that; branches of the same **`TTree`** can be written to separate files. To; add a **`TBranch`** to a **`TTree`** we call the; method **`TTree::Branch()`**. Note that we DO NOT use the `TBranch`; constructor. The `TTree::Branch` method has several signatures. The branch type; differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a; list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a; **`TList`**, or an array of objects. Let's see some examples. To follow; along you will need the shared library `libEvent.so`. First, check if it; is in `$ROOTSYS/test`. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not; there, you have to build it by typing make in `$ROOTSYS/test`. ## Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables. As in the very first example (`cernstaff.root.root`); the data we want to save is a list of simple variables, such as integers; or floats. In this case, we use the following `TTree::Branch` signature:. ``` {.cpp}; tree->Branch(""Ev_Branch"",&event,; ""temp/F:ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex:flag/i"");; ```. The first parameter is the branch name. The second parameter is the address from which the first variable is to; be read. In the code above, ""event"" is a structure with one float and; three integers and one unsigned integer. You should not assume that the; compiler aligns the elements of a structure without gaps. To avoid; alignment problems, you need to use structures with same length members.; If your structure does not qualify, you need to create one branch for; each element of the structure. The leaf name is NOT used to pick the variable out of the structure, but; is only used as the name for the leaf.

It's usually easy to tell: just look for; redirection or piping of the ``FileCheck`` call's stdout or stderr. .. _Test-specific substitutions:. **Test-specific substitutions:**. Additional substitutions can be defined as follows:. - Lit configuration files (e.g., ``lit.cfg`` or ``lit.local.cfg``) can define; substitutions for all tests in a test directory. They do so by extending the; substitution list, ``config.substitutions``. Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s. Alternatively, the above substitutions can be defined in a lit configuration; file to be shared with other test files.

Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitl",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:43222,assert,asserts,43222,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['assert'],['asserts']

The **`TExec`** function/script; can do one or more of the following:**. - Load a file containing the referenced object. This function; typically looks in the file catalog. - Compute a pointer to the referenced object and communicate this; pointer back to the calling function **`TRef`**`::SetObject` via:. ``` {.cpp}; TRef::SetObject(object); ```.

Some viewers can support two types of object placement:. - Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference; frame - e.g. a sphere, radius `r`, at `x`, `y`, `z`. - Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique; piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a; sphere `S` (radius `r`), place copy at `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, another; copy at `x2`, `y2`, `z2` etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT's; **`TGeo`** package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated; placements of relatively few unique ""shapes"". Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of; this by identifying unique logical shapes from the `fID` logical ID; member of **`TBuffer3D`**. If repeated addition of the same `fID` is; found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does; not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL; specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in; these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be; described in **`TBuffer3D`** in the local reference frame, complete with; the local`/`master translation. In some cases you will not have a real; object you can reasonably set **`TBuffer3D::fID` to, or the object is; recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in; these cases, set `TBuffer3D::fID` to 0 (null).**. The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the; **`TVirtualViewer3D`** interface method: `PreferLocalFrame()`. If this; returns `kTRUE` you can make repeated calls to `AddObject()`, with; **`TBuffer3D`** containing the same `fID",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:134922,log,logical,134922,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,2,['log'],['logical']

Testability,"# Bugpoint Redesign; Author: Diego Treviño (diegotf@google.com). Date: 2019-06-05. Status: Draft. ## Introduction; As use of bugpoint has grown several areas of improvement have been identified; through years of use: confusing to use, slow, it doesn’t always produce high; quality test cases, etc. This document proposes a new approach with a narrower; focus: minimization of IR test cases. ## Proposed New Design. ### Narrow focus: test-case reduction; The main focus will be a code reduction strategy to obtain much smaller test; cases that still have the same property as the original one. This will be done; via classic delta debugging and by adding some IR-specific reductions (e.g.; replacing globals, removing unused instructions, etc), similar to what; already exists, but with more in-depth minimization. Granted, if the community differs on this proposal, the legacy code could still; be present in the tool, but with the caveat of still being documented and; designed towards delta reduction. ### Command-Line Options; We are proposing to reduce the plethora of bugpoint’s options to just two: an; interesting-ness test and the arguments for said test, similar to other delta; reduction tools such as CReduce, Delta, and Lithium; the tool should feel less; cluttered, and there should also be no uncertainty about how to operate it. The interesting-ness test that’s going to be run to reduce the code is given; by name:; `--test=<test_name>`; If a `--test` option is not given, the program exits; this option is similar; to bugpoint’s current `-compile-custom` option, which lets the user run a; custom script. The interesting-ness test would be defined as a script that returns 0 when the; IR achieves a user-defined behaviour (e.g. failure to compile on clang) and a; nonzero value when otherwise. Leaving the user the freedom to determine what is; and isn’t interesting to the tool, and thus, streamlining the process of; reducing a test-case. If the test accepts any arguments (excludin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md:281,test,test,281,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md,4,['test'],"['test', 'test-case']"
Testability,"# Collection Classes. Collections are a key feature of the ROOT system. Many, if not most, of; the applications you write will use collections. If you have used; parameterized C++ collections or polymorphic collections before, some of; this material will be review. However, much of this chapter covers; aspects of collections specific to the ROOT system. When you have read; this chapter, you will know. - How to create instances of collections. - The difference between lists, arrays, hash tables, maps, etc. - How to add and remove elements of a collection. - How to search a collection for a specific element. - How to access and modify collection elements. - How to iterate over a collection to access collection elements. - How to manage memory for collections and collection elements. - How collection elements are tested for equality (`IsEqual(`)). - How collection elements are compared (`Compare())` in case of sorted; collections. - How collection elements are hashed (`Hash()`) in hash tables. ## Understanding Collections. A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram; editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets; for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A; geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials; and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in; collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional; data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees. ### General Characteristics. The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to; `TObjects`, so:. - They can only hold objects that inherit from **`TObject`**. - They return pointers to `TObjects`, that have to be cast back to the; correct subclass. Collections are dynamic; they can grow in size as required. Collections; themselves are descendants of **`TObject`** so can themselves be h",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:822,test,tested,822,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"# Discourse Migration Guide . ## Current Status of Migration: Discourse is back online at a new URL: [https://discourse.llvm.org](https://discourse.llvm.org). The old one still works as well. We are aware of an issue with reply by email to emails from before the merge. We will update once we know more. This document is intended to help LLVM users to migrate from the mailing lists to; Discourse. Discourse has two basic ways for interaction: Via the [web; UI](https://llvm.discourse.group/) and via emails. ## Setting up your account. The easiest way is to create an account using your GitHub account:. 1. Navigate to https://llvm.discourse.group/; 1. Click on ""Sign Up"" in the top right corner.; 1. Choose ""With GitHub"" on the right side and log in with your GitHub account. ## Structure of Discourse. Discourse's structure is similar to a set of mailing lists, however different; terms are used there. To help with the transition, here's a translation table; for the terms:. <table border=1>; <tr><th>Mailing list</th><th>Discourse</th></tr>; <tr><td><i>Mailing list</i>, consists of threads</td><td><i>category</i>, consists of topics</td></tr>; <tr><td><i>thread</i>, consists of emails</td><td><i>topic</i>, consists of posts</td></tr>; <tr><td>email</td><td>post</td></tr>; </table>. ## Setting up email interactions. Some folks want to interact with Discourse purely via their email program. Here; are the typical use cases:. * You can [subscribe to a category or topic](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-subscribe-to-categories-and-topics/16024); * You can reply to a post, including quoting other peoples texts; ([tested](https://llvm.discourse.group/t/email-interaction-with-discourse/3306/4) on GMail).; * [Quoting previous topics in an reply](https://meta.discourse.org/t/single-quote-block-dropped-in-email-reply/144802); * You can filter incoming emails in your email client by category using the; `List-ID` email header field.; * You can create topics through email using the e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md:745,log,log,745,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"# Input/Output; \index{I/O}. This chapter covers the saving and reading of objects to and from ROOT; files. It begins with an explanation of the physical layout of a ROOT; file. It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then; we explain the logical file, the class **`TFile`** and its methods. We; show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back.; We also include a discussion on `Streamers`. `Streamers` are the methods; responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or; send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on; the two specialized ROOT files: **`TNetFile`** and **`TWebFile`**. ## The Physical Layout of ROOT Files. A ROOT file is like a UNIX file directory. It can contain directories; and objects organized in unlimited number of levels. It also is stored; in machine independent format (ASCII, IEEE floating point, Big Endian; byte ordering). To look at the physical layout of a ROOT file, we first; create one. This example creates a ROOT file and 15 histograms, fills; each histogram with 1000 entries from a Gaussian distribution, and; writes them to the file. ``` {.cpp}; {; char name[10], title[20];; TObjArray Hlist(0); // create an array of Histograms; TH1F* h; // create a pointer to a histogram; // make and fill 15 histograms and add them to the object array; for (Int_t i = 0; i < 15; i++) {; sprintf(name,""h%d"",i);; sprintf(title,""histo nr:%d"",i);; h = new TH1F(name,title,100,-4,4);; Hlist.Add(h);; h->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);; }; // open a file and write the array to the file; TFile f(""demo.root"",""recreate"");; Hlist.Write();; f.Close();; }; ```. The example begins with a call to the **`TFile`** constructor. This; class is describing the ROOT file (that has the extension ""`.root`""). In; the next section, we will cover **`TFile`** in details. The last line of; the example closes the file. To view its contents we need to open it; again, and to create a **`TBrowser`** object by:. ``` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:259,log,logical,259,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['log'],['logical']
Testability,"# Introduction. In the mid 1990's, René Brun and Fons Rademakers had many years of; experience developing interactive tools and simulation packages. They; had lead successful projects such as PAW, PIAF, and GEANT, and they; knew PAW the twenty-year-old FORTRAN libraries had reached their; limits. Although still very popular, these tools could not scale up to; the challenges offered by the Large Hadron Collider, where the data is; a few orders of magnitude larger than anything seen before. At the same time, computer science had made leaps of progress; especially in the area of Object Oriented Design, and René and Fons; were ready to take advantage of it. ROOT was developed in the context of the NA49 experiment at CERN. NA49; has generated an impressive amount of data, around 10 Terabytes per; run. This rate provided the ideal environment to develop and test the; next generation data analysis. ROOT was, and still is, developed in the ""Bazaar style"", a term from; the book ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" by Eric S. Raymond. It means a; liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse; and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists; developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate,; useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of; ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with; the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming; co-developers. When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics; plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow; close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time. They are; ready to use the true and tested technologies physics has invented. In; this way, other fields and industries have found ROOT useful and they; have started to use it also. In the bazaar view, software is released early and frequently to; expose it to thousands of eager co-developers to pound on, report; bugs, and",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:864,test,test,864,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"# ROOT Basics #. Now that you have installed ROOT, what's this interactive shell thing; you're running ? It's like this: ROOT leads a double life. It has an; interpreter for macros (Cling [@Cling]) that you can run from the command; line or run like applications. But it is also an interactive shell that; can evaluate arbitrary statements and expressions. This is extremely; useful for debugging, quick hacking and testing. Let us first have a; look at some very simple examples. ## ROOT as calculator ##. You can even use the ROOT interactive shell in lieu of a calculator!; Launch the ROOT interactive shell with the command. ``` {.cpp}; > root; ```. on your Linux box. The prompt should appear shortly:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0]; ```. and let's dive in with the steps shown here:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0] 1+1; (int) 2; root [1] 2*(4+2)/12.; (double) 1.000000; root [2] sqrt(3.); (double) 1.732051; root [3] 1 > 2; (bool) false; root [4] TMath::Pi(); (double) 3.141593; root [5] TMath::Erf(.2); (double) 0.222703; ```. Not bad. You can see that ROOT offers you the possibility not only to; type in `C++` statements, but also advanced mathematical functions,; which live in the `TMath` namespace. Now let's do something more elaborated. A numerical example with the; well known geometrical series:. ``` {.cpp}; root [6] double x=.5; (double) 0.500000; root [7] int N=30; (int) 30; root [8] double geom_series=0; (double) 0.000000; root [9] for (int i=0;i<N;++i)geom_series+=TMath::Power(x,i); root [10] cout << TMath::Abs(geom_series - (1-TMath::Power(x,N-1))/(1-x)) <<endl;; 1.86265e-09; ```. Here we made a step forward. We even declared variables and used a *for*; control structure. Note that there are some subtle differences between; Cling and the standard `C++` language. You do not need the "";"" at the end; of line in interactive mode -- try the difference e.g. using the command; at line `root [6]`. ## Learn C++ at the ROOT prompt ##; Behind the ROOT prompt there is an interpreter based on a rea",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md:416,test,testing,416,documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,1,['test'],['testing']
Testability,"# ROOT Development Practice. ## Overview. The development of ROOT almost exclusively happens using the [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests); model of github. A pull request (PR) should contain a set focused changes; organized in one or more [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Revision_control).; PRs should be well-documented and well-tested in order to allow other community; members to use, maintain and modify. If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; How",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/DEVELOPMENT.md:438,test,tested,438,README/DEVELOPMENT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/DEVELOPMENT.md,5,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmark', 'tested', 'tests']"
Testability,"# ROOT::TestSupport: the unit-test support library. This library supports ROOT's unit tests. It implements two main functions; 1. It provides a static library target `ROOT::TestSupport`. All google tests that are defined using `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` will be linked against this target.; When a test executable starts up, this will install a ROOT message handler that intercepts all messages / diagnostics.; If a message with severity > kInfo is issued, this message handler will register a test failure. This way, we are ensuring that no gtest can issue unnoticed warning or error messages.; 2. However, some warnings and errors are expected as the result of certain tests. Therefore, the library provides tools to declare when messages are expected during a test. For this,; 1. Include the header `ROOT/TestSupport.hxx`.; 2. Declare a RAII object that temporarily replaces the message handler from 1.; 3. Register the expected messages to this object, so it can check that they are indeed sent.

For example:. ``` {.cpp}; # loop over array tree element; for d in mychain.mydoubles:; print(d). # direct access into an array tree element; i5 = mychain.myints[5]; ```. #### Writing a Tree. Writing a ROOT **`TTree`** in a Python session is a little convoluted,; if only because you will need a C++ class to make sure that data members; can be mapped, unless you are working with built-in types. Here is an; example for working with the latter only:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from array import array. h = TH1F('h1','test',100,-10.,10.); f = TFile('test.root','recreate'); t = TTree('t1','tree with histos'); maxn = 10; n = array('i',[0]); d = array('f',maxn*[0.]); t.Branch('mynum',n,'mynum/I'); t.Branch('myval',d,'myval[mynum]/F'). for i in range(25):; n[0] = min(i,maxn); for j in range(n[0]):; d[j] = i*0.1+j; t.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); ```. The use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the; object that is used for filling must be given to the **`TTree::Branch()`**; call, even though the formal argument is declared a '`void*'`. In the; case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary,; because the full type information is available, and `TTree::Branch()`; has been Pythonized to take care of the call details. However, data; members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require; something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive; types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that; purpose, there is the `AddressOf()` function.

Testability,"# rootreadspeed. `rootreadspeed` is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in root analysis programs; by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in; certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files,; how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. ## Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually; saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total; number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data).; Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree.; Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including; decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. ## Interpreting results:. ### There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. - The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis,; ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time.; The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code (or the framework's),; parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible (for example with; [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html); and [EnableImplicitMT](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceROOT.html#a06f2b8b216b615e5abbc872c9feff40f)); or switch to a machine with a more performant CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'*.; If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the; bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive; or network connection in order to decompress it.; The best way to dec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:660,test,test,660,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"## Introduction to TableGen Part 1: Classes, Defs, Basic Types and Let. **Note:** The content in this notebook is adapted from [this document](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/index.html). Refer to it if you want more details. This tutorial will cover:; * Classes; * Defs; * Basic types; * `let` in various forms; * Class template arguments. ## What is TableGen?. TableGen is a language used in LLVM to automate the generation of certain types of code. Usually repetitive code that has a common structure. TableGen is used to generate ""records"" that are then processed by a ""backend"" into domain specific code. The compiler for TableGen is the binary `llvm-tblgen`. This contains the logic to convert TableGen source into records that can then be passed to a TableGen backend. TableGen allows you to define Classes and Defs (which are instances of classes) but it doesn't encode what to do with that structure. That's what the backend does. The backend converts this structure into something useful, for example C++ code. These backends are included in the `llvm-tblgen` binary and you can choose which one to run using a command line option. If you don't choose a backend you get a dump of the structure, and that is what this notebook will be showing. This tutorial will focus on the language itself only. The only thing you need to know now is that in addition to `llvm-tblgen` you will see other `*-tblgen` like `clang-tblgen`. The difference between them is the backends they include. The default output from `llvm-tblgen` looks like this:. ```tablegen; %config cellreset on. // Empty source file; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; ------------- Defs -----------------. **Note:** `%config` is not a TableGen command but a ""magic"" command to the Jupyter kernel for this notebook. By default new cells include the content of previously run cells, but for this notebook we mostly want each to be isolated. On occasion we will use the `%noreset` magic to override this.

ROOT offers a new class `TTreeReader` that gives simple, safe and fast access to the content of a `TTree`.; Using it is trivial:. ``` {.cpp}; #include ""TFile.h""; #include ""TH1F.h""; #include ""TTreeReader.h""; #include ""TTreeReaderValue.h"". void hsimpleReader() {; TH1F *myHist = new TH1F(""h1"",""ntuple"",100,-4,4);; TFile *myFile = TFile::Open(""hsimple.root"");. // Create a TTreeReader for the tree, for instance by passing the; // TTree's name and the TDirectory / TFile it is in.; TTreeReader myReader(""ntuple"", myFile);. // The branch ""px"" contains floats; access them as myPx.; TTreeReaderValue<Float_t> myPx(myReader, ""px"");; // The branch ""py"" contains floats, too; access those as myPy.; TTreeReaderValue<Float_t> myPy(myReader, ""py"");. // Loop over all entries of the TTree or TChain.; while (myReader.Next()) {; // Just access the data as if myPx and myPy were iterators (note the '*'; // in front of them):; myHist->Fill(*myPx + *myPy);; }. myHist->Draw();; }; ```. TTreeReader checks whether the type that you expect can be extracted from the tree's branch and will clearly complain if not.; It reads on demand: only data that are actually needed are read, there is no need for `SetBranchStatus()`, `SetBranchAddress()`, `LoadTree()` or anything alike.; It uses the memory management of TTree, removing possible double deletions or memory leaks and relieveing you from the need to manage the memory yourself.; It turns on the tree cache, accelerating the reading of data.; It has been extensively tested on all known types of TTree branches and is thus a generic, fits-all access method for data stored in TTrees. ### TTreePlayer. - The TEntryList for ||-Coord plot was not defined correctly.

Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command. Example:. ```bash; % cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=path/to/clang \; -C ../test-suite/cmake/caches/target-arm64-iphoneos-internal.cmake \; -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -D TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST=mydevice \; ../test-suite; % ninja; % ninja rsync; % llvm-lit -j1 -o result.json .; ```. - You can specify a simulator for the target machine with the; `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER` setting.

Testability,"#. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself. The ``-oop-executor`` and ``-oop-executor-connect`` options are helpful for testing; handling of cross-process and cross-architecture use cases. Roadmap; =======. JITLink is under active development. Work so far has focused on the MachO; implementation. In LLVM 12 there is limited support for ELF on x86-64. Major outstanding projects include:. * Refactor architecture support to maximize sharing across formats. All formats should be able to share the bulk of the architecture specific; code (especially relocations) for each supported architecture. * Refactor ELF link graph construction. ELF's link graph construction is currently implemented in the `ELF_x86_64.cpp`; file, and tied to the x86-64 relocation parsing code. The bulk of the code is; generic and should be split into an ELFLinkGraphBuilder base class along the; same lines as the existing generic MachOLinkGraphBuilder. * Implement support for arm32. * Implement support for other new architectures.

Returns have a simple mitigation technique on x86-64 (or other ABIs which have; what is called a ""red zone"" region beyond the end of the stack). This region is; guaranteed to be preserved across interrupts and context switches, making the; return address used in returning to the current code remain on the stack and; valid to read. We can emit code in the caller to verify that a return edge was; not mispredicted:; ```; callq other_function; return_addr:; testq -8(%rsp), return_addr # Validate return address.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Update predicate state.; ```. For an ABI without a ""red zone"" (and thus unable to read the return address; from the stack), we can compute the expected return address prior to the call; into a register preserved across the call and use that similarly to the above. Indirect calls (and returns in the absence of a red zone ABI) pose the most; significant challenge to propagate. The simplest technique would be to define a; new ABI such that the intended call target is passed into the called function; and checked in the entry. Unfortunately, new ABIs are quite expensive to deploy; in C and C++. While the target function could be passed in TLS, we would still; require complex logic to handle a mixture of functions compiled with and; without this extra logic (essentially, making the ABI backwards compatible).; Currently, we suggest using retpolines here and will continue to investig",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:19550,test,testq,19550,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['test'],['testq']

Under normal circumstances these objects could not be linked together:; ``function_to_test`` is static and could not be resolved outside; ``test_code.o``, the two ``function_to_mock`` functions would result in a; duplicate definition error, and ``irrelevant_external`` is undefined.; However, using ``-harness`` and ``-phony-externals`` we can run this code; with:. .. code-block:: sh. % clang -c -o test_code_harness.o test_code_harness.c; % llvm-jitlink -phony-externals test_code.o -harness test_code_harness.o; used mock utility function; Y is 42.

Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``.

We should use movmskp{s|d} instead. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. CodeGen/X86/vec_align.ll tests whether we can turn 4 scalar loads into a single; (aligned) vector load. This functionality has a couple of problems. 1. The code to infer alignment from loads of globals is in the X86 backend,; not the dag combiner. This is because dagcombine2 needs to be able to see; through the X86ISD::Wrapper node, which DAGCombine can't really do.; 2. The code for turning 4 x load into a single vector load is target ; independent and should be moved to the dag combiner.; 3. The code for turning 4 x load into a vector load can only handle a direct ; load from a global or a direct load from the stack. It should be generalized; to handle any load from P, P+4, P+8, P+12, where P can be anything.; 4. The alignment inference code cannot handle loads from globals in non-static; mode because it doesn't look through the extra dyld stub load. If you try; vec_align.ll without -relocation-model=static, you'll see what I mean. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. We should lower store(fneg(load p), q) into an integer load+xor+store, which; eliminates a constant pool load.

Testability,"'pyf2',Linear(),-1.,1.,2); f.SetParameters(5.,2.). # plot the function; c = TCanvas(); f.Draw(); ```. Note that this time the constructor is told that there are two; parameters, and note in particular how these parameters are set. It is,; of course, also possible (and preferable if you only use the function; for plotting) to keep the parameters as data members of the callable; instance and use and set them directly from Python. #### Fitting Histograms. Fitting a histogram with a Python function is no more difficult than; plotting: instantiate a **`TF1`** with the Python callable and supply; that **`TF1`** as a parameter to the `Fit()` member function of the; histogram. After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the; **`TF1`** instance. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # create a linear function for fitting; f = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2). # create and fill a histogram; h = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.); f2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.); h.FillRandom('cf2',10000). # fit the histo with the python 'linear' function; h.Fit(f). # print results; par = f.GetParameters(); print('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1]); ```. ### Working with Trees. Next to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most; common part of any analysis. The **`TTree`** implementation uses; pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed; up access. Consequently, mapping **`TTree`** functionality to Python is; not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented; in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if; you require all of them. #### Accessing an Existing Tree. Let us assume that you have a file containing **`TTrees`**,; **`TChains`**, or **`TNtuples`** and want to read the contents for use; in your analysis code. This is commonly the case when you work with the; result of the reconstruct",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:27954,test,test,27954,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"'s a bit of a grey area what; should be fixed before the next candidate and what can wait until the next; release. It'll depend on:. * The severity of the bug, how many people it affects and if it's a regression; or a known bug. Known bugs are ""unsupported features"" and some bugs can be; disabled if they have been implemented recently. * The stage in the release. Less critical bugs should be considered to be; fixed between RC1 and RC2, but not so much at the end of it. * If it's a correctness or a performance regression. Performance regression; tends to be taken more lightly than correctness. .. _scripts:. Scripts; =======. The scripts are in the ``utils/release`` directory. test-release.sh; ---------------. This script will check-out, configure and compile LLVM+Clang (+ most add-ons,; like ``compiler-rt``, ``libcxx``, ``libomp`` and ``clang-extra-tools``) in; three stages, and will test the final stage.; It'll have installed the final binaries on the Phase3/Releasei(+Asserts); directory, and that's the one you should use for the test-suite and other; external tests. To run the script on a specific release candidate run::. ./test-release.sh \; -release 3.3 \; -rc 1 \; -no-64bit \; -test-asserts \; -no-compare-files. Each system will require different options. For instance, x86_64 will; obviously not need ``-no-64bit`` while 32-bit systems will, or the script will; fail. The important flags to get right are:. * On the pre-release, you should change ``-rc 1`` to ``-final``. On RC2,; change it to ``-rc 2`` and so on. * On non-release testing, you can use ``-final`` in conjunction with; ``-no-checkout``, but you'll have to create the ``final`` directory by hand; and link the correct source dir to ``final/llvm.src``. * For release candidates, you need ``-test-asserts``, or it won't create a; ""Release+Asserts"" directory, which is needed for release testing and; benchmarking. This will take twice as long. * On the final candidate you just need Release builds, and that's th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseProcess.rst:1967,test,test-suite,1967,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseProcess.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseProcess.rst,2,['test'],"['test-suite', 'tests']"

It's worth; handling these extras to give your expression complete integration into; Clang:. * Add code completion support for your expression in; ``SemaCodeComplete.cpp``.; * If your expression has types in it, or has any ""interesting"" features; other than subexpressions, extend libclang's ``CursorVisitor`` to provide; proper visitation for your expression, enabling various IDE features such; as syntax highlighting, cross-referencing, and so on. The; ``c-index-test`` helper program can be used to test these features. Testing; -------; All functional changes to Clang should come with test coverage demonstrating; the change in behavior. .. _verifying-diagnostics:. Verifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang ``-cc1`` supports the ``-verify`` command line option as a way to; validate diagnostic behavior. This option will use special comments within the; test file to verify that expected diagnostics appear in the correct source; locations. If all of the expected diagnostics match the actual output of Clang,; then the invocation will return normally. If there are discrepancies between; the expected and actual output, Clang will emit detailed information about; which expected diagnostics were not seen or which unexpected diagnostics were; seen, etc. A complete example is:. .. code-block: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify %s; int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. If the test is run and the expected error is emitted on the expected line, the; diagnostic verifier will pass. However, if the expected error does not appear; or appears in a different location than expected, or if additional diagnostics; appear, the diagnostic verifier will fail and emit information as to why. The ``-verify`` command optionally accepts a comma-delimited list of one or; more verification prefixes that can be used to craft those special comments.; Each pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:154726,test,test,154726,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

However, the information they impart may be essential to; understanding the logging text even after symbolization. So it's recommended; that this information be preserved in some form when the original raw log with; markup may no longer be readily accessible for whatever reason. Contextual elements should appear in the logging stream before they are needed.; That is, if some piece of context may affect how the symbolizing filter would; interpret or present a later presentation element, the necessary contextual; elements should have appeared somewhere earlier in the logging stream. It should; always be possible for the symbolizing filter to be implemented as a single pass; over the raw logging stream, accumulating context and massaging text as it goes. ``{{{reset}}}``.

Proper error handling helps us identify bugs in our code, and helps end-users; understand errors in their tool usage. Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply.

Testability,"). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirect",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:47590,test,test,47590,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Speed of four matrix operations have been compared between four matrix; libraries, `GSL` `CLHEP`, `ROOT v3.10` and `ROOT v4.0`. Next figure; shows the `CPU` time for these four operations as a function of the; matrix size:. 1. `A*B` The execution time is measured for the sum of A \* Bsym,; Bsym\* A and A \* B. Notice the matrix\_size3 dependence of execution; time. `CLHEP` results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric; matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size; 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A \* Bsym takes 0.028 sec and; Bsym\* A takes 0.059 sec. Both `GSL` and `ROOT v4.0` can be setup to use the hardware-optimized; multiplication routines of the `BLAS` libraries. It was tested on a G4; PowerPC. The improvement becomes clearly visible around sizes of (50x50); were the execution speed improvement of the Altivec processor becomes; more significant than the overhead of filling its pipe. 2. $A^{-1}$ Here, the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion.

Well, this is a case when we can just replace *G* with *F*; everywhere, we use ``replaceAllUsesWith`` operation here (*RAUW*). 2. *F* could not be overridden, while *G* could. It would be good to do the; next: after merging the places where overridable function were used, still use; overridable stub. So try to make *G* alias to *F*, or create overridable tail; call wrapper around *F* and replace *G* with that call. 3. Neither *F* nor *G* could be overridden. We can't use *RAUW*.

Figure out; what the correct thing to do is, and write it down here. #. Configure and build ``llvm``. #. Configure and build ``llvm-gcc``. #. Install ``llvm-gcc`` somewhere. #. *Re-configure* ``llvm`` from the top level of each build tree (LLVM; object directory tree) in which you want to run the test suite, just; as you do before building LLVM. During the *re-configuration*, you must either: (1) have ``llvm-gcc``; you just built in your path, or (2) specify the directory where your; just-built ``llvm-gcc`` is installed using; ``--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR``. You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR]. [Remember that ``$LLVM_GCC_DIR`` is the directory where you; *installed* llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.]. #.

Structure; ---------. The test-suite contains benchmark and test programs. The programs come with; reference outputs so that their correctness can be checked. The suite comes; with tools to collect metrics such as benchmark runtime, compilation time and; code size. The test-suite is divided into several directories:. - `SingleSource/`. Contains test programs that are only a single source file in size. A; subdirectory may contain several programs. - `MultiSource/`. Contains subdirectories which entire programs with multiple source files.; Large benchmarks and whole applications go here. - `MicroBenchmarks/`. Programs using the [google-benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark); library. The programs define functions that are run multiple times until the; measurement results are statistically significant. - `External/`. Contains descriptions and test data for code that cannot be directly; distributed with the test-suite. The most prominent members of this; directory are the SPEC CPU benchmark suites.; See [External Suites](#external-suites). - `Bitcode/`. These tests are mostly written in LLVM bitcode. - `CTMark/`.

Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments.

For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own.

If you choose to not use the default logging implementation that comes with the; XRay runtime and/or control when/how the XRay instrumentation runs, you may use; the XRay APIs directly for doing so. To do this, you'll need to include the; ``xray_log_interface.h`` from the compiler-rt ``xray`` directory. The important API; functions we list below:. - ``__xray_log_register_mode(...)``: Register a logging implementation against; a string Mode identifier. The implementation is an instance of; ``XRayLogImpl`` defined in ``xray/xray_log_interface.h``.; - ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``: Select the mode to install, associated with; a string Mode identifier. Only implementations registered with; ``__xray_log_register_mode(...)`` can be chosen with this function.; - ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``: This function allows for initializing and; re-initializing an installed logging implementation. See; ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` for details, part of the XRay compiler-rt; installation. Once a logging implementation has been initialized, it can be ""stopped"" by; finalizing the implementation through the ``__xray_log_finalize()`` function.; The finalization routine is the opposite of the initialization. When finalized,; an implementation's data can be cleared out through the; ``__xray_log_flushLog()`` function. For implementations that support in-memory; processing, these should register an iterator function to provide access to the; data via the ``__xray_log_set_buffer_iterator(...)`` which allows code calling; the ``__xray_log_process_buffers(...)`` function to deal with the data in; memory. All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------.

Testability,", and a source file that imports both modules *in any order* will not see ``getc`` defined as a macro. Module Map Language; ===================. .. warning::. The module map language is not currently guaranteed to be stable between major revisions of Clang. The module map language describes the mapping from header files to the; logical structure of modules. To enable support for using a library as; a module, one must write a ``module.modulemap`` file for that library. The; ``module.modulemap`` file is placed alongside the header files themselves,; and is written in the module map language described below. .. note::; For compatibility with previous releases, if a module map file named; ``module.modulemap`` is not found, Clang will also search for a file named; ``module.map``. This behavior is deprecated and we plan to eventually; remove it. As an example, the module map file for the C standard library might look a bit like this:. .. parsed-literal::. module std [system] [extern_c] {; module assert {; textual header ""assert.h""; header ""bits/assert-decls.h""; export *; }. module complex {; header ""complex.h""; export *; }. module ctype {; header ""ctype.h""; export *; }. module errno {; header ""errno.h""; header ""sys/errno.h""; export *; }. module fenv {; header ""fenv.h""; export *; }. // ...more headers follow...; }. Here, the top-level module ``std`` encompasses the whole C standard library. It has a number of submodules containing different parts of the standard library: ``complex`` for complex numbers, ``ctype`` for character types, etc. Each submodule lists one of more headers that provide the contents for that submodule. Finally, the ``export *`` command specifies that anything included by that submodule will be automatically re-exported. Lexical structure; -----------------; Module map files use a simplified form of the C99 lexer, with the same rules for identifiers, tokens, string literals, ``/* */`` and ``//`` comments.

Testability,", but that is target specific. .. _dso_local_equivalent:. DSO Local Equivalent; --------------------. ``dso_local_equivalent @func``. A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol. This is especially useful for the Relative VTables C++ ABI,; where dynamic relocations for function pointers in VTables can be replaced with; static relocations for offsets between the VTable and virtual functions which; may not be ``dso_local``.

In the example above, the first index is indexing into the; '``%struct.ST*``' type, which is a pointer, yielding a '``%struct.ST``'; = '``{ i32, double, %struct.RT }``' type, a structure. The second index; indexes into the third element of the structure, yielding a; '``%struct.RT``' = '``{ i8 , [10 x [20 x i32]], i8 }``' type, another; structure. The third index indexes into the second element of the; structure, yielding a '``[10 x [20 x i32]]``' type, an array. The two; dimensions of the array are subscripted into, yielding an '``i32``'; type. The '``getelementptr``' instruction returns a pointer to this; element. Note that it is perfectly legal to index partially through a structure,; returning a pointer to an inner element.

Testability,", is simple to understand and; its performance characteristics are easy to reason about. However, it will lead; to very high startup times if the amount of code to be compiled is large, and; may also do a lot of unnecessary compilation if only a few compiled functions; are ever called at runtime. A truly ""just-in-time"" compiler should allow us to; defer the compilation of any given function until the moment that function is; first called, improving launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst:2166,stub,stub,2166,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,1,['stub'],['stub']

The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models.

AST File Contents; -----------------. An AST file produced by clang is an object file container with a ``clangast``; (COFF) or ``__clangast`` (ELF and Mach-O) section containing the serialized AST.; Other target-specific sections in the object file container are used to hold; debug information for the data types defined in the AST. Tools built on top of; libclang that do not need debug information may also produce raw AST files that; only contain the serialized AST. The ``clangast`` section is organized into several different blocks, each of; which contains the serialized representation of a part of Clang's internal; representation. Each of the blocks corresponds to either a block or a record; within `LLVM's bitstream format <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_.; The contents of each of these logical blocks are described below. .. image:: PCHLayout.png. The ``llvm-objdump`` utility provides a ``-raw-clang-ast`` option to extract the; binary contents of the AST section from an object file container.

Testability,",; bit addressing, the ability for composite location descriptions to be composed; of any kind of location description, and the ability to support objects located; at multiple places. Collectively these changes expand the set of architectures; that can be supported and improves support for optimized code. Several approaches were considered, and the one presented, together with the; extensions it enables, appears to be the simplest and cleanest one that offers; the greatest improvement of DWARF's ability to support debugging optimized GPU; and non-GPU code. Examining the GDB debugger and LLVM compiler, it appears only; to require modest changes as they both already have to support general use of; location descriptions. It is anticipated that will also be the case for other; debuggers and compilers. GDB has been modified to evaluate DWARF Version 5 expressions with location; descriptions as stack entries and with implicit conversions. All GDB tests have; passed, except one that turned out to be an invalid test case by DWARF Version 5; rules. The code in GDB actually became simpler as all evaluation is done on a; single stack and there was no longer a need to maintain a separate structure for; the location description results. This gives confidence in backwards; compatibility. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-expressions` and nested sections. This extension is separately described at *Allow Location Descriptions on the; DWARF Expression Stack* [:ref:`AMDGPU-DWARF-LOC; <amdgpu-dwarf-AMDGPU-DWARF-LOC>`]. 2.2 Generalize CFI to Allow Any Location Description Kind; ---------------------------------------------------------. CFI describes restoring callee saved registers that are spilled. Currently CFI; only allows a location description that is a register, memory address, or; implicit location description. AMDGPU optimized code may spill scalar registers; into portions of vector registers. This requires extending CFI to allow any; location description kind to be supported.

Each reference has the correct type, e.g. w::gauss is; a RooGaussian&. If a workspace is deleted from memory, the corresponding CINT namespace; is removed as well. Note that this feature is strictly available in interpreted C++ only; A new tutorial macro has been added to illustrate this functionality in more detail: rf509_wsinteractive.C.; writeToFile -- A new utility method RooWorkspace::writeToFile() has been added; to simplify the process of saving a workspace to file; Named sets and parameter snapshots -- It is now possible to define and retrieve; named RooArgSets of objects that live in the workspace through methods; defineSet() and set(). While named sets merely group objects logically, methods loadSnapshot and; saveSnapshot allow to make copies of the values, errors and 'constant' status of; sets of variable objects that live in the workspace. A newly added tutorial macro rf510_namedsets.C illustrates the functionality of both; of these features.; Improved printing of contents -- Many operator p.d.f. and function components now show; a more intuitive natural representation of their contents (these changes are mostly in the; respective p.d.f.s, but are most relevant in the context of a workspace). New object factory interface to workspace to facilitate script driven model definition; A object factory has been added to RooFit to simplify the process of creating p.d.f.; and function expressions consisting of multiple objects. The factory has two goals:; the first is to provide a back-end for higher level factories and tools to process; the creation of objects. The second is to provide a simple end-user language to; populate a RooWorkspace with function and p.d.f. objects. For the latter purpose the object creation language ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v524/index.html:17529,log,logically,17529,roofit/doc/v524/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v524/index.html,2,['log'],['logically']

Valid values are:. * ``off`` (Disable auto-generation of preprocessed source files during a clang crash.); * ``compiler`` (Generate diagnostics for compiler crashes (default)); * ``all`` (Generate diagnostics for all tools which support it). .. option:: -fno-crash-diagnostics.

Testability,"----------. New versions of Clang should be able to use configuration written for earlier; Clang versions.; To avoid behaving in a way that may be subtly incorrect, Clang should be able; to detect if the configuration is too new and emit an error. Forwards compatibility; ----------------------. As an author of a multilib configuration, it should be possible to design the; configuration in such a way that it is likely to work well with future Clang; versions. For example, if a future version of Clang is likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------.

The naive lowering select between two different values. It should recognize the; test is equality test so it's more a conditional move rather than a select:; cmp r0, #1; movne r0, #0. Currently this is a ARM specific dag combine. We probably should make it into a; target-neutral one. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Optimize unnecessary checks for zero with __builtin_clz/ctz. Those builtins; are specified to be undefined at zero, so portable code must check for zero; and handle it as a special case. That is unnecessary on ARM where those; operations are implemented in a way that is well-defined for zero. For; example:. int f(int x) { return x ? __builtin_clz(x) : sizeof(int)*8; }. should just be implemented with a CLZ instruction. Since there are other; targets, e.g., PPC, that share this behavior, it would be best to implement; this in a target-independent way: we should probably fold that (when using; ""undefined at zero"" semantics) to set the ""defined at zero"" bit and have; the code generator expand out the right code. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//.

Testability,"---------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file. For example, :program:`opt` by; default outputs a ``ModuleID``:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat example.ll; define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. $ opt -S /path/to/example.ll; ; ModuleID = '/path/to/example.ll'. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. ``ModuleID`` can unexpectedly match against ``CHECK`` lines. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory. To make your tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available.

Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To use FDR mode; on your application, you may set the ``xray_mode`` variable to ``xray-fdr`` in; the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Additional options to the FDR mode; implementation can be provided in the ``XRAY_FDR_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. Programmatic configuration can be done by calling; ``__xray_log_init_mode(""xray-fdr"", <configuration string>)`` once it has been; selected/installed.

For example, by the above rules, we can't transform; fmul(sitofp(x), 0.0) into 0.0, because x might be -1 and the result of the; expression is defined to be -0.0. If we look at the uses of the fmul for example, we might be able to prove that; all uses don't care about the sign of zero. For example, if we have:. fadd(fmul(sitofp(x), 0.0), 2.0). Since we know that x+2.0 doesn't care about the sign of any zeros in X, we can; transform the fmul to 0.0, and then the fadd to 2.0. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. We should enhance memcpy/memcpy/memset to allow a metadata node on them; indicating that some bytes of the transfer are undefined. This is useful for; frontends like clang when lowering struct copies, when some elements of the; struct are undefined. Consider something like this:. struct x {; char a;; int b[4];; };; void foo(struct x*P);; struct x testfunc() {; struct x V1, V2;; foo(&V1);; V2 = V1;. return V2;; }.

Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names; (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. ""Development""), and; then setting the *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:3766,test,testing,3766,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests.

Periodically restart both fuzzers so that they can use each other's findings.; Currently, there is no simple way to run both fuzzing engines in parallel while sharing the same corpus dir. You may also use AFL on your target function ``LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput``:; see an example `here <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/afl>`__. How good is my fuzzer?; ----------------------. Once you implement your target function ``LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`` and fuzz it to death,; you will want to know whether the function or the corpus can be improved further.; One easy to use metric is, of course, code coverage. We recommend to use; `Clang Coverage <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html>`_,; to visualize and study your code coverage; (`example <https://github.com/google/fuzzer-test-suite/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md#visualizing-coverage>`_).

LibFuzzer allows to use custom (user-supplied) mutators, see; `Structure-Aware Fuzzing <https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md>`_; for more details. Startup initialization; ----------------------; If the library being tested needs to be initialized, there are several options. The simplest way is to have a statically initialized global object inside; `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` (or in global scope if that works for you):. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {; static bool Initialized = DoInitialization();; ... Alternatively, you may define an optional init function and it will receive; the program arguments that you can read and modify.

Testability,"-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``). Extra files; -----------. If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: split-file %s %t; ; RUN: llvm-link -S %t/a.ll %t/b.ll | FileCheck %s. ; CHECK: ... ;--- a.ll; ...; ;--- b.ll; ... The parts are separated by the regex ``^(.|//)--- <part>``. If you want to test relative line numbers like ``[[#@LINE+1]]``, specify; ``--leading-lines`` to add leading empty lines to preserve line numbers.

Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command. Example:. ```bash; % cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=path/to/clang \; -C ../test-suite/cmake/caches/target-arm64-iphoneos-internal.cmake \; -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -D TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST=mydevice \; ../test-suite; % ninja; % ninja rsync; % llvm-lit -j1 -o result.json .; ```. - You can specify a simulator for the target machine with the; `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER` setting. The lit runner will prefix all benchmark; invocations with it. Running the test-suite via LNT; ------------------------------. The LNT tool can run the test-suite. Use this when submitting test results to; an LNT instance. See; [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite); for details. Running the test-suite via Makefiles (deprecated); -------------------------------------------------. **Note**: The test-suite comes with a set of Makefiles that are considered; deprecated.

Creating coverage reports; =========================. Raw profiles have to be **indexed** before they can be used to generate; coverage reports. This is done using the ""merge"" tool in ``llvm-profdata``; (which can combine multiple raw profiles and index them at the same time):. .. code-block:: console. # Step 3(a): Index the raw profile.; % llvm-profdata merge -sparse foo.profraw -o foo.profdata. For an example of merging multiple profiles created by testing,; see the LLVM `coverage build script <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-zorg/blob/main/zorg/jenkins/jobs/jobs/llvm-coverage>`_. There are multiple different ways to render coverage reports. The simplest; option is to generate a line-oriented report:. .. code-block:: console. # Step 3(b): Create a line-oriented coverage report.; % llvm-cov show ./foo -instr-profile=foo.profdata. This report includes a summary view as well as dedicated sub-views for; templated functions and their instantiations. For our example program, we get; distinct views for ``foo<int>(...)`` and ``foo<float>(...)``.

Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work.

That is, the; framework should have contents like:. .. code-block:: none. .../TestFramework.framework; .../TestFramework.framework/.system_framework; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers/TestFramework.h; ... Clang will treat the presence of this file as an indicator that the framework; should be treated as a system framework, regardless of how it was found in the; framework search path. For consistency, we recommend that such files never be; included in installed versions of the framework. Checks for Standard Language Features; =====================================. The ``__has_feature`` macro can be used to query if certain standard language; features are enabled. The ``__has_extension`` macro can be used to query if; language features are available as an extension when compiling for a standard; which does not provide them. The features which can be tested are listed here. Since Clang 3.4, the C++ SD-6 feature test macros are also supported.; These are macros with names of the form ``__cpp_<feature_name>``, and are; intended to be a portable way to query the supported features of the compiler.; See `the C++ status page <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#ts>`_ for; information on the version of SD-6 supported by each Clang release, and the; macros provided by that revision of the recommendations. C++98; -----. The features listed below are part of the C++98 standard. These features are; enabled by default when compiling C++ code. C++ exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(cxx_exceptions)`` to determine if C++ exceptions have been; enabled. For example, compiling code with ``-fno-exceptions`` disables C++; exceptions. C++ RTTI; ^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(cxx_rtti)`` to determine if C++ RTTI has been enabled. For; example, compiling code with ``-fno-rtti`` disables the use of RTTI. C++11; -----.

The individual test files include comments at the; beginning indicating the Clang compile options to use, to be read; by the test runner. Embedded comments also can do things like telling; the test runner that an error is expected at the current line.; Any output files produced by the test will be placed under; a created Output directory.; During the run of make test, the terminal output will; display a line similar to the following:; --- Running clang tests for i686-pc-linux-gnu ---; followed by a line continually overwritten with the current test; file being compiled, and an overall completion percentage.; After the make test run completes, the absence of any; Failing Tests (count): message indicates that no tests; failed unexpectedly. If any tests did fail, the; Failing Tests (count): message will be followed by a list; of the test source file paths that failed. For example:. Failing Tests (3):; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/member-name-lookup.cpp; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/namespace-alias.cpp; /home/john/llvm/tools/clang/test/SemaCXX/using-directive.cpp. If you used the make VERBOSE=1 option, the terminal; output will reflect the error messages from the compiler and; test runner.; The regression suite can also be run with Valgrind by running; make test VG=1 in the top-level clang directory.; For more intensive changes, running; the LLVM; Test Suite with clang is recommended.

Typically regular expressions are used; to match parts of the triple (for example, ``target={{.*}}-windows{{.*}}``; to match any Windows target triple). | ``REQUIRES`` enables the test if all expressions are true.; | ``UNSUPPORTED`` disables the test if any expression is true.; | ``XFAIL`` expects the test to fail if any expression is true.

Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify.

In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use).

The program stress takes one argument, the number of events to process.; The default is 1000 events. Be aware that executing stress with 1000; events*will create several files consuming about 100 MB of disk space;*; running stress with 30 events will consume about 20 MB. The disk space; is released once stress is done. There are two ways to run `stress`:. From the system prompt or from the ROOT prompt using the interpreter. ``` {.cpp}; > cd $ROOTSYS/test; > stress // default 1000 events; > stress 30 // test with 30 events; ```. Start ROOT with the batch mode option (-b) to suppress the graphic; output. ``` {.cpp}; > root -b; root[] .L stress.cxx; root[] stress(1000)// test with 1000 events; root[] stress(30)// test with 30 events; ```. The output of stress includes a pass/fail conclusion for each test, the; total number of bytes read and written, and the elapsed real and CPU; time.

As a result,; the surrounding ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives cannot be reordered, i.e. all; occurrences matching ``CHECK-DAG:`` before ``CHECK-NOT:`` must not fall behind; occurrences matching ``CHECK-DAG:`` after ``CHECK-NOT:``. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK-DAG: BEFORE; ; CHECK-NOT: NOT; ; CHECK-DAG: AFTER. This case will reject input strings where ``BEFORE`` occurs after ``AFTER``. With captured variables, ``CHECK-DAG:`` is able to match valid topological; orderings of a DAG with edges from the definition of a variable to its use.; It's useful, e.g., when your test cases need to match different output; sequences from the instruction scheduler.

Testability,". .. note::. For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem. The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``. We can also go further still, as many of GlobalISel's passes are readily unit; testable:. .. image:: testing-unit-level.png. It's possible to create an imaginary target such as in `LegalizerHelperTest.cpp <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/93b29d3882baf7df42e4e9bc26b977b00373ef56/llvm/unittests/CodeGen/GlobalISel/LegalizerHelperTest.cpp#L28-L57>`_; and perform a single step of the algorithm and check the result. The MIR and; FileCheck directives can be embedded using strings so you still have access to; the convenience available in llvm-lit. Debugging; ---------. One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png.

Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above.

So, create yet another build directory,; with the following CMake arguments:. - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 2.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang++`` - Same as above. If your users are fans of debug info, you may want to consider using; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`` instead of; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``.

Testability,". COMPARISON MODE; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; In this mode :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` compares logical views; to produce a report with the logical elements that are missing or added.; This a very powerful aid in finding semantic differences in the debug; information produced by different toolchain versions or even completely; different toolchains altogether (For example a compiler producing DWARF; can be directly compared against a completely different compiler that; produces CodeView). Given the previous example we found the above debug information issue; (related to the previous invalid scope location for the **'typedef int; INTEGER'**) by comparing against another compiler. Using GCC to generate test-dwarf-gcc.o, we can apply a selection pattern; with the printing mode to obtain the following logical view output. .. code-block:: none. llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level; --select-regex --select-nocase --select=INTe; --report=list; --print=symbols,types; test-dwarf-clang.o test-dwarf-gcc.o.

The output shows that both objects contain the same elements. But the; **'typedef INTEGER'** is located at different scope level. The GCC; generated object, shows **'4'**, which is the correct value. Note that there is no requirement that GCC must produce identical or; similar DWARF to Clang to allow the comparison. We're only comparing; the semantics.

Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.

Testability,". Core. The ROOT source directory has been drastically reorganized and simplified.; Each source directory containing the code for a single library or plugin,; were all in the same top level directory, without logical grouping.; This made it difficult to see which libraries were related and belonged; together. In the new structure we've added a set of meta directories; that are used to group the sources of related libraries, and that also; reflects the ROOT team work package structure.; Note, the name and number of libraries has not been changed.; This new structure also facilitates the maintaining of the release notes; and other documentation items per meta package. On Linux, MacOS X and Windows, there is no need anymore to define the; environment variable ROOTSYS. Internally ROOTSYS is set depending on the; location of the ROOT libraries. ROOTSYS was never needed when ROOT was; configured using --prefix. On MacOS X when configure'ing with --enable-rpath (and not specifying; --prefix) the installation does not need (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set; anymore. The installation is completely relocatable. The (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH; is determined relative to the location of the root executable. On Windows .root files are now associated with the most recently executed; ROOT installation, i.e. run ROOT once and .root files open with ROOT.

Creating Patch Files; LLVM IR Generation. Coding Standards. Clang follows the; LLVM Coding; Standards. When submitting patches, please take care to follow these standards; and to match the style of the code to that present in Clang (for example, in; terms of indentation, bracing, and statement spacing).; Clang has a few additional coding standards:. cstdio is forbidden: library code should not output diagnostics; or other information using cstdio; debugging routines should; use llvm::errs(). Other uses of cstdio impose behavior; upon clients and block integrating Clang as a library. Libraries should; support raw_ostream based interfaces for textual; output. See Coding; Standards. Developer Documentation. Both Clang and LLVM use doxygen to provide API documentation. Their; respective web pages (generated nightly) are here:. Clang; LLVM. For work on the LLVM IR generation, the LLVM assembly language; reference manual is; also useful. Debugging. Inspecting data structures in a debugger:. Many LLVM and Clang data structures provide; a dump() method which will print a description of the; data structure to stderr.; The QualType; structure is used pervasively. This is a simple value class for; wrapping types with qualifiers; you can use; the isConstQualified(), for example, to get one of the; qualifiers, and the getTypePtr() method to get the; wrapped Type* which you can then dump.; For LLDB users there are; data formatters for clang data structures in; ; clang/utils/ClangDataFormat.py.

Fix schema evolution problem in TTree::Draw by extending support in; TStreamerInfo::ReadValueAux to 'converted' numerical types, (; see issue in ROOT forum). When reading more than one TStreamerInfo for the same versioned; class, we now use the highest possible class version as the current; version of the class. Practically, we update the class version; when reading new (higher versioned) StreamerInfo until the Class; is actually used (i.e. TClass::GetClassVersion is call directly; or indirectly). In particular, if a file has several StreamerInfos for the same; versioned class, we will use the highest version number as the; 'current' class version (as opposed to the lowest until now). For backward compatibility TStreamerInfo::BuildCheck compares the checksum of; the on-file StreamerInfo not only to the current value of the class checksum; but also to the checksum calculated using the older algorithms.

This is useful in many; circumstances, for example, testing different architectural variants with; :program:`llc`. Here's a simple example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llc -mtriple=i686-apple-darwin9 -mattr=sse41 \; ; RUN: | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=X32; ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llc -mtriple=x86_64-apple-darwin9 -mattr=sse41 \; ; RUN: | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=X64. define <4 x i32> @pinsrd_1(i32 %s, <4 x i32> %tmp) nounwind {; %tmp1 = insertelement <4 x i32>; %tmp, i32 %s, i32 1; ret <4 x i32> %tmp1; ; X32: pinsrd_1:; ; X32: pinsrd $1, 4(%esp), %xmm0. ; X64: pinsrd_1:; ; X64: pinsrd $1, %edi, %xmm0; }. In this case, we're testing that we get the expected code generation with; both 32-bit and 64-bit code generation. The ""COM:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes you want to disable a FileCheck directive without removing it; entirely, or you want to write comments that mention a directive by name. The; ""``COM:``"" directive makes it easy to do this. For example, you might have:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; X32: pinsrd_1:; ; X32: pinsrd $1, 4(%esp), %xmm0. ; COM: FIXME: X64 isn't working correctly yet for this part of codegen, but; ; COM: X64 will have something similar to X32:; ; COM:; ; COM: X64: pinsrd_1:; ; COM: X64: pinsrd $1, %edi, %xmm0. Without ""``COM:``"", you would need to use some combination of rewording and; directive syntax mangling to prevent FileCheck from recognizing the commented; occurrences of ""``X32:``"" and ""``X64:``"" above as directives.

Testability,". LLVM's ""eager"" JIT compiler is safe to use in threaded programs. Multiple; threads can call ``ExecutionEngine::getPointerToFunction()`` or; ``ExecutionEngine::runFunction()`` concurrently, and multiple threads can run; code output by the JIT concurrently. The user must still ensure that only one; thread accesses IR in a given ``LLVMContext`` while another thread might be; modifying it. One way to do that is to always hold the JIT lock while accessing; IR outside the JIT (the JIT *modifies* the IR by adding ``CallbackVH``\ s).; Another way is to only call ``getPointerToFunction()`` from the; ``LLVMContext``'s thread. When the JIT is configured to compile lazily (using; ``ExecutionEngine::DisableLazyCompilation(false)``), there is currently a `race; condition <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5184>`_ in updating call sites; after a function is lazily-jitted. It's still possible to use the lazy JIT in a; threaded program if you ensure that only one thread at a time can call any; particular lazy stub and that the JIT lock guards any IR access, but we suggest; using only the eager JIT in threaded programs. .. _advanced:.

Testability,". Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations.

While POST data in request used to transfer list of multiple requests, it is not possible to submit; such kind of requests, which themselves require data from POST block. To use `multi.json` request from the JavaScript, one should create special 'POST' HTTP request and properly parse it.

Testability,". RooFit. HistFactory. One of the core classes used by HistFactory models (RooRealSumPdf) was modified leading to substantial speed improvements (for models that use the default -standard_form option). . This new version supports a few types of interpolation for the normalization of the histograms:. code = 0: piece-wise linear (old default); code = 1: piece-wise log (new default); code = 2: parabolic interp with linear extrap ( common at tevatron, avoids kink for asymmetric uncert). The piece-wise logarithmic interpolation paired with a Gaussian constraint is equivalent to a log-normal constraint in a transformed version of the nuisance parameter. The benefit of this approach is that it is easy to avoid the normalization from taking on unphysical negative values. This is the prescription used by the CMS Higgs group, and agreed upon by the LHC Higgs Combination Group.

Testability,". Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt.

Thanks to Arnaud Robert (LPNHE) for his; contributions.; ; ; Tree assignment to signal/background: Signal and; background trees can now be assigned individually to training; and test purposes. This is achieved by setting the third; parameter of the Factory::AddSignalTree/AddBackgroundTree(); methods to ""Train"" or ""Test"" (const string). The only; restriction is that either none or all signal (background); trees need to be specified with that option. It is possible to; mix the two modes, for instance one can assign individual; training and test trees for signal, but not for background.; ; Direct tree building: For increased flexibility,; users can also directly input signal and background,; training and test events to TMVA, instead of letting TMVA; interpret user-given trees.

Variable transformations can now be applied to a user-defined subset; of variables (and regression targets).; Enable variable transformations for general boosting; Extended PDEFoam functionality:. Multiclass classification by training of one discriminator foam for each; variable.; The cell tree can now be plotted from the macro test/PlotFoams. This makes; it easyer to compare the PDEFoam structure to a decision tree.; Variable importance ranking by counting the number of cuts made in each; dimension. The variable, for which the most cuts were done is ranked highest. Fixed the size of the sampling box in PDEFoam:; In TMVA 4.1.0 the size of the PDEFoam sampling box in each dimension was; 2*VolFrac times the foam size. This was contrary to the intention and the; documentation in the UserGuide and is now corrected: In TMVA 4.1.1 the size; of the PDEFoam sampling box in each dimension is now VolFrac times the foam; size. This implies that in TMVA 4.1.1 the VolFrac value for training a PDEFoam; must be doubled in order to give the same results as in TMVA 4.1.0. The default; VolFrac value was also changed from 0.0333 to 0.0666.; New configuration variable ""NbinsMVAoutput"" defining the bins of the MVA output; variables in the TMVA training plots produced via the GUI.

Requested number of training and testing events was not; correct when pre-selection cuts were applied.

Testability,". The contextual elements themselves do not necessarily need to be presented in; human-readable output. However, the information they impart may be essential to; understanding the logging text even after symbolization. So it's recommended; that this information be preserved in some form when the original raw log with; markup may no longer be readily accessible for whatever reason. Contextual elements should appear in the logging stream before they are needed.; That is, if some piece of context may affect how the symbolizing filter would; interpret or present a later presentation element, the necessary contextual; elements should have appeared somewhere earlier in the logging stream. It should; always be possible for the symbolizing filter to be implemented as a single pass; over the raw logging stream, accumulating context and massaging text as it goes. ``{{{reset}}}``. This should be output before any other contextual element. The need for this; contextual element is to support implementations that handle logs coming from; multiple processes. Such implementations might not know when a new process; starts or ends. Because some identifying information (like process IDs) might; be the same between old and new processes, a way is needed to distinguish two; processes with such identical identifying information. This element informs; such implementations to reset the state of a filter so that information from a; previous process's contextual elements is not assumed for new process that; just happens have the same identifying information. ``{{{module:%i:%s:%s:...}}}``. This element represents a so-called ""module"". A ""module"" is a single linked; binary, such as a loaded ELF file. Usually each module occupies a contiguous; range of memory. Here ``%i`` is the module ID which is used by other contextual elements to; refer to this module. The first ``%s`` is a human-readable identifier for the; module, such as an ELF ``DT_SONAME`` string or a file name; but it might be; empty.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:18392,log,logs,18392,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['log'],['logs']

Testability,". The time will depend on the size; and complexity of the component, so adding release and testing managers on the; RFC and review is strongly advisable. Deprecation Policy; ==================. The LLVM code base has a number of files that aren't being actively maintained.; But not all of those files are obstructing the development of the project and; so it remains in the repository with the assumption that it could still be; useful for downstream users. For code to remain in the repository, its presence must not impose an undue; burden on maintaining other components (core or peripheral). Warnings; --------. There are multiple types of issues that might trigger a request for deprecation,; including (but not limited to):. * Changes in a component consistently break other areas of the project.; * Components go broken for long periods of time (weeks or more).; * Clearly superior alternatives are in use and maintenance is painful.; * Builds and tests are harder / take longer, increasing the cost of; maintenance, overtaking the perceived benefits. If the maintenance cost is higher than it is acceptable by the majority of; developers, it means that either the sub-community is too small (and the extra; cost should be paid locally), or not active enough (and the problems won't be; fixed any time soon). In either case, removal of such problematic component is; justified. Steps for removal; -----------------. However clear the needs for removal are, we should take an incremental approach; to deprecating code, especially when there's still a sub-community that cares; about it. In that sense, code will never be removed outright without a series; of steps are taken. A minimum set of steps should be:; #. A proposal for removal / deactivation should be made to the Discourse forums ; (under the appropriate category), with a clear; statement of the maintenance costs imposed and the alternatives, if; applicable.; #.

Testability,". _limitations:. Limitations; -----------. Currently the MIR format has several limitations in terms of which state it; can serialize:. - The target-specific state in the target-specific ``MachineFunctionInfo``; subclasses isn't serialized at the moment. - The target-specific ``MachineConstantPoolValue`` subclasses (in the ARM and; SystemZ backends) aren't serialized at the moment. - The ``MCSymbol`` machine operands don't support temporary or local symbols. - A lot of the state in ``MachineModuleInfo`` isn't serialized - only the CFI; instructions and the variable debug information from MMI is serialized right; now. These limitations impose restrictions on what you can test with the MIR format.; For now, tests that would like to test some behaviour that depends on the state; of temporary or local ``MCSymbol`` operands or the exception handling state in; MMI, can't use the MIR format. As well as that, tests that test some behaviour; that depends on the state of the target specific ``MachineFunctionInfo`` or; ``MachineConstantPoolValue`` subclasses can't use the MIR format at the moment.

The reexports utility can be handy for composing a single JITDylib interface by; re-exporting symbols from several other JITDylibs. .. _Laziness:. Laziness; ========. Laziness in ORC is provided by a utility called ""lazy reexports"". A lazy; reexport is similar to a regular reexport or alias: It provides a new name for; an existing symbol. Unlike regular reexports however, lookups of lazy reexports; do not trigger immediate materialization of the reexported symbol. Instead, they; only trigger materialization of a function stub. This function stub is; initialized to point at a *lazy call-through*, which provides reentry into the; JIT. If the stub is called at runtime then the lazy call-through will look up; the reexported symbol (triggering materialization for it if necessary), update; the stub (to call directly to the reexported symbol on subsequent calls), and; then return via the reexported symbol. By re-using the existing symbol lookup; mechanism, lazy reexports inherit the same concurrency guarantees: calls to lazy; reexports can be made from multiple threads concurrently, and the reexported; symbol can be any state of compilation (uncompiled, already in the process of; being compiled, or already compiled) and the call will succeed. This allows; laziness to be safely mixed with features like remote compilation, concurrent; compilation, concurrent JIT'd code, and speculative compilation. There is one other key difference between regular reexports and lazy reexports; that some clients must be aware of: The address of a lazy reexport will be; *different* from the address of the reexported symbol (whereas a regular; reexport is guaranteed to have the same address as the reexported symbol).; Clients who care about pointer equality will generally wa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:17066,stub,stub,17066,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,2,['stub'],['stub']

It documents the structure of the LLVM testing; infrastructure, the tools needed to use it, and how to add and run; tests. Requirements; ============. In order to use the LLVM testing infrastructure, you will need all of the; software required to build LLVM, as well as `Python <http://python.org>`_ 3.6 or; later. LLVM Testing Infrastructure Organization; ========================================. The LLVM testing infrastructure contains three major categories of tests:; unit tests, regression tests and whole programs. The unit tests and regression; tests are contained inside the LLVM repository itself under ``llvm/unittests``; and ``llvm/test`` respectively and are expected to always pass -- they should be; run before every commit. The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR.

The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be benchmarked marks the register as requiring a definition.; A value will automatically be provided unless a second parameter, a hex value,; is passed in.

If it is a; value smaller than the register, it is sign extended to match the size of the; register.; * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN <register name>` - This annotation allows specifying; registers that should keep their value upon starting the benchmark.

Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions. It means exactly what its name implies: a function; with a 'noreturn' attribute should never return.; Specific details of the syntax of using the 'noreturn' attribute can be found; in GCC's; documentation.; Not only does the analyzer exploit this information when pruning false paths,; but the compiler also takes it seriously and will generate different code (and; possibly better optimized) under the assumption that the function does not; return.; Example; On Mac OS X, the function prototype for __assert_rtn (declared in; assert.h) is specifically annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute:. void __assert_rtn(const char *, const char *, int, const char *) __attribute__((__noreturn__));. Attribute 'analyzer_noreturn' (Clang-specific); The Clang-specific 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute is almost identical to; 'noreturn' except that it is ignored by the compiler for the purposes of code; generation.; This attribute is useful for annotating assertion handlers that actually; can return, but for the purpose of using the analyzer we want to; pretend that such functions do not return.; Because this attribute is Clang-specific, its use should be conditioned with; the use of preprocessor macros.; Example. #ifndef CLANG_ANALYZER_NORETURN; #if __has_feature(attribute_analyzer_noreturn); #define CLANG_ANALYZER_NORETURN __attribute__((analyzer_noreturn)); #else; #define CLANG_ANALYZER_NORETURN; #endif; #endif. void my_assert_rtn(const char *, const char *, int, const char *) CLANG_ANALYZ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:22489,assert,assert,22489,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,2,['assert'],['assert']

Testability,".. _classes:. Classes; =======. Both Python and C++ support object-oriented code through classes and thus; it is logical to expose C++ classes as Python ones, including the full; inheritance hierarchy. The C++ code used for the examples below can be found; :doc:`here <cppyy_features_header>`, and it is assumed that that code is; loaded at the start of any session.; Download it, save it under the name ``features.h``, and load it:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('features.h'); >>>. `Basics`; --------. All bound C++ code starts off from the global C++ namespace, represented in; Python by ``gbl``.; This namespace, as any other namespace, is treated as a module after it has; been loaded.; Thus, we can import C++ classes that live underneath it:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Concrete; >>> Concrete; <class cppyy.gbl.Concrete at 0x2058e30>; >>>. Placing classes in the same structure as imposed by C++ guarantees identity,; even if multiple Python modules bind the same class.; There is, however, no necessity to expose that structure to end-users: when; developing a Python package that exposes C++ classes through ``cppyy``,; consider ``cppyy.gbl`` an ""internal"" module, and expose the classes in any; structure you see fit.; The C++ names will continue to follow the C++ structure, however, as is needed; for e.g. pickling:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Namespace; >>> Concrete == Namespace.Concrete; False; >>> n = Namespace.Concrete.NestedClass(); >>> type(n); <class cppyy.gbl.Namespace.Concrete.NestedClass at 0x22114c0>; >>> type(n).__name__; NestedClass; >>> type(n).__module__; cppyy.gbl.Namespace.Concrete; >>> type(n).__cpp_name__; Namespace::Concrete::NestedClass; >>>. `Constructors`; --------------.

Testability,".. _cuda:. CUDA support; ============. .. warning::. This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.3.0.; It is still incomplete and has only been tested on Linux on x86_64. CUDA is supported by passing all JITed code through two pipelines: one for the; CPU and one for the GPU.; Use of the ``__CUDA__`` pre-processor macro enables more fine-grained control; over which pipeline sees what, which is used e.g. in the pre-compiled header:; the GPU pipeline has the CUDA headers included, the CPU pipeline does not.; Building the pre-compiled header will also pick up common CUDA libraries such; as cuBLAS, if installed. Each version of CUDA requires specific versions of Clang and the system; compiler (e.g. gcc) for proper functioning; it's therefore best to build the; backend (``cppyy-cling``) from source for the specific combination of; interest.; The 3.x series of cppyy uses Clang13, the 2.x series Clang9, and this may; limit the CUDA versions supported (especially since CUDA has changed the APIs; for launching kernels in v11). There are three environment variables to control Cling's handling of CUDA:. * ``CLING_ENABLE_CUDA`` (required): set to ``1`` to enable the CUDA; backend. * ``CLING_CUDA_PATH`` (optional): set to the local CUDA installation if not; in a standard location. * ``CLING_CUDA_ARCH`` (optional): set the architecture to target; default is; ``sm_35`` (Clang9 is limited to ``sm_75``).

This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.4.0.; It is still incomplete (see listing below) and has only been tested on; Linux on x86_64. Numba `is a JIT compiler`_ for Python functions that can be statically typed; based on their input arguments.; Since C++ objects are always statically typed and already implemented at the; machine level, they can be dynamically integrated into the Numba type tracing; and lowering by exposing type details through C++ reflection at runtime. JIT-compiling traces of mixed Python/bound C++ code reduces, and in some; cases removes, the overhead of boxing/unboxing native data into their Python; proxies and vice versa.; It can also reduce or remove temporaries, especially for template; expressions.; Thus, there can be significant speedups for mixed code, beyond the Numba; compilation of Python code itself.; The current implementation integrates compiled C++ through function pointers,; object pointers, and pointer offsets, into the intermediate representation; (IR) as generated by Numba.; A future version may integrate Cling-generated IR directly into Numba IR (or; vice versa), e.g. if the C++ code is exposed from (precompiled) headers.; This would allow inlining of C++ code into Numba traces, for further; expected speedups. Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; woul",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:195,test,tested,195,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,".; =tag: Debug information tags. **Note:** For ELF format, the collected tags represent the debug tags; that are not processed. For PE/COFF format, they represent the tags; that are processed. EXAMPLES; --------; This section includes some real binary files to show how to use; :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` to print a logical view and to; diagnose possible debug information issues. TEST CASE 1 - GENERAL OPTIONS; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; The below example is used to show different output generated by; :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer`. We compiled the example for an X86; ELF target with Clang (-O0 -g):. .. code-block:: c++. 1 using INTPTR = const int *;; 2 int foo(INTPTR ParamPtr, unsigned ParamUnsigned, bool ParamBool) {; 3 if (ParamBool) {; 4 typedef int INTEGER;; 5 const INTEGER CONSTANT = 7;; 6 return CONSTANT;; 7 }; 8 return ParamUnsigned;; 9 }. PRINTING MODE; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^; In this mode :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` prints the *logical view*; or portions of it, based on criteria patterns (including regular; expressions) to select the kind of *logical elements* to be included in; the output. BASIC DETAILS; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; The following command prints basic details for all the logical elements; sorted by the debug information internal offset; it includes its lexical; level and debug info format. .. code-block:: none. llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level,format; --output-sort=offset; --print=scopes,symbols,types,lines,instructions; test-dwarf-clang.o. or. .. code-block:: none. llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level,format; --output-sort=offset; --print=elements; test-dwarf-clang.o. Each row represents an element that is present within the debug; information. The first column represents the scope level, followed by; the associated line number (if any), and finally the description of; the element. .. code-block:: none.

Testability,".; Also show a progress bar, unless ``--no-progress-bar`` is specified. .. option:: -v, --verbose. Show more information on test failures, for example the entire test output; instead of just the test result. Each command is printed before it is executed. This can be valuable for; debugging test failures, as the last printed command is the one that failed.; Moreover, :program:`lit` inserts ``'RUN: at line N'`` before each; command pipeline in the output to help you locate the source line of; the failed command. .. option:: -vv, --echo-all-commands. Deprecated alias for -v. .. option:: -a, --show-all. Enable -v, but for all tests not just failed tests. .. option:: --no-progress-bar. Do not use curses based progress bar. .. option:: --show-unsupported. Show the names of unsupported tests. .. option:: --show-xfail. Show the names of tests that were expected to fail. .. _execution-options:. EXECUTION OPTIONS; -----------------. .. option:: --path=PATH. Specify an additional ``PATH`` to use when searching for executables in tests. .. option:: --vg. Run individual tests under valgrind (using the memcheck tool). The; ``--error-exitcode`` argument for valgrind is used so that valgrind failures; will cause the program to exit with a non-zero status. When this option is enabled, :program:`lit` will also automatically provide a; ""``valgrind``"" feature that can be used to conditionally disable (or expect; failure in) certain tests. .. option:: --vg-arg=ARG. When :option:`--vg` is used, specify an additional argument to pass to; :program:`valgrind` itself. .. option:: --vg-leak. When :option:`--vg` is used, enable memory leak checks. When this option is; enabled, :program:`lit` will also automatically provide a ""``vg_leak``""; feature that can be used to conditionally disable (or expect failure in); certain tests. .. option:: --time-tests.

Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------.

Contains subdirectories which entire programs with multiple source files.; Large benchmarks and whole applications go here. - `MicroBenchmarks/`.

The programs define functions that are run multiple times until the; measurement results are statistically significant. - `External/`.

LNT is a set of client and server tools for continuously monitoring; performance. You can find more information at; [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt). The official LNT instance; of the LLVM project is hosted at [http://lnt.llvm.org](http://lnt.llvm.org). External Suites; ---------------. External suites such as SPEC can be enabled by either. - placing (or linking) them into the `test-suite/test-suite-externals/xxx` directory (example: `test-suite/test-suite-externals/speccpu2000`); - using a configuration option such as `-D TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT=path/to/speccpu2000`. You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```.

A program is ill-formed if it contains a method definition, message send, or; ``@selector`` expression for any of the following selectors:. * ``autorelease``; * ``release``; * ``retain``; * ``retainCount``. .. admonition:: Rationale. ``retainCount`` is banned because ARC robs it of consistent semantics. The; others were banned after weighing three options for how to deal with message; sends:. **Honoring** them would work out very poorly if a programmer naively or; accidentally tried to incorporate code written for manual retain/release code; into an ARC program. At best, such code would do twice as much work as; necessary; quite frequently, however, ARC and the explicit code would both; try to balance the same retain, leading to crashes. The cost is losing the; ability to perform ""unrooted"" retains, i.e. retains not logically; corresponding to a strong reference in the object graph. **Ignoring** them would badly violate user expectations about their code.; While it *would* make it easier to develop code simultaneously for ARC and; non-ARC, there is very little reason to do so except for certain library; developers. ARC and non-ARC translation units share an execution model and; can seamlessly interoperate. Within a translation unit, a developer who; faithfully maintains their code in non-ARC mode is suffering all the; restrictions of ARC for zero benefit, while a developer who isn't testing the; non-ARC mode is likely to be unpleasantly surprised if they try to go back to; it. **Banning** them has the disadvantage of making it very awkward to migrate; existing code to ARC. The best answer to that, given a number of other; changes and restrictions in ARC, is to provide a specialized tool to assist; users in that migration. Implementing these methods was banned because they are too integral to the; semantics of ARC; many tric",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:85943,log,logically,85943,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['log'],['logically']

Testability,"// top doc Doxygen page for minuit2. /**. \page Minuit2Page Minuit2. The Minuit2 library is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of the popular MINUIT minimization package.; These new version provides basically all the functionality present in the old Fortran version,; with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and computational performances.; Furthermore, it contains new functionality, like the possibility to set single side parameter limits or; the FUMILI algorithm, which is an optimized method for least square and log likelihood minimizations.; The package has been originally developed by M. Winkler and F. James.; More information on the new C++ version can be found on the; MINUIT Web Site. Minuit2, originally developed in the SEAL project, is now distributed within %ROOT.; The API has been then changed in this new version to follow the %ROOT coding convention (function names starting with capital letters) and the classes have been moved inside the namespace ROOT::Minuit2.; In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements the interface; ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2. An example of using this interface is; the %ROOT tutorial tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C or; the Minuit2 test program testMinimize.cxx. A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be downloaded from here. It does not contain the %ROOT interface and it is therefore totally independent of external packages and can be simply build using the configure script and then make. Example tests are provided in the directory test/MnSim and test/MnTutorial and they can be built with the make check command. The Minuit2 User Guide provides all the information needed for using directly (without add-on packages like ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/doc/Minuit2.html:539,log,log,539,math/minuit2/doc/Minuit2.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/doc/Minuit2.html,2,['log'],['log']

For example:. ``` {.cpp}; myHisto->Fit(""gaus""); ```. The call to Fit copies the global **`TF1`** Gaussian function and; attaches the copy to the histogram. When the histogram is deleted, the; copy is deleted also. When a pad is deleted or cleared, all objects in the pad with the; `kCanDelete` bit set are deleted automatically. Currently the objects; created by the `DrawCopy` methods, have the `kCanDelete` bit set and; are therefore owned by the pad. ## Ownership by the User. The user owns all objects not described in one of the above cases.; **`TObject`** has two bits, `kCanDelete` and `kMustCleanup`, that; influence how an object is managed (in `TObject::fBits)`. These are in; an enumeration in `TObject.h.` To set these bits do:. ``` {.cpp}; MyObject->SetBit(kCanDelete); MyObject->SetBit(kMustCleanup); ```. The bits can be reset and tested with the `TObject::ResetBit` and; **`TObject::TestBit` methods.**. ### The kCanDelete Bit. The ***`gROOT`*** collections (see above) own their members and will; delete them regardless of the `kCanDelete` bit. In all other; collections, when the collection `Clear` method is called (i.e.; **`TList::Clear())`**, members with the `kCanDelete` bit set, are; deleted and removed from the collection. If the `kCanDelete` bit is; not set, the object is only removed from the collection but not; deleted. If a collection `Delete` (`TList::Delete()`) method is called, all; objects in the collection are deleted without considering the; `kCanDelete` bit. It is important to realize that deleting the; collection (i.e. delete `MyCollection`), DOES NOT delete the members; of the collection. If the user specified `MyCollection->SetOwner()` the collection owns; the objects and delete `MyCollection` will delete all its members.; Otherwise, you need to:. ``` {.cpp}; // delete all member objects in the collection; MyCollecti",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/ObjectOwnership.md:5550,test,tested,5550,documentation/users-guide/ObjectOwnership.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/ObjectOwnership.md,1,['test'],['tested']

Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file.

For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory.

If you want to run under a debugger, you should use the default Debug; (which is totally unoptimized, and will lead to >10x slower test; runs) or RelWithDebInfo which is a halfway point.; **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** affects code generation only, assertions are; on by default regardless! **LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=Off** disables; them. - **LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang**: this lists the LLVM subprojects; you are interested in building, in addition to LLVM itself. Multiple; projects can be listed, separated by semicolons, such as ""clang;; lldb"".In this example, we'll be making a change to Clang, so we; should build it.

The disabled; tests either run for a very short time or are dominated by I/O performance; making them unsuitable as compiler performance tests. - `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS`. Semicolon-separated list of directories to include. This can be used to only; build parts of the test-suite or to include external suites. This option; does not work reliably with deeper subdirectories as it skips intermediate; `CMakeLists.txt` files which may be required. - `TEST_SUITE_COLLECT_STATS`. Collect internal LLVM statistics.

If this is set to `OFF` then lit will not actually run the tests but just; collect build statistics like compile time and code size. - `TEST_SUITE_USE_PERF`.

Testability,"/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------. The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. The test suite contains tests to check quality of debugging information.; The test are written in C based languages or in LLVM assembly language. These tests are compiled and run under a debugger. The debugger output; is checked to validate of debugging information. See README.txt in the; test suite for more information. This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:4000,test,test-suite,4000,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test-suite']
Testability,"/lnt](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt). The official LNT instance; of the LLVM project is hosted at [http://lnt.llvm.org](http://lnt.llvm.org). External Suites; ---------------. External suites such as SPEC can be enabled by either. - placing (or linking) them into the `test-suite/test-suite-externals/xxx` directory (example: `test-suite/test-suite-externals/speccpu2000`); - using a configuration option such as `-D TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT=path/to/speccpu2000`. You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```.

The **Total Time** is the real time in seconds to run the program.; **Effective time** is the real time minus the time spent in non I/O; operations (essentially the random number generator). The program; `Event` generates in average 600 tracks per event. Each track has 17; data members. The read benchmark runs in the interactive version of; ROOT. The ‘Total Time to Read All' is the real time reported by the; execution of the script `&ROOTSYS/test/eventa`. We did not correct this time for the overhead coming from the; interpreter itself. The **Total time to read sample** is the execution; time of the script `$ROOTSYS/test/eventb`. This script loops on all; events. For each event, the branch containing the number of tracks is; read. In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1.
