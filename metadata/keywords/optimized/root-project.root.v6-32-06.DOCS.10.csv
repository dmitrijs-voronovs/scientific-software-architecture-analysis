Integrability,"=======; Modules; =======. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============; Most software is built using a number of software libraries, including libraries supplied by the platform, internal libraries built as part of the software itself to provide structure, and third-party libraries. For each library, one needs to access both its interface (API) and its implementation. In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):. .. code-block:: c. #include <SomeLib.h>. The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker. Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library. Problems with the current model; -------------------------------; The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:. * **Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the; compiler must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every; header it includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion. If any of the; active macro definitions happens to collide with a name in the; library, it can b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:338,interface,interface,338,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,2,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"========; 0 Generic; 1 Global; 2 Internal Use; 3 Shared; 4 Constant; 5 Local; ============= ======================. Every global variable and pointer type is assigned to one of these address; spaces, with 0 being the default address space. Intrinsics are provided which; can be used to convert pointers between the generic and non-generic address; spaces. As an example, the following IR will define an array ``@g`` that resides in; global device memory. .. code-block:: llvm. @g = internal addrspace(1) global [4 x i32] [ i32 0, i32 1, i32 2, i32 3 ]. LLVM IR functions can read and write to this array, and host-side code can; copy data to it by name with the CUDA Driver API. Note that since address space 0 is the generic space, it is illegal to have; global variables in address space 0. Address space 0 is the default address; space in LLVM, so the ``addrspace(N)`` annotation is *required* for global; variables. Triples; -------. The NVPTX target uses the module triple to select between 32/64-bit code; generation and the driver-compiler interface to use. The triple architecture; can be one of ``nvptx`` (32-bit PTX) or ``nvptx64`` (64-bit PTX). The; operating system should be one of ``cuda`` or ``nvcl``, which determines the; interface used by the generated code to communicate with the driver. Most; users will want to use ``cuda`` as the operating system, which makes the; generated PTX compatible with the CUDA Driver API. Example: 32-bit PTX for CUDA Driver API: ``nvptx-nvidia-cuda``. Example: 64-bit PTX for CUDA Driver API: ``nvptx64-nvidia-cuda``. .. _nvptx_intrinsics:. NVPTX Intrinsics; ================. Address Space Conversion; ------------------------.

Integrability,"========; GWP-ASan; ========. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 2. Introduction; ============. GWP-ASan is a sampled allocator framework that assists in finding use-after-free; and heap-buffer-overflow bugs in production environments. It informally is a; recursive acronym, ""**G**\WP-ASan **W**\ill **P**\rovide **A**\llocation; **SAN**\ity"". GWP-ASan is based on the classic; `Electric Fence Malloc Debugger <https://linux.die.net/man/3/efence>`_, with a; key adaptation. Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_.

This documents describes the LibFormat interface and design as well; as some basic style discussions. If you just want to use `clang-format` as a tool or integrated into an editor,; checkout :doc:`ClangFormat`. Design; ------. FIXME: Write up design. Interface; ---------. The core routine of LibFormat is ``reformat()``:. .. code-block:: c++. tooling::Replacements reformat(const FormatStyle &Style, Lexer &Lex,; SourceManager &SourceMgr,; std::vector<CharSourceRange> Ranges);. This reads a token stream out of the lexer ``Lex`` and reformats all the code; ranges in ``Ranges``. The ``FormatStyle`` controls basic decisions made during; formatting. A list of options can be found under :ref:`style-options`. The style options are described in :doc:`ClangFormatStyleOptions`. .. _style-options:. Style Options; -------------. The style options describe specific formatting options that can be used in; order to make `ClangFormat` comply with different style guides. Currently,; several style guides are hard-coded:. .. code-block:: c++. /// Returns a format style complying with the LLVM coding standards:; /// https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html.; FormatStyle getLLVMStyle();. /// Returns a format style complying with Google's C++ style guide:; /// http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml.; FormatStyle getGoogleStyle();. /// Returns a format style complying with Chromium's style guide:; /// https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/styleguide/styleguide.md; FormatStyle getChromiumStyle();. /// Returns a format style complying with the GNU coding standards:; /// https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html; FormatStyle getGNUStyle();. /// Returns a format style complying with Mozilla's style guide; /// https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/index.html; FormatStyle getMozillaStyle();",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibFormat.rst:161,interface,interface,161,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibFormat.rst,3,"['integrat', 'interface', 'rout']","['integrated', 'interface', 'routine']"
Integrability,"==========. Because changing PSTATE.SM zeroes the FP/vector registers, it is best to emit; the ``smstart`` and ``smstop`` instructions before register allocation, so that; the register allocator can spill/reload registers around the mode change. The compiler should also have sufficient information on which operations are; part of the call/function's arguments/result and which operations are part of; the function's body, so that it can place the mode changes in exactly the right; position. The suitable place to do this seems to be SelectionDAG, where it lowers; the call's arguments/return values to implement the specified calling convention.; SelectionDAG provides Chains and Glue to specify the order of operations and give; preliminary control over the instruction's scheduling. Example of preserving state; ---------------------------. When passing and returning a ``float`` value to/from a function; that has a streaming interface from a function that has a normal interface, the; call-site will need to ensure that the argument/result registers are preserved; and that no other code is scheduled in between the ``smstart/smstop`` and the call. .. code-block:: llvm. define float @foo(float %f) nounwind {; %res = call float @bar(float %f) ""aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled""; ret float %res; }. declare float @bar(float) ""aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled"".

Integrability,"==========. First, you should pick a collector strategy. LLVM includes a number of built; in ones, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to know about) in your generated IR, so that LLVM can encode them into; your final stack maps. Depending on the collector strategy chosen, this is; accomplished by using either the ``@llvm.gcroot`` intrinsics or an; ``gc.statepoint`` relocation sequence. Don't forget to create a root for each intermediate value that is generated when; evaluating an expression.

Integrability,"============. Alias Analysis (aka Pointer Analysis) is a class of techniques which attempt to; determine whether or not two pointers ever can point to the same object in; memory. There are many different algorithms for alias analysis and many; different ways of classifying them: flow-sensitive vs. flow-insensitive,; context-sensitive vs. context-insensitive, field-sensitive; vs. field-insensitive, unification-based vs. subset-based, etc. Traditionally,; alias analyses respond to a query with a `Must, May, or No`_ alias response,; indicating that two pointers always point to the same object, might point to the; same object, or are known to never point to the same object. The LLVM `AliasAnalysis; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__ class is the; primary interface used by clients and implementations of alias analyses in the; LLVM system. This class is the common interface between clients of alias; analysis information and the implementations providing it, and is designed to; support a wide range of implementations and clients (but currently all clients; are assumed to be flow-insensitive).

Integrability,"===============. Introduction; ============. Three new features were introduced into clang at the same time:; *NSNumber Literals* provide a syntax for creating ``NSNumber`` from; scalar literal expressions; *Collection Literals* provide a short-hand; for creating arrays and dictionaries; *Object Subscripting* provides a; way to use subscripting with Objective-C objects. Users of Apple; compiler releases can use these features starting with the Apple LLVM; Compiler 4.0. Users of open-source LLVM.org compiler releases can use; these features starting with clang v3.1. These language additions simplify common Objective-C programming; patterns, make programs more concise, and improve the safety of; container creation. This document describes how the features are implemented in clang, and; how to use them in your own programs. NSNumber Literals; =================. The framework class ``NSNumber`` is used to wrap scalar values inside; objects: signed and unsigned integers (``char``, ``short``, ``int``,; ``long``, ``long long``), floating point numbers (``float``,; ``double``), and boolean values (``BOOL``, C++ ``bool``). Scalar values; wrapped in objects are also known as *boxed* values. In Objective-C, any character, numeric or boolean literal prefixed with; the ``'@'`` character will evaluate to a pointer to an ``NSNumber``; object initialized with that value. C's type suffixes may be used to; control the size of numeric literals. Examples; --------. The following program illustrates the rules for ``NSNumber`` literals:. .. code-block:: objc. void main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {; // character literals.; NSNumber *theLetterZ = @'Z'; // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithChar:'Z']. // integral literals.; NSNumber *fortyTwo = @42; // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithInt:42]; NSNumber *fortyTwoUnsigned = @42U; // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInt:42U]; NSNumber *fortyTwoLong = @42L; // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithLong:42L]; NSNumber *fortyTwoLongLong = ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst:964,wrap,wrap,964,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrap']
Integrability,"===============; Support Library; ===============. Abstract; ========. This document provides some details on LLVM's Support Library, located in the; source at ``lib/Support`` and ``include/llvm/Support``. The library's purpose; is to shield LLVM from the differences between operating systems for the few; services LLVM needs from the operating system. Much of LLVM is written using; portability features of standard C++. However, in a few areas, system dependent; facilities are needed and the Support Library is the wrapper around those; system calls. By centralizing LLVM's use of operating system interfaces, we make it possible; for the LLVM tool chain and runtime libraries to be more easily ported to new; platforms since (theoretically) only ``lib/Support`` needs to be ported. This; library also unclutters the rest of LLVM from #ifdef use and special cases for; specific operating systems. Such uses are replaced with simple calls to the; interfaces provided in ``include/llvm/Support``. Note that the Support Library is not intended to be a complete operating system; wrapper (such as the Adaptive Communications Environment (ACE) or Apache; Portable Runtime (APR)), but only provides the functionality necessary to; support LLVM. The Support Library was originally referred to as the System Library, written; by Reid Spencer who formulated the design based on similar work originating; from the eXtensible Programming System (XPS). Several people helped with the; effort; especially, Jeff Cohen and Henrik Bach on the Win32 port. Keeping LLVM Portable; =====================. In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective.

Integrability,"===============; The LLVM gold plugin; ====================. Introduction; ============. Building with link time optimization requires cooperation from; the system linker. LTO support on Linux systems is available via the; `gold linker`_ which supports LTO via plugins. This is the same mechanism; used by the `GCC LTO`_ project. The LLVM gold plugin implements the gold plugin interface on top of; :ref:`libLTO`. The same plugin can also be used by other tools such as; ``ar`` and ``nm``. Note that ld.bfd from binutils version 2.21.51.0.2; and above also supports LTO via plugins.

TableGen is used by both LLVM, Clang, and MLIR with very different goals.; LLVM uses it as a way to automate the generation of massive amounts of; information regarding instructions, schedules, cores, and architecture; features. Some backends generate output that is consumed by more than one; source file, so they need to be created in a way that makes it is easy for; preprocessor tricks to be used. Some backends can also print C++ code; structures, so that they can be directly included as-is.

The LLVM pass framework is an important part of the LLVM system, because LLVM; passes are where most of the interesting parts of the compiler exist. Passes; perform the transformations and optimizations that make up the compiler, they; build the analysis results that are used by these transformations, and they; are, above all, a structuring technique for compiler code. Unlike passes under the legacy pass manager where the pass interface is; defined via inheritance, passes under the new pass manager rely on; concept-based polymorphism, meaning there is no explicit interface (see; comments in ``PassManager.h`` for more details). All LLVM passes inherit from; the CRTP mix-in ``PassInfoMixin<PassT>``. The pass should have a ``run()``; method which returns a ``PreservedAnalyses`` and takes in some unit of IR; along with an analysis manager. For example, a function pass would have a; ``PreservedAnalyses run(Function &F, FunctionAnalysisManager &AM);`` method. We start by showing you how to construct a pass, from setting up the build,; creating the pass, to executing and testing it. Looking at existing passes is; always a great way to learn details. .. warning::; This document deals with the new pass manager. LLVM uses the legacy pass; manager for the codegen pipeline.

Integrability,"=====================; Debugging JIT-ed Code; =====================. Background; ==========. Without special runtime support, debugging dynamically generated code can be; quite painful. Debuggers generally read debug information from object files on; disk, but for JITed code there is no such file to look for. In order to hand over the necessary debug info, `GDB established an; interface <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html>`_; for registering JITed code with debuggers. LLDB implements it in the; JITLoaderGDB plugin. On the JIT side, LLVM MCJIT does implement the interface; for ELF object files. At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine code, it does so in an; in-memory object file that contains the debug information in DWARF format.; MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to a global list of dynamically; generated object files and calls a special function; ``__jit_debug_register_code`` that the debugger knows about. When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on. On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================.

Integrability,"=====================; How To Use Attributes; =====================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. Attributes in LLVM have changed in some fundamental ways. It was necessary to; do this to support expanding the attributes to encompass more than a handful of; attributes --- e.g. command line options. The old way of handling attributes; consisted of representing them as a bit mask of values. This bit mask was; stored in a ""list"" structure that was reference counted. The advantage of this; was that attributes could be manipulated with 'or's and 'and's. The; disadvantage of this was that there was limited room for expansion, and; virtually no support for attribute-value pairs other than alignment. In the new scheme, an ``Attribute`` object represents a single attribute that's; uniqued. You use the ``Attribute::get`` methods to create a new ``Attribute``; object. An attribute can be a single ""enum"" value (the enum being the; ``Attribute::AttrKind`` enum), a string representing a target-dependent; attribute, or an attribute-value pair. Some examples:. * Target-independent: ``noinline``, ``zext``; * Target-dependent: ``""no-sse""``, ``""thumb2""``; * Attribute-value pair: ``""cpu"" = ""cortex-a8""``, ``align = 4``. Note: for an attribute value pair, we expect a target-dependent attribute to; have a string for the value. ``Attribute``; =============; An ``Attribute`` object is designed to be passed around by value. Because attributes are no longer represented as a bit mask, you will need to; convert any code which does treat them as a bit mask to use the new query; methods on the Attribute class. ``AttributeList``; =================. The ``AttributeList`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind of; object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as a whole,; the return type, or the function's parameters. A function's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::FunctionIndex``; the return type's attributes are at; index ``Attribut",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUseAttributes.rst:1018,depend,dependent,1018,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUseAttributes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUseAttributes.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Classes used to represent the `code being generated`_ for a target. These; classes are intended to be abstract enough to represent the machine code for; *any* target machine. These classes are defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/``. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" are explicitly exposed. 3. Classes and algorithms used to represent code at the object file level, the; `MC Layer`_. These classes represent assembly level constructs like labels,; sections, and instructions. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" don't exist. 4. `Target-independent algorithms`_ used to implement various phases of native; code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack frame representation,; etc).

Integrability,"======================; Matching the Clang AST; ======================. This document explains how to use Clang's LibASTMatchers to match interesting; nodes of the AST and execute code that uses the matched nodes. Combined with; :doc:`LibTooling`, LibASTMatchers helps to write code-to-code transformation; tools or query tools. We assume basic knowledge about the Clang AST. See the :doc:`Introduction; to the Clang AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>` if you want to learn more; about how the AST is structured. .. FIXME: create tutorial and link to the tutorial. Introduction; ------------. LibASTMatchers provides a domain specific language to create predicates on; Clang's AST. This DSL is written in and can be used from C++, allowing users; to write a single program to both match AST nodes and access the node's C++; interface to extract attributes, source locations, or any other information; provided on the AST level. AST matchers are predicates on nodes in the AST. Matchers are created by; calling creator functions that allow building up a tree of matchers, where; inner matchers are used to make the match more specific. For example, to create a matcher that matches all class or union declarations; in the AST of a translation unit, you can call `recordDecl(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#recordDecl0Anchor>`_. To narrow the match down,; for example to find all class or union declarations with the name ""``Foo``"",; insert a `hasName <LibASTMatchersReference.html#hasName0Anchor>`_ matcher: the; call ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""))`` returns a matcher that matches classes or; unions that are named ""``Foo``"", in any namespace. By default, matchers that; accept multiple inner matchers use an implicit `allOf(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#allOf0Anchor>`_. This allows further narrowing; down the match, for example to match all classes that are derived from; ""``Bar``"": ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""), isDerivedFrom(""Bar""))``.

Introduction; ============; Dependence graphs are useful tools in compilers for analyzing relationships; between various program elements to help guide optimizations. The ideas; behind these graphs are described in papers [1]_ and [2]_. The implementation of these ideas in LLVM may be slightly different than; what is mentioned in the papers. These differences are documented in; the `implementation details <implementation-details_>`_. .. _DataDependenceGraph:. Data Dependence Graph; =====================; In its simplest form the Data Dependence Graph (or DDG) represents data; dependencies between individual instructions. Each node in such a graph; represents a single instruction and is referred to as an ""atomic"" node.; It is also possible to combine some atomic nodes that have a simple; def-use dependency between them into larger nodes that contain multiple-; instructions. As described in [1]_ the DDG uses graph abstraction to group nodes; that are part of a strongly connected component of the graph; into special nodes called pi-blocks. pi-blocks represent cycles of data; dependency that prevent reordering transformations. Since any strongly; connected component of the graph is a maximal subgraph of all the nodes; that form a cycle, pi-blocks are at most one level deep. In other words,; no pi-blocks are nested inside another pi-block, resulting in a; hierarchical representation that is at most one level deep. For example, consider the following:. .. code-block:: c++. for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {; b[i] = c[i] + b[i-1];; }. This code contains a statement that has a loop carried dependence on; itself creating a cycle in the DDG.

The purpose of this document; is to describe both the motivation and design goals for the driver, as; well as details of the internal implementation. Features and Goals; ==================. The Clang driver is intended to be a production quality compiler driver; providing access to the Clang compiler and tools, with a command line; interface which is compatible with the gcc driver. Although the driver is part of and driven by the Clang project, it is; logically a separate tool which shares many of the same goals as Clang:. .. contents:: Features; :local:. GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:509,interface,interface,509,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"==========================; Symbolizer Markup Format; ==========================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. This document defines a text format for log messages that can be processed by a; symbolizing filter. The basic idea is that logging code emits text that contains; raw address values and so forth, without the logging code doing any real work to; convert those values to human-readable form. Instead, logging text uses the; markup format defined here to identify pieces of information that should be; converted to human-readable form after the fact. As with other markup formats,; the expectation is that most of the text will be displayed as is, while the; markup elements will be replaced with expanded text, or converted into active UI; elements, that present more details in symbolic form. This means there is no need for symbol tables, DWARF debugging sections, or; similar information to be directly accessible at runtime. There is also no need; at runtime for any logic intended to compute human-readable presentation of; information, such as C++ symbol demangling. Instead, logging must include markup; elements that give the contextual information necessary to make sense of the raw; data, such as memory layout details. This format identifies markup elements with a syntax that is both simple and; distinctive. It's simple enough to be matched and parsed with straightforward; code. It's distinctive enough that character sequences that look like the start; or end of a markup element should rarely if ever appear incidentally in logging; text. It's specifically intended not to require sanitizing plain text, such as; the HTML/XML requirement to replace ``<`` with ``&lt;`` and the like. :doc:`llvm-symbolizer <CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer>` includes a symbolizing; filter via its ``--filter-markup`` option.

Taint analysis works by checking for the occurrence of special operations during the symbolic execution of the program.; Taint analysis defines sources, sinks, and propagation rules.

Integrability,"=============================; LLVM Community Support Policy; =============================. As a compilation infrastructure, LLVM has multiple types of users, both; downstream and upstream, of many combinations of its projects, tools and; libraries. There is a core part of it that encompass the implementation of the compiler; (front/middle/back ends), run-time libraries (RT, C++, OpenMP, etc) and; associated tools (debugger, linker, object file manipulation, etc). These; components are present in the public release on our supported architectures; and operating systems and the whole community must maintain and care about. There are, however, other components within the main repository that either; cater to a specific sub-community of LLVM (upstream or downstream) or; help parts of the community to integrate LLVM into their own development tools; or external projects. Those parts of the main repository don't always have; rigorous testing like the core parts, nor are they validated and shipped with; our public upstream releases. Even not being a core part of the project, we have enough sub-communities; needing those changes with enough overlap that having them in the main; repository is beneficial to minimise the repetition of those changes in all; the external repositories that need them. But the maintenance costs of such diverse ecosystem is non trivial, so we divide; the level of support in two tiers: core and peripheral, with two; different levels of impact and responsibilities.

The RISC-V target provides code generation for processors implementing; supported variations of the RISC-V specification. It lives in the; ``llvm/lib/Target/RISCV`` directory. Specification Documents; =======================. There have been a number of revisions to the RISC-V specifications. LLVM aims; to implement the most recent ratified version of the standard RISC-V base ISAs; and ISA extensions with pragmatic variances. The most recent specification can; be found at: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/. `The official RISC-V International specification page; <https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/>`_. is also worth checking, but; tends to significantly lag the specifications linked above.

The current known variances from the specification are:. * Unconditionally allowing instructions from zifencei, zicsr, zicntr, and; zihpm without gating them on the extensions being enabled. Previous; revisions of the specification included these instructions in the base; ISA, and we preserve this behavior to avoid breaking existing code.

Some parallel execution environments execute threads in groups that allow; efficient communication within the group using special primitives called; *convergent* operations. The outcome of a convergent operation is sensitive to; the set of threads that executes it ""together"", i.e., convergently. When control; flow :ref:`diverges <convergence-and-uniformity>`, i.e. threads of the same; group follow different; paths through the CFG, not all threads of the group may be available to; participate in this communication. This is the defining characteristic that; distinguishes convergent operations from other inter-thread communication:. A convergent operation involves inter-thread communication or synchronization; that occurs outside of the memory model, where the set of threads which; participate in communication is implicitly affected by control flow. For example, in the following GPU compute kernel, communication during the; convergent operation is expected to occur precisely among those threads of an; implementation-defined execution scope (such as workgroup or subgroup) for; which ``condition`` is true:. .. code-block:: c++. void example_kernel() {; ...; if (condition); convergent_operation();; ...; }. In structured programming languages, there is often an intuitive and; unambiguous way of determining the threads that are expected to communicate.; However, this is not always the case even in structured programming languages,; and the intuition breaks down entirely in unstructured control flow. This; document describes the formal semantics in LLVM, i.e. how to determine the set; of communicating threads for convergent operations.

General; ================================. * Use a high resolution timer, e.g. perf under linux. * Run the benchmark multiple times to be able to recognize noise. * Disable as many processes or services as possible on the target system. * Disable frequency scaling, turbo boost and address space; randomization (see OS specific section). * Static link if the OS supports it. That avoids any variation that; might be introduced by loading dynamic libraries. This can be done; by passing ``-DLLVM_BUILD_STATIC=ON`` to cmake. * Try to avoid storage. On some systems you can use tmpfs. Putting the; program, inputs and outputs on tmpfs avoids touching a real storage; system, which can have a pretty big variability. To mount it (on linux and freebsd at least)::. mount -t tmpfs -o size=<XX>g none dir_to_mount.

If using perf, leave at least 2 cores; so that perf runs in one and your program in another::. cset shield -c N1,N2 -k on. This will move all threads out of N1 and N2.

Integrability,"==================================; LLVM Alias Analysis Infrastructure; ==================================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. Alias Analysis (aka Pointer Analysis) is a class of techniques which attempt to; determine whether or not two pointers ever can point to the same object in; memory. There are many different algorithms for alias analysis and many; different ways of classifying them: flow-sensitive vs. flow-insensitive,; context-sensitive vs. context-insensitive, field-sensitive; vs. field-insensitive, unification-based vs. subset-based, etc. Traditionally,; alias analyses respond to a query with a `Must, May, or No`_ alias response,; indicating that two pointers always point to the same object, might point to the; same object, or are known to never point to the same object. The LLVM `AliasAnalysis; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__ class is the; primary interface used by clients and implementations of alias analyses in the; LLVM system. This class is the common interface between clients of alias; analysis information and the implementations providing it, and is designed to; support a wide range of implementations and clients (but currently all clients; are assumed to be flow-insensitive). In addition to simple alias analysis; information, this class exposes Mod/Ref information from those implementations; which can provide it, allowing for powerful analyses and transformations to work; well together. This document contains information necessary to successfully implement this; interface, use it, and to test both sides. It also explains some of the finer; points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview; ================================.

Integrability,"=====================================. This document describes a format for specifying how to replay single; compilations independently of the build system. Background; ==========. Tools based on the C++ Abstract Syntax Tree need full information how to; parse a translation unit. Usually this information is implicitly; available in the build system, but running tools as part of the build; system is not necessarily the best solution:. - Build systems are inherently change driven, so running multiple tools; over the same code base without changing the code does not fit into; the architecture of many build systems.; - Figuring out whether things have changed is often an IO bound; process; this makes it hard to build low latency end user tools based; on the build system.; - Build systems are inherently sequential in the build graph, for; example due to generated source code. While tools that run; independently of the build still need the generated source code to; exist, running tools multiple times over unchanging source does not; require serialization of the runs according to the build dependency; graph. Supported Systems; =================. Clang has the ability to generate compilation database fragments via; ``-MJ argument <clang -MJ\<arg>>``. You can concatenate those; fragments together between ``[`` and ``]`` to create a compilation database. Currently `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ (since 2.8.5) supports generation; of compilation databases for Unix Makefile builds (Ninja builds in the; works) with the option ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS``. For projects on Linux, there is an alternative to intercept compiler; calls with a tool called `Bear <https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>`_. `Bazel <https://bazel.build>`_ can export a compilation database via; `this extractor extension; <https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor>`_.; Bazel is otherwise resistant to Bear and other compiler-intercept; techniques.

Integrability,"=====================================. Writing a new alias analysis implementation for LLVM is quite straight-forward.; There are already several implementations that you can use for examples, and the; following information should help fill in any details. For examples, take a; look at the `various alias analysis implementations`_ included with LLVM. Different Pass styles; ---------------------. The first step to determining what type of :doc:`LLVM pass <WritingAnLLVMPass>`; you need to use for your Alias Analysis. As is the case with most other; analyses and transformations, the answer should be fairly obvious from what type; of problem you are trying to solve:. #. If you require interprocedural analysis, it should be a ``Pass``.; #. If you are a function-local analysis, subclass ``FunctionPass``.; #. If you don't need to look at the program at all, subclass ``ImmutablePass``. In addition to the pass that you subclass, you should also inherit from the; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface, of course, and use the ``RegisterAnalysisGroup``; template to register as an implementation of ``AliasAnalysis``. Required initialization calls; -----------------------------. Your subclass of ``AliasAnalysis`` is required to invoke two methods on the; ``AliasAnalysis`` base class: ``getAnalysisUsage`` and; ``InitializeAliasAnalysis``. In particular, your implementation of; ``getAnalysisUsage`` should explicitly call into the; ``AliasAnalysis::getAnalysisUsage`` method in addition to doing any declaring; any pass dependencies your pass has. Thus you should have something like this:. .. code-block:: c++. void getAnalysisUsage(AnalysisUsage &AU) const {; AliasAnalysis::getAnalysisUsage(AU);; // declare your dependencies here.; }. Additionally, your must invoke the ``InitializeAliasAnalysis`` method from your; analysis run method (``run`` for a ``Pass``, ``runOnFunction`` for a; ``FunctionPass``, or ``InitializePass`` for an ``ImmutablePass``). For example; (as part of a ``Pass``):. .. code-",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst:10534,interface,interface,10534,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

The most direct way is to specify the necessary commandline options; of the Clang frontend manually (and generate the prerequisite dependencies of the specific import method by hand).

Entries in the index *must* have an `.ast` suffix if the goal; is to use PCH-based analysis, as the lack of that extension signals that the entry is to be used as a source-file, and parsed on-demand.; This tool uses a :doc:`compilation database <../../JSONCompilationDatabase>` to; determine the compilation flags used.; The analysis invocation must be provided with the directory which contains the dumps and the mapping files.

Integrability,"=====================================; Garbage Collection with LLVM; =====================================. .. contents::; :local:. Abstract; ========. This document covers how to integrate LLVM into a compiler for a language which; supports garbage collection. **Note that LLVM itself does not provide a; garbage collector.** You must provide your own. Quick Start; ============. First, you should pick a collector strategy. LLVM includes a number of built; in ones, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to kno",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst:180,integrat,integrate,180,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrate']
Integrability,"=======================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members.; Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members.; However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:; it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below). An object that is being read from disk may have been constructed by `RField::CreateValue()`.; In this case, the deleter returned by `RField::GetDeleter()` releases the resources. When reading collections of type `T` (`std::vector<T>`, `ROOT::RVec<T>`, ...), RNTuple uses `RField::CreateValue()` to construct elements of the inner type `T`.; As the size of a collection changes from event to event, this has the following effect on its elements; - If the collection shrinks, cut-off elements are destructed; - If the collection grows, new elements are constructed before reading them; - If the array buffer of the collection is reallocated (may happen for both shrinking and growing depending on the collection), all elements are destructed first in the old buffer; and the new number of elements is constructed in the new buffer. So unless the collection buffer needs to be reallocated, RNTuple tries to avoid unnecessary destruction/construction but instead overwrites existing objects.; Note that RNTuple currently does not copy or move existing objects when the collection buffer is reallocated. Naming Conventions; ==================. For byte arrays and collections of things, the RNTuple code uses the following variable name suffixes:; - `XyzSize` denotes the size of Xyz in bytes on disk, i.e. after compression. Example: `fPageListSize`.; - `XyzLength` denotes the size of Xyz in bytes in memory, i.e. uncompressed. Example: `fPageListLength`.; - `NXyz` denotes the number of Xyz items in a collection. Example: `fNPageLists`.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md:31203,depend,depending,31203,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,1,['depend'],['depending']

The SYCL specification represents pointers to disjoint memory regions using C++; wrapper classes on an accelerator to enable compilation with a standard C++; toolchain and a SYCL compiler toolchain. Section 3.8.2 of SYCL 2020; specification defines; `memory model <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#_sycl_device_memory_model>`_\ ,; section 4.7.7 - `address space classes <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#_address_space_classes>`_; and section 5.9 covers `address space deduction <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#_address_space_deduction>`_.; The SYCL specification allows two modes of address space deduction: ""generic as; default address space"" (see section 5.9.3) and ""inferred address space"" (see; section 5.9.4). Current implementation supports only ""generic as default address; space"" mode. SYCL borrows its memory model from OpenCL however SYCL doesn't perform; the address space qualifier inference as detailed in; `OpenCL C v3.0 6.7.8 <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_C.html#addr-spaces-inference>`_.

This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form.

Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review.

Integrability,"=================================================; Choosing the Right Interface for Your Application; =================================================. Clang provides infrastructure to write tools that need syntactic and semantic; information about a program. This document will give a short introduction of; the different ways to write clang tools, and their pros and cons. LibClang; --------. `LibClang <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html>`_ is a stable high; level C interface to clang. When in doubt LibClang is probably the interface; you want to use. Consider the other interfaces only when you have a good; reason not to use LibClang. Canonical examples of when to use LibClang:. * Xcode; * Clang Python Bindings. Use LibClang when you...:. * want to interface with clang from other languages than C++; * need a stable interface that takes care to be backwards compatible; * want powerful high-level abstractions, like iterating through an AST with a; cursor, and don't want to learn all the nitty gritty details of Clang's AST. Do not use LibClang when you...:. * want full control over the Clang AST. Clang Plugins; -------------. :doc:`Clang Plugins <ClangPlugins>` allow you to run additional actions on the; AST as part of a compilation. Plugins are dynamic libraries that are loaded at; runtime by the compiler, and they're easy to integrate into your build; environment. Canonical examples of when to use Clang Plugins:. * special lint-style warnings or errors for your project; * creating additional build artifacts from a single compile step. Use Clang Plugins when you...:. * need your tool to rerun if any of the dependencies change; * want your tool to make or break a build; * need full control over the Clang AST.

The Kaleidoscope Language; =========================. This tutorial is illustrated with a toy language called; ""`Kaleidoscope <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope>`_"" (derived; from ""meaning beautiful, form, and view""). Kaleidoscope is a procedural; language that allows you to define functions, use conditionals, math,; etc. Over the course of the tutorial, we'll extend Kaleidoscope to; support the if/then/else construct, a for loop, user defined operators,; JIT compilation with a simple command line interface, debug info, etc. We want to keep things simple, so the only datatype in Kaleidoscope; is a 64-bit floating point type (aka 'double' in C parlance). As such,; all values are implicitly double precision and the language doesn't; require type declarations. This gives the language a very nice and; simple syntax. For example, the following simple example computes; `Fibonacci numbers: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`_. ::. # Compute the x'th fibonacci number.; def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2). # This expression will compute the 40th number.; fib(40). We also allow Kaleidoscope to call into standard library functions - the; LLVM JIT makes this really easy. This means that you can use the; 'extern' keyword to define a function before you use it (this is also; useful for mutually recursive functions). For example:. ::. extern sin(arg);; extern cos(arg);; extern atan2(arg1 arg2);. atan2(sin(.4), cos(42)). A more interesting example is included in Chapter 6 where we write a; little Kaleidoscope application that `displays a Mandelbrot; Set <LangImpl06.html#kicking-the-tires>`_ at various levels of magnification.

Integrability,"======================================================; LLVM Link Time Optimization: Design and Implementation; ======================================================. .. contents::; :local:. Description; ===========. LLVM features powerful intermodular optimizations which can be used at link; time. Link Time Optimization (LTO) is another name for intermodular; optimization when performed during the link stage. This document describes the; interface and design between the LTO optimizer and the linker. Design Philosophy; =================. The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document.

In order to fit a data sets we need a model to describe our data, e.g. a probability density function describing our observed data or; an hypothetical function describing the relation between the independent variables **`X`** and the single dependent variable `Y`.; We can have an arbitrary number `k` of independent variables. For example, when fitting a `k`-dimensional histogram,; the independent variables **`X`** are the bin center coordinates and `Y` is the bin weight. The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters. This interface extends the abstract class `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`, with methods to set/retrieve parameter values and to evaluate the function given the; independent vector of values **`X`** and vector of parameters `P`.; More information about the different `ROOT::Math` function interfaces is available in the Mathematical Library chapter. An end-user can convert a **`TF1`** object in a `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, using the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrapperMultiTF1`:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""gaus"");; ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 fitFunction(f1, f1->GetNdim() );; ROOT::Fit::Fitter fitter;; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; ```.

The Frontend Library; ====================. The Frontend library contains functionality useful for building tools on top of; the Clang libraries, for example several methods for outputting diagnostics. Compiler Invocation; -------------------. One of the classes provided by the Frontend library is ``CompilerInvocation``,; which holds information that describe current invocation of the Clang ``-cc1``; frontend. The information typically comes from the command line constructed by; the Clang driver or from clients performing custom initialization. The data; structure is split into logical units used by different parts of the compiler,; for example ``PreprocessorOptions``, ``LanguageOptions`` or ``CodeGenOptions``. Command Line Interface; ----------------------. The command line interface of the Clang ``-cc1`` frontend is defined alongside; the driver options in ``clang/Driver/Options.td``. The information making up an; option definition includes its prefix and name (for example ``-std=``), form and; position of the option value, help text, aliases and more. Each option may; belong to a certain group and can be marked with zero or more flags. Options; accepted by the ``-cc1`` frontend are marked with the ``CC1Option`` flag. Command Line Parsing; --------------------. Option definitions are processed by the ``-gen-opt-parser-defs`` tablegen; backend during early stages of the build. Options are then used for querying an; instance ``llvm::opt::ArgList``, a wrapper around the command line arguments.; This is done in the Clang driver to construct individual jobs based on the; driver arguments and also in the ``CompilerInvocation::CreateFromArgs`` function; that parses the ``-cc1`` frontend arguments.

Note that installation of GSL and the ROOT MathMore package is needed to access the GSL Minimizers and that the GSL; Minimizer do not implement error analysis. New numeric integration algorithms available; RooFit can now interface all MathCore numeric integration; algorithms. In this release ROOT::Math::AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim,; which implements the 'Genz & Malik' algorithm has been interfaced; in RooAdaptiveIntegratorND and is now the default numeric integrator; for numeric integrations in two or more dimensions. This new default integrator has much improved stability and speed; for relatively smooth p.d.f.s in two or three dimensions and can; generally be used well for p.d.f. normalization integrals without; causing MINUIT converge problems due to numeric precision issues. In future release some more numeric integrators will be migrated to; a MathCore implementation. Interface to TFoam adaptive MC sampler added; RooFit can now use the TFoam adaptive MC sampler for event generation of p.d.f.s that; do not have an internal generator. The TFoam generator adaptively subdivides the; observable space and is generally more efficient both warmup and generation than the original; RooAcceptReject algorithm. In its current interface in RooFit, TFoam cannot; handle problems yet with discrete observables or conditional observables. For those problems; the original RooAcceptReject generator is still used. The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class RooNumGenConfig, which; is similar in style and structure, to RooNumIntConfig which configures the choice of; numeric integration algorithm. A new tutorial macro rf902_numgenconfig.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of the steering. A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the; end of the RooFit section of the release notes.

We will call these leaves (by; analogy with a tree structure). On the other hand, any volume is a small world by itself - what we need; to do is to take it out and to ignore all the rest since it is a; self-contained object. In fact, the modeller can act like this,; considering a given volume as temporary MARS, but we will describe this; feature later on. Let us focus on the biggest pack - it is mandatory to; define one. Consider the simplest geometry that is made of a single box.; Here is an example on how to build it:. ### Example 1: Creating the World. We first need to load the geometry library. This is not needed if one; does `make map` in root folder. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gSystem->Load(""libGeom"");; ```. Second, we have to create an instance of the geometry manager class.; This takes care of all the modeller components, performing several tasks; to insure geometry validity and containing the user interface for; building and interacting with the geometry. After its creation, the; geometry manager class can be accessed with the global; ***`gGeoManager`***:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] new TGeoManager(""world"", ""the simplest geometry"");; ```. We want to create a single volume in our geometry, but since any volume; needs to have an associated medium, we will create a dummy one. You can; safely ignore the following lines for the time being, since materials; and media will be explained in detail later on. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoMaterial *mat = new TGeoMaterial(""Vacuum"",0,0,0);; root[] TGeoMedium *med = new TGeoMedium(""Vacuum"",1,mat);; ```. We can finally make our volume having a box shape. Note that the world; volume does not need to be a box - it can be any other shape. Generally,; boxes and tubes are the most recommendable shapes for this purpose due; to their fast navigation algorithms. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoVolume *top=gGeoManager->MakeBox(""Top"",med,10.,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:2462,interface,interface,2462,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

The infrastructure that exists for caching p.d.f.s, i.e. p.d.f that precalculate their value; for all observable values at one and cache those in a histogram that is returned as p.d.f shape; (with optional interpolation), has been expanded. This infrastructure comprises RooAbsCached; the base class for all caching p.d.fs, RooAbsSelfCachedPdf a base class for end-user; caching p.d.f implementations that simply cache the result of evaluate() and RooCachedPdf; that can wrap and cache any input p.d.f specified in its constructor. .

In addition to analysis queries, you must make sure to unconditionally pass LLVM; `update notification`_ methods to the superclass as well if you override them,; which allows all alias analyses in a change to be updated. .. _update notification:. Updating analysis results for transformations; ---------------------------------------------. Alias analysis information is initially computed for a static snapshot of the; program, but clients will use this information to make transformations to the; code. All but the most trivial forms of alias analysis will need to have their; analysis results updated to reflect the changes made by these transformations. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes four methods which are used to; communicate program changes from the clients to the analysis implementations.; Various alias analysis implementations should use these methods to ensure that; their internal data structures are kept up-to-date as the program changes (for; example, when an instruction is deleted), and clients of alias analysis must be; sure to call these interfaces appropriately. The ``deleteValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``deleteValue`` method is called by transformations when they remove an; instruction or any other value from the program (including values that do not; use pointers). Typically alias analyses keep data structures that have entries; for each value in the program. When this method is called, they should remove; any entries for the specified value, if they exist. The ``copyValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``copyValue`` method is used when a new value is introduced into the; program. There is no way to introduce a value into the program that did not; exist before (this doesn't make sense for a safe compiler transformation), so; this is the only way to introduce a new value. This method indicates that the; new value has exactly the same properties as the value being copied.

A lot of effort went into improving the thread-safety of Core and Meta classes / functions. A special thanks to Chris Jones from CMS!. #### std::string_view. Introduce a preview of C++17's std::string_view. To take advantage of this new; class use:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""RStringView.h""; ```; The documentation of this can be found at `http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/basic_string_view`; The implementation provided is extracted from libcxx. Whenever the current; compiler and standard library provide an implmentation, it is used. The type string_view describes an object that can refer to a constant contiguous sequence of char-like objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. This type is used throughout the ROOT code to avoid copying strings when a; sub-string is needed and to extent interfaces that uses to take a const char*; to take a std::string_view as thus be able to be directly directly passed a; TString, a std::string or a std::string_view.

Integrability,"At the end of this chapter is a glossary of thread specific terms. ## Implementation of Threads in ROOT. The **`TThread`** class has been developed to provide a platform; independent interface to threads for ROOT. ### Installation. For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version; of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations.; We hope that this will become the default later. To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):. ```; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; ```. This configures and builds ROOT using `/usr/lib/libpthread.so` as the; `Pthread` library, and defines `R__THREAD`. This enables the thread specific treatment of *`gPad`*, and creates; `$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.`. Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate; ROOT keyword for your platform. ### Classes. **`TThread`** class implements threads . The platform dependent; implementation is in the **`TThreadImp`** class and its descendant; classes (e.g. **`TPosixThread`** ). **`TMutex`** class implements `mutex` locks. A mutex is a mutually; exclusive lock. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** class and its descendant classes (e.g.; **`TPosixMutex`**). **`TCondition`** class implements a condition variable. Use a condition; variable to signal threads. The platform dependent implementation is in; the **`TConditionImp`** and **`TPosixCondition`** classes . **`TSemaphore`** class implements a counting semaphore. Use a semaphore; to synchronize threads. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** and **`TConditionImp`** classes. ### TThread for Pedestrians. To run a thread in ROOT, follow these steps:. 1. Initialization.

The Gviz3d module provides an interface for inspecting objects collections.; TStructViewer represents a class, a struct or any other type as an; object in 3D space.; At the top of the scene we can see objects depending on a pointer root. Under it we see; pointers and collection elements. Collections must inherit from TCollection; or be STL collections. We can change the number of visible levels or objects on the scene with the GUI or; methods. The Size of objects in the geometry scene is proportional to memory taken by this object; or to the number of objects inside this object. An easy way to find some class in the viewer is to change the color of a type.; We can connect for example TF2 class with red color or connect all classes; inheriting from TF2 by adding plus to name. For example typename ""TF2+"" tells us; that all classes inheriting from TF2 will be red. Navigatiion in the viewer is very simple like in usual GLViewer.

When libFuzzer is not a good solution for a problem?; ---------------------------------------------------------. * If the test inputs are validated by the target library and the validator; asserts/crashes on invalid inputs, in-process fuzzing is not applicable.; * Bugs in the target library may accumulate without being detected. E.g. a memory; corruption that goes undetected at first and then leads to a crash while; testing another input. This is why it is highly recommended to run this; in-process fuzzer with all sanitizers to detect most bugs on the spot.; * It is harder to protect the in-process fuzzer from excessive memory; consumption and infinite loops in the target library (still possible).; * The target library should not have significant global state that is not; reset between the runs.; * Many interesting target libraries are not designed in a way that supports; the in-process fuzzer interface (e.g. require a file path instead of a; byte array).; * If a single test run takes a considerable fraction of a second (or; more) the speed benefit from the in-process fuzzer is negligible.; * If the target library runs persistent threads (that outlive; execution of one test) the fuzzing results will be unreliable. Q. So, what exactly this Fuzzer is good for?; --------------------------------------------. This Fuzzer might be a good choice for testing libraries that have relatively; small inputs, each input takes < 10ms to run, and the library code is not expected; to crash on invalid inputs.; Examples: regular expression matchers, text or binary format parsers, compression,; network, crypto.

Integrability,"By Chris:. LLVM has been designed with two primary goals in mind. First we strive to ; enable the best possible division of labor between static and dynamic ; compilers, and second, we need a flexible and powerful interface ; between these two complementary stages of compilation. We feel that ; providing a solution to these two goals will yield an excellent solution ; to the performance problem faced by modern architectures and programming ; languages. A key insight into current compiler and runtime systems is that a ; compiler may fall in anywhere in a ""continuum of compilation"" to do its ; job. On one side, scripting languages statically compile nothing and ; dynamically compile (or equivalently, interpret) everything. On the far ; other side, traditional static compilers process everything statically and ; nothing dynamically. These approaches have typically been seen as a ; tradeoff between performance and portability. On a deeper level, however, ; there are two reasons that optimal system performance may be obtained by a; system somewhere in between these two extremes: Dynamic application ; behavior and social constraints. From a technical perspective, pure static compilation cannot ever give ; optimal performance in all cases, because applications have varying dynamic; behavior that the static compiler cannot take into consideration. Even ; compilers that support profile guided optimization generate poor code in ; the real world, because using such optimization tunes that application ; to one particular usage pattern, whereas real programs (as opposed to ; benchmarks) often have several different usage patterns. On a social level, static compilation is a very shortsighted solution to ; the performance problem. Instruction set architectures (ISAs) continuously ; evolve, and each implementation of an ISA (a processor) must choose a set ; of tradeoffs that make sense in the market context that it is designed for. ; With every new processor introduced, the vendor f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt:214,interface,interface,214,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,1,['interface'],['interface']

Anything older than these toolchains *may* work, but will require forcing the; build system with a special option and is not really a supported host platform.; Also note that older versions of these compilers have often crashed or; miscompiled LLVM. For less widely used host toolchains such as ICC or xlC, be aware that a very; recent version may be required to support all of the C++ features used in LLVM.

Implementation Details; ======================. Interpreter as a REPL vs. as a Library; --------------------------------------. 1 - If we're using the interpreter in interactive (REPL) mode, it will dump; the value (i.e., value printing). .. code-block:: console. if (LastValue.isValid()) {; if (!V) {; LastValue.dump();; LastValue.clear();; } else; *V = std::move(LastValue);; }. 2 - If we're using the interpreter as a library, then it will pass the value; to the user. Incremental AST Consumer; ------------------------. The ``IncrementalASTConsumer`` class wraps the original code generator; ``ASTConsumer`` and it performs a hook, to traverse all the top-level decls, to; look for expressions to synthesize, based on the ``isSemiMissing()`` condition. If this condition is found to be true, then ``Interp.SynthesizeExpr()`` will be; invoked. **Note:** Following is a sample code snippet. Actual code may vary over time. .. code-block:: console. for (Decl *D : DGR); if (auto *TSD = llvm::dyn_cast<TopLevelStmtDecl>(D);; TSD && TSD->isSemiMissing()); TSD->setStmt(Interp.SynthesizeExpr(cast<Expr>(TSD->getStmt())));. return Consumer->HandleTopLevelDecl(DGR);. The synthesizer will then choose the relevant expression, based on its type. Communication between Compiled Code and Interpreted Code; --------------------------------------------------------. In Clang-Repl there is **interpreted code**, and this feature adds a 'value'; runtime that can talk to the **compiled code**. Following is an example where the compiled code interacts with the interpreter; code.

Program Dependence Graph; ========================. The Program Dependence Graph (or PDG) has a similar structure as the; DDG, but it is capable of representing both data dependencies and; control-flow dependencies between program elements such as; instructions, groups of instructions, basic blocks or groups of; basic blocks. High-Level Design; =================. The DDG and the PDG are both directed graphs and they extend the; ``DirectedGraph`` class. Each implementation extends its corresponding; node and edge types resulting in the inheritance relationship depicted; in the UML diagram below:. .. image:: uml_nodes_and_edges.png. Graph Construction; ------------------. The graph build algorithm considers dependencies between elements of; a given set of instructions or basic blocks. Any dependencies coming; into or going out of instructions that do not belong to that range; are ignored. The steps in the build algorithm for the DDG are very; similar to the steps in the build algorithm for the PDG. As such,; one of the design goals is to reuse the build algorithm code to; allow creation of both DDG and PDG representations while allowing; the two implementations to define their own distinct and independent; node and edge types. This is achieved by using the well-known builder; design pattern to isolate the construction of the dependence graph; from its concrete representation. The following UML diagram depicts the overall structure of the design; pattern as it applies to the dependence graph implementation. .. image:: uml_builder_pattern.png.

Integrability,"DLE` plots as requested; [here](https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20225&p=87006#p87006). ### TTeXDump. From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues for the proper line wrapping (this is the one implemented in; this change). ### TLatex. Make sure the line width used to draw `#sqrt` is always >= 1. When a global text alignment was set the `TLatex`characters `#minus`, `#plus`,; `#mp`, `#hbar`, and `#backslash` were mis-aligned. The following macro demonstrate; the problem:. ``` {.cpp}; {; gStyle->SetTextAlign(22);; TLatex t(.5,.5,""#minus100 #mp100 #plus100 #hbar #backslash"");; t.Draw();; }; ```. The angle of a `TLatex` object was set to 0 if the `GetYsize` method was called. ### TColor. New palette `kViridis`. It was presented at SciPy2015 by Stéfan van der Walt and; Nathaniel Smith. It is now matplotlib's current default color map. ![Viridis](palette_112.png). ### TMultiGraph. Ignore empty graphs when computing the multi-graph range at painting time. ### TASImage.

A progress bar is a widget that shows that an operation is in progress; and how much time is left. It is a long rectangular bar, initially; empty, that fills with a color as a process is being performed. The; filled-in area indicates the percentage of the process that has been; completed. You should use this widget for waits exceeding `one minute`.; For a very time consuming operation it is better to break the operation; into subtasks and provide a progress bar for each of them. ![](pictures/0200021E.jpg). A progress bar may be oriented horizontally or vertically. The; horizontally oriented progress bar fills with a color from left to; right; the vertically oriented - from bottom to top. A percent complete; message provides an indication of the completed part of the process. It; is a good practice to include some descriptive text of the process to; keep users informed and entertained while they are waiting for process; completion.

Integrability,"Date: Sat, 18 Nov 2000 09:19:35 -0600 (CST); From: Vikram Adve <vadve@cs.uiuc.edu>; To: Chris Lattner <lattner@cs.uiuc.edu>; Subject: a few thoughts. I've been mulling over the virtual machine problem and I had some; thoughts about some things for us to think about discuss:. 1. We need to be clear on our goals for the VM. Do we want to emphasize; portability and safety like the Java VM? Or shall we focus on the; architecture interface first (i.e., consider the code generation and; processor issues), since the architecture interface question is also; important for portable Java-type VMs?. This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; different. Architects and many compiler people care much more about; the second question. The Java compiler and OS community care much more; about the first one. Also, while the architecture interface question is important for; Java-type VMs, the design constraints are very different. 2. Design issues to consider (an initial list that we should continue; to modify). Note that I'm not trying to suggest actual solutions here,; but just various directions we can pursue:. a. A single-assignment VM, which we've both already been thinking about. b. A strongly-typed VM. One question is do we need the types to be; explicitly declared or should they be inferred by the dynamic compiler?. c.

I forsee the architecture looking kinda like this: (which is completely; subject to change). 1. The VM code is NOT guaranteed safe in a java sense.

Additionally, we would like; to be able to statically eliminate many bounds checks in Java; programs... for example. 2. Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key.

I've updated the documentation to include load store and allocation; instructions (please take a look and let me know if I'm on the right; track):. file:/home/vadve/lattner/llvm/docs/LangRef.html#memoryops. I have a couple of concerns I would like to bring up:. 1. Reference types; Right now, I've spec'd out the language to have a pointer type, which; works fine for lots of stuff... except that Java really has; references: constrained pointers that cannot be manipulated: added and; subtracted, moved, etc... Do we want to have a type like this? It; could be very nice for analysis (pointer always points to the start of; an object, etc...) and more closely matches Java semantics. The; pointer type would be kept for C++ like semantics. Through analysis,; C++ pointers could be promoted to references in the LLVM; representation. 2. Our ""implicit"" memory references in assembly language:; After thinking about it, this model has two problems:; A. If you do pointer analysis and realize that two stores are; independent and can share the same memory source object, there is; no way to represent this in either the bytecode or assembly.; B. When parsing assembly/bytecode, we effectively have to do a full; SSA generation/PHI node insertion pass to build the dependencies; when we don't want the ""pinned"" representation. This is not; cool.; I'm tempted to make memory references explicit in both the assembly and; bytecode to get around this... what do you think?. -Chris.

I have a budding idea about making LLVM a little more ambitious: a; customizable runtime system that can be used to implement language-specific; virtual machines for many different languages. E.g., a C vm, a C++ vm, a; Java vm, a Lisp vm, .. The idea would be that LLVM would provide a standard set of runtime features; (some low-level like standard assembly instructions with code generation and; static and runtime optimization; some higher-level like type-safety and; perhaps a garbage collection library). Each language vm would select the; runtime features needed for that language, extending or customizing them as; needed. Most of the machine-dependent code-generation and optimization; features as well as low-level machine-independent optimizations (like PRE); could be provided by LLVM and should be sufficient for any language,; simplifying the language compiler. (This would also help interoperability; between languages.) Also, some or most of the higher-level; machine-independent features like type-safety and access safety should be; reusable by different languages, with minor extensions. The language; compiler could then focus on language-specific analyses and optimizations. The risk is that this sounds like a universal IR -- something that the; compiler community has tried and failed to develop for decades, and is; universally skeptical about. No matter what we say, we won't be able to; convince anyone that we have a universal IR that will work. We need to; think about whether LLVM is different or if has something novel that might; convince people. E.g., the idea of providing a package of separable; features that different languages select from. Also, using SSA with or; without type-safety as the intermediate representation.

Integrability,"DiagnosticConsumer:. The ``DiagnosticConsumer`` Interface; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once code generates a diagnostic with all of the arguments and the rest of the; relevant information, Clang needs to know what to do with it. As previously; mentioned, the diagnostic machinery goes through some filtering to map a; severity onto a diagnostic level, then (assuming the diagnostic is not mapped; to ""``Ignore``"") it invokes an object that implements the ``DiagnosticConsumer``; interface with the information. It is possible to implement this interface in many different ways. For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments. For example, an HTML output might want declaration names be; linkified to where they come from in the source. Another example is that a GUI; might let you click on typedefs to expand them. This application would want to; pass significantly more information about types through to the GUI than a; simple flat string. The interface allows this to happen. .. _internals-diag-translation:.

Speed of four matrix operations have been compared between four matrix; libraries, `GSL` `CLHEP`, `ROOT v3.10` and `ROOT v4.0`. Next figure; shows the `CPU` time for these four operations as a function of the; matrix size:. 1. `A*B` The execution time is measured for the sum of A \* Bsym,; Bsym\* A and A \* B. Notice the matrix\_size3 dependence of execution; time. `CLHEP` results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric; matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size; 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A \* Bsym takes 0.028 sec and; Bsym\* A takes 0.059 sec. Both `GSL` and `ROOT v4.0` can be setup to use the hardware-optimized; multiplication routines of the `BLAS` libraries. It was tested on a G4; PowerPC. The improvement becomes clearly visible around sizes of (50x50); were the execution speed improvement of the Altivec processor becomes; more significant than the overhead of filling its pipe. 2. $A^{-1}$ Here, the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion. Except for `ROOT v3.10`, the algorithms are all based on an; `LU `factorization followed by forward/back-substitution. `ROOT v3.10`; is using the slower Gaussian elimination method.

Integrability,"Examples; --------. The following code demonstrates the use of object subscripting syntax; with ``NSMutableArray`` and ``NSMutableDictionary`` objects:. .. code-block:: objc. NSMutableArray *array = ...;; NSUInteger idx = ...;; id newObject = ...;; id oldObject = array[idx];; array[idx] = newObject; // replace oldObject with newObject. NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = ...;; NSString *key = ...;; oldObject = dictionary[key];; dictionary[key] = newObject; // replace oldObject with newObject. The next section explains how subscripting expressions map to accessor; methods. Subscripting Methods; --------------------. Objective-C supports two kinds of subscript expressions: *array-style*; subscript expressions use integer typed subscripts; *dictionary-style*; subscript expressions use Objective-C object pointer typed subscripts.; Each type of subscript expression is mapped to a message send using a; predefined selector. The advantage of this design is flexibility: class; designers are free to introduce subscripting by declaring methods or by; adopting protocols. Moreover, because the method names are selected by; the type of the subscript, an object can be subscripted using both array; and dictionary styles. Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When the subscript operand has an integral type, the expression is; rewritten to use one of two different selectors, depending on whether; the element is being read or written. When an expression reads an; element using an integral index, as in the following example:. .. code-block:: objc. NSUInteger idx = ...;; id value = object[idx];. it is translated into a call to ``objectAtIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. id value = [object objectAtIndexedSubscript:idx];. When an expression writes an element using an integral index:. .. code-block:: objc. object[idx] = newValue;. it is translated to a call to ``setObject:atIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. [object setObject:newValue atIndexedSubscript:idx];.

Integrability,"File`, and `TNetXNGFile`.; In either case, the `RRawFile` owns its own file descriptor and does not interfere with `TFile` objects concurrently reading the file.; For anchors from files of other dynamic type, including all other `TFile` subclasses, the file is wrapped in a `RRawFileTFile` and access is shared. On-Disk Encoding; ----------------. ### Writing Case; The following steps are taken to write RNTuple data to disk:. 1. On creation of the RNTupleWriter, the header is written to disk; 2. Upon `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`, the RField<T> class _serializes_ the object into its column representation.; To this end, it uses the `RColumn` class to append elements to the columns page buffer (`RPage`); 3. When a page buffer is full (cf. tuning.md), it is sent to the page sink for writing it to disk.; Note that page boundaries do _not_ need to align with entry boundaries,; e.g. information from a single entry can span multiple pages.; 1. The page is _packed_:; depending on the type of the page, a light encoding is applied to facilitate compression, e.g., byte splitting (`RColumnElement`).; Big-endian / little-endian conversion takes place here.; 2. The packed page is _compressed_ according to the user-provided compression settings (default: zstd).; A packed and compressed page is _sealed_.; 3. The sealed page is written to the storage backend.; 4. When the target cluster size is reached (cf. tuning.md), the `Fill()` method automatically commits the cluster.; The user can also manually commit a cluster.; 5. When the dataset is committed (e.g., on destruction of the RNTupleWriter), the page list, the footer, and the anchor are written to disk. The header, footer, and page list are compressed. If the buffered sink is used (default), the pages of a cluster are buffered until the cluster is committed.; On committing the cluster, all pages are sealed and sent to a _persistent sink_ in one go (vector write).; Pages are also reordered to ensure locality of pages of the same column.

Integrability,"Fit are 10 - 20% faster. #### Legacy iterators; The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops. **Important caveat**:; The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)! Using the legacy iterators with the new collections (*i.e.* in existing code), mutating the collection is still possible in the following cases:; - Inserting/deleting elements **after** the current iterator.; - Changing an element at a position **other than** the current iterator; - **But not** inserting/deleting before/at the current iterator position. With a debug build (with assertions), the legacy iterators will check that the collection is not mutated. In a release build, elements might be skipped or be iterated twice. #### Moving away from the slower iterators; The legacy iterators have been flagged with a special deprecation macro that can be used help the user use the recommended ROOT interface. Defining one of the [deprecation macros](#preprocessor-deprecation-macros) (either in a single translation unit or in the build system), and creating a legacy iterator will trigger a compiler warning such as:; ```; <path>/RooChebychev.cxx:66:34: warning: 'createIterator' is deprecated: There is a superior alternative: begin(), end() and range-based for loops.

The `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` compares two numbers for equality within a certain absolute range.; So far, it would tell you that `inf != inf` if you define `inf` as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`, which is inconsistent with the regular `==` operator. This is unexpected, because one would expect that if two numbers are considered exactly equal, they would also be considered equal within any range.; Therefore, the behavior of `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` was changed to return always `true` if the `==` comparison would return `true`. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Changes in RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf.

Similarly, the `dependents()` method of RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf will only return the list of actual value servers. ### Removal of the RooGenFunction and RooMultiGenFunction classes. The `RooGenFunction` was only a lightweight adaptor that exports a RooAbsReal as a `ROOT::Math::IGenFunction`.; The same can be easily achieved with the generic `ROOT::Math::Functor1D`, so in the spirit of not duplicating interfaces, the `RooGenFunction` is removed in this release. Here is an example that shows how to replace it in the unlikely case you were using it:. ```C++; RooArgSet normSet{x}; // normalization set. // Old way 1: create a RooGenFunction:; RooGenFunction func1{pdf, x, {}, normSet};. // Old way 2: use `RooAbsReal::iGenFunction()`:; std::unique_ptr<ROOT::Math::IGenFunction> func2{; pdf.iGenFunction(x, normSet); };. // How to do it now:; RooFunctor functor{pdf, x, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func3{functor};; // Functor1D takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```.

The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. Example of using `Functor`:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/Functor.h"". class MyFunction {. public:; double operator()(const double *x) const {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. double Eval(const double * x) const { return x[0]+x[1]; }; };. double freeFunction(const double * x ); {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. int main(); {; // test directly calling the function object; MyFunction myf;. // test from a free function pointer; ROOT::Math::Functor f1(&freeFunction,2);. // test from function object; ROOT::Math::Functor f2(myf,2);. // test from a member function; ROOT::Math::Functor f3(&myf,&MyFunction::Eval,2);. double x[] = {1,2};. cout << f1(x) << endl;; cout << f2(x) << endl;; cout << f3(x) << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. #### Wrapping Multi-dimensional Gradient Functions. The class `ROOT::Math::GradFunctor` is used to wrap in a very C++ callable object to make gradient functions. It can be constructed in three different way:; * From an object implementing both `double operator()( const double * )` for the function evaluation and `double Derivative(const double *, int icoord)` for the partial derivatives.; * From an object implementing any member function like `Foo::XXX(const double *)` for the function evaluation and any member function like `Foo::XXX(const double *, int icoord)` for the partial derivatives.; * From an function object implementing `double operator()( const double * )` for the function evaluation and another function object implementing `double operator() (const double *, int icoord)`; for the partial derivatives.

Integrability,"How to read and write custom classes in TTree; =============================================. This example shows how to use ROOT as a toolkit to write and read a TTree containing custom classes. # Starting steps. 1. Build the project, it requires ROOT. ```; cmake -B build -S . ; cmake --build build ; ```. 2. Run the executable. ```; ./build/treeExample; ```. 3. Inspect the output rootfile, and the source code. . # Files. This example shows how to use ROOT as a library in a C++ project. The C++ main function is defined in the file main.cpp. The code that writes the TTree onto disk is contained in the file writeTree.cxx. The files readTree.cxx and readTreeDF.cxx show two different ROOT interfaces to read a TTree. The files data2tree.* contain the code for the custom class that fills the TTree. ## Definition of custom class. The TTree can be seen as a collection of objects (branches), with a number of attributes (leaves). The name of the branch corresponds to the name of the instantiated object. The name of the leaves corresponds to the name of the attributes. The class that is present in the TTree is declared in the file data2tree.hpp, and the methods defined in the file data2tree.cpp. . To be able to read and write objects of a particular user-defined type, ROOT I/O needs to know some information about the class/struct, e.g. the class members and their types, offset of each data member, etc. This information is contained in a ROOT dictionary; see [I/O of custom classes](https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#generating-dictionaries) for more information. The linkdef file contains some instructions for ROOT, to specify which classes will require a dictionary:. ```; #pragma link C++ class myFancyClass+;; ```.

It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms. We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own. For instance, `cat header.h header.h | gcc -fsyntax-only -xc++ -`.; This command concatenates `header.h` twice before compiling it to make sure; it has proper include protectors.; * Enable it in `rootcling` -- rootcling can produce a C++ Modules-aware; dictionary when it is invoked with `-cxxmodule` flag.; * Modularization of external dependencies -- if a header file is not explicitly; nominated as part of a module and it is transitively included in two modules,; both modules contain that header file content. In other words, the header is; duplicated. In turn, this leads to performance regressions. If a dictionary; depends on a header (directly or indirectly) from a external library (e.g.; libxml) it needs to be modularized. As part of our ongoing efforts to move; CMSSW to use C++ Modules [[6]] we have implemented a helper tool [[7]]. The; tool detects (based on the include paths of the compiler) dependencies and; tries to generate the relevant vfs file. ## State of the union. Preloading all modules at start up time turn our motivating example into:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition. ```. becomes equivalent to. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import ROOT.*;; root [] ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:15098,depend,dependencies,15098,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

With this version we introduce a new module, core/multiproc, for multi-processing on multi-core machines. This module is based on fork technology and offers an interface inspired from Python multiprocessor module. The new interface, implemented in the class TProcPool, provides the possibility to perform in parallel a very generic set of tasks, described by macros, functions or lambdas. This illustrates the usage of lambdas:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TProcPool pool;; auto ten = pool.MapReduce([]() { return 1; }, 10, [](std::vector<int> v) { return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); }); }; ```. And this how it can be used to generate ten histos and merge them:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TObject *CreateAndFillHists(); {. TH1F *h = new TH1F(""h"", """", 100, -3., 3.);; h->SetDirectory(0);; h->FillRandom(""gaus"", 1000);; return h;; }. TProcPool pool;; auto hist = pool.MapReduce(CreateAndFillHists, 10, PoolUtils::ReduceObjects);; hist->DrawClone();; }; ```. Tutorials illustrating other usages of the new class TProcPool are available under tutorials/multicore. ## Language Bindings. ### Notebooks; We provided integration of ROOT with the Jupyter technology, integrating ROOT with Python Notebooks and providing a ROOT Kernel like functionality - de facto an enhanced C++ web based shell.

Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed.

Integrability,"Introduction; ============. Clang Thread Safety Analysis is a C++ language extension which warns about; potential race conditions in code. The analysis is completely static (i.e.; compile-time); there is no run-time overhead. The analysis is still; under active development, but it is mature enough to be deployed in an; industrial setting. It is being developed by Google, in collaboration with; CERT/SEI, and is used extensively in Google's internal code base. Thread safety analysis works very much like a type system for multi-threaded; programs. In addition to declaring the *type* of data (e.g. ``int``, ``float``,; etc.), the programmer can (optionally) declare how access to that data is; controlled in a multi-threaded environment. For example, if ``foo`` is; *guarded by* the mutex ``mu``, then the analysis will issue a warning whenever; a piece of code reads or writes to ``foo`` without first locking ``mu``.; Similarly, if there are particular routines that should only be called by; the GUI thread, then the analysis will warn if other threads call those; routines. Getting Started; ----------------. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""mutex.h"". class BankAccount {; private:; Mutex mu;; int balance GUARDED_BY(mu);. void depositImpl(int amount) {; balance += amount; // WARNING! Cannot write balance without locking mu.; }. void withdrawImpl(int amount) REQUIRES(mu) {; balance -= amount; // OK.

Failed to unlock mu. void transferFrom(BankAccount& b, int amount) {; mu.Lock();; b.withdrawImpl(amount); // WARNING! Calling withdrawImpl() requires locking b.mu.; depositImpl(amount); // OK. depositImpl() has no requirements.; mu.Unlock();; }; };. This example demonstrates the basic concepts behind the analysis. The; ``GUARDED_BY`` attribute declares that a thread must lock ``mu`` before it can; read or write to ``balance``, thus ensuring that ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:1032,rout,routines,1032,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,2,['rout'],['routines']

Integrability,"Itanium Name Demangler Library; ==============================. Introduction; ------------. This directory contains the generic itanium name demangler; library. The main purpose of the library is to demangle C++ symbols,; i.e. convert the string ""_Z1fv"" into ""f()"". You can also use the CRTP; base ManglingParser to perform some simple analysis on the mangled; name, or (in LLVM) use the opaque ItaniumPartialDemangler to query the; demangled AST. Why are there multiple copies of the this library in the source tree?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. The canonical sources are in libcxxabi/src/demangle and some of the; files are copied to llvm/include/llvm/Demangle. The simple reason for; this comes from before the monorepo, and both [sub]projects need to; demangle symbols, but neither can depend on each other. * libcxxabi needs the demangler to implement __cxa_demangle, which is; part of the itanium ABI spec. * LLVM needs a copy for a bunch of places, and cannot rely on the; system's __cxa_demangle because it a) might not be available (i.e.,; on Windows), and b) may not be up-to-date on the latest language; features. The copy of the demangler in LLVM has some extra stuff that aren't; needed in libcxxabi (ie, the MSVC demangler, ItaniumPartialDemangler),; which depend on the shared generic components. Despite these; differences, we want to keep the ""core"" generic demangling library; identical between both copies to simplify development and testing. If you're working on the generic library, then do the work first in; libcxxabi, then run libcxxabi/src/demangle/cp-to-llvm.sh. This; script takes as an optional argument the path to llvm, and copies the; changes you made to libcxxabi over. Note that this script just; blindly overwrites all changes to the generic library in llvm, so be; careful. Because the core demangler needs to work in libcxxabi, everything; needs to be declared in an anonymous namespace (see; DEMANGLE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN), an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt:833,depend,depend,833,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt,1,['depend'],['depend']

The job of ``classof`` is to dynamically determine whether an object of; a base class is in fact of a particular derived class. In order to; downcast a type ``Base`` to a type ``Derived``, there needs to be a; ``classof`` in ``Derived`` which will accept an object of type ``Base``. To be concrete, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c++. Shape *S = ...;; if (isa<Circle>(S)) {; /* do something ... */; }. The code of the ``isa<>`` test in this code will eventually boil; down---after template instantiation and some other machinery---to a; check roughly like ``Circle::classof(S)``. For more information, see; :ref:`classof-contract`. The argument to ``classof`` should always be an *ancestor* class because; the implementation has logic to allow and optimize away; upcasts/up-``isa<>``'s automatically. It is as though every class; ``Foo`` automatically has a ``classof`` like:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; [...]; template <class T>; static bool classof(const T *,; ::std::enable_if<; ::std::is_base_of<Foo, T>::value; >::type* = 0) { return true; }; [...]; };. Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a; ``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``,; and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum),; so this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need.

The example first asks for user input, namely the ratio of slit width; over slit distance, and the number of slits. After entering this; information, you should see the graphical output as is shown in Figure [2.1](#f21). This is a more complicated example than the ones we have seen before, so; spend some time analysing it carefully, you should have understood it; before continuing. Let us go through it in detail:. Lines *7-18* define the necessary functions in `C++` code, split into; three separate functions, as suggested by the problem considered. The; full interference pattern is given by the product of a function; depending on the ratio of the width and distance of the slits, and a; second one depending on the number of slits. More important for us here; is the definition of the interface of these functions to make them; usable for the ROOT class `TF1`: the first argument is the pointer to; *x*, the second one points to the array of parameters. The main program starts at line 21 with the definition of a function; `slits()` of type `void`. After asking for user input, a ROOT function; is defined using the C-type function given in the beginning. We can now; use all methods of the `TF1` class to control the behaviour of our; function -- nice, isn't it ?. If you like, you can easily extend the example to also plot the; interference pattern of a single slit, using function `double single`,; or of a grid with narrow slits, function `double nslit0`, in `TF1`; instances. Here, we used a macro, some sort of lightweight program, that the; interpreter distributed with ROOT, Cling, is able to execute.

For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline.

For example, to link with all LLVM libraries use; ``LINK_COMPONENTS = all``. ``LIBS``. To link dynamic libraries, add ``-l<library base name>`` to the ``LIBS``; variable. The LLVM build system will look in the same places for dynamic; libraries as it does for static libraries. For example, to link ``libsample.so``, you would have the following line in; your ``Makefile``:. .. code-block:: makefile. LIBS += -lsample. Note that ``LIBS`` must occur in the Makefile after the inclusion of; ``Makefile.common``. Miscellaneous Variables; -----------------------. ``CFLAGS`` & ``CPPFLAGS``. This variable can be used to add options to the C and C++ compiler,; respectively. It is typically used to add options that tell the compiler; the location of additional directories to search for header files. It is highly suggested that you append to ``CFLAGS`` and ``CPPFLAGS`` as; opposed to overwriting them. The LLVM ``Makefiles`` may already have; useful options in them that you may not want to overwrite. Placement of Object Code; ========================. The final location of built libraries and executables will depend upon whether; you do a ``Debug``, ``Release``, or ``Profile`` build. Libraries. All libraries (static and dynamic) will be stored in; ``PROJ_OBJ_ROOT/<type>/lib``, where *type* is ``Debug``, ``Release``, or; ``Profile`` for a debug, optimized, or profiled build, respectively.

This means that clients of LLVM can now reliably use; CMake to develop their own LLVM-based projects against an installed version of; LLVM regardless of how it was built. Here is a simple example of a CMakeLists.txt file that imports the LLVM libraries; and uses them to build a simple application ``simple-tool``. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(SimpleProject). find_package(LLVM REQUIRED CONFIG). message(STATUS ""Found LLVM ${LLVM_PACKAGE_VERSION}""); message(STATUS ""Using LLVMConfig.cmake in: ${LLVM_DIR}""). # Set your project compile flags.; # E.g. if using the C++ header files; # you will need to enable C++11 support; # for your compiler. include_directories(${LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS}); separate_arguments(LLVM_DEFINITIONS_LIST NATIVE_COMMAND ${LLVM_DEFINITIONS}); add_definitions(${LLVM_DEFINITIONS_LIST}). # Now build our tools; add_executable(simple-tool tool.cpp). # Find the libraries that correspond to the LLVM components; # that we wish to use; llvm_map_components_to_libnames(llvm_libs support core irreader). # Link against LLVM libraries; target_link_libraries(simple-tool ${llvm_libs}).

Integrability,"Manual Data Model Evolution Capabilities - the user documentation. 1. Overview. The automatic data model schema evolution implemented in ROOT makes it possible; to read back the serialized data object in the situation when the definition of; the classes those objects represent changed slightly (some of the data members were; removed or some new ones added). It is also possible to manually specify the rules; for more sophisticated data transformations done while reading to load the serialized; objects into data structures that changed quite significantly. ROOT provides two interface enabling users to specify the conversion rules. The; first way is to define a rule in the dictionary file and the second way is to insert; it to the TClass object using the C++ API. There are two types of conversion rules. The first of them, the normal rules, are; the ones that should be used in the most of the cases. They provide a buffered input; data and an address of the in-memory target object and allow user to specify the; conversion function mapping the data being read to the output format. The second type; of the rules, the raw rules, also provide the pointer to the target object but the; input is a raw TBuffer object containing the input data member declared as an input; to the rule. This type of a rule is provided mainly to handle the file format changes; that couldn't have been handled otherwise and in general should not be used unless there; is no other option. 2. The dictionaries. The most convenient place to specify the conversion rules is a dictionary. One can; do that either in CINT's LinkDef file or in the selection xml file being fed to genreflex.; The syntax of the rules is the following:. * For CINT dictionaries:. #pragma read \; sourceClass=""ClassA"" \; source=""double m_a; double m_b; double m_c"" \; version=""[4-5,7,9,12-]"" \; checksum=""[12345,123456]"" \; targetClass=""ClassB"" \; target=""m_x"" \; embed=""true"" \; include=""iostream,cstdlib"" \; code=""{m_x = onfile.m_a * onfil",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/DataModelEvolution.txt:579,interface,interface,579,io/doc/DataModelEvolution.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/DataModelEvolution.txt,2,['interface'],['interface']

Discussion; ----------. NSNumber literals only support literal scalar values after the ``'@'``.; Consequently, ``@INT_MAX`` works, but ``@INT_MIN`` does not, because; they are defined like this:. .. code-block:: objc. #define INT_MAX 2147483647 /* max value for an int */; #define INT_MIN (-2147483647-1) /* min value for an int */. The definition of ``INT_MIN`` is not a simple literal, but a; parenthesized expression. Parenthesized expressions are supported using; the `boxed expression <#objc_boxed_expressions>`_ syntax, which is; described in the next section. Because ``NSNumber`` does not currently support wrapping ``long double``; values, the use of a ``long double NSNumber`` literal (e.g.; ``@123.23L``) will be rejected by the compiler. Previously, the ``BOOL`` type was simply a typedef for ``signed char``,; and ``YES`` and ``NO`` were macros that expand to ``(BOOL)1`` and; ``(BOOL)0`` respectively. To support ``@YES`` and ``@NO`` expressions,; these macros are now defined using new language keywords in; ``<objc/objc.h>``:. .. code-block:: objc. #if __has_feature(objc_bool); #define YES __objc_yes; #define NO __objc_no; #else; #define YES ((BOOL)1); #define NO ((BOOL)0); #endif. The compiler implicitly converts ``__objc_yes`` and ``__objc_no`` to; ``(BOOL)1`` and ``(BOOL)0``. The keywords are used to disambiguate; ``BOOL`` and integer literals. Objective-C++ also supports ``@true`` and ``@false`` expressions, which; are equivalent to ``@YES`` and ``@NO``. Boxed Expressions; =================.

The same functionality can be implemented by calling `RooAbsData::reduce` on the Markov Chain's `RooDataSet*` (obtained using `MarkovChain::GetAsConstDataSet`) and then obtaining its binned clone(for `RooDataHist`). An example in Python would be:. ```py; mcInt = mc.GetInterval() # Obtain the MCMCInterval from a configured MCMCCalculator; mkc = mcInt.GetChain() # Obtain the MarkovChain; mkcData = mkc.GetAsConstDataSet(); mcIntParams = mcInt.GetParameters(). chainDataset = mkcData.reduce(SelectVars=mcIntParams, EventRange=(mcInt.GetNumBurnInSteps(), mkc.Size())); chainDataHist = chainDataset.binnedClone(); ```. * The following methods related to the RooAbsArg interface are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.; They should be replaced with the suitable alternatives interfaces:. - `RooAbsArg::getDependents()`: use `getObservables()`; - `RooAbsArg::dependentOverlaps()`: use `observableOverlaps()`; - `RooAbsArg::checkDependents()`: use `checkObservables()`; - `RooAbsArg::recursiveCheckDependents()`: use `recursiveCheckObservables()`. ## Graphics Backends. ## 2D Graphics Libraries. ## 3D Graphics Libraries. ## Geometry Libraries. ## Database Libraries. ## Networking Libraries. ## GUI Libraries. ## Montecarlo Libraries. ## PROOF Libraries. ## PyROOT. ### Typesafe `TTree::SetBranchAddress()` for array inputs.

I think your point was that making all types explicit improves clarity; and readability. I agree to some extent, but it also comes at the cost; of verbosity. And when the types are obvious from people's experience; (e.g., in the br instruction), it doesn't seem to help as much. o On reflection, I really like your idea of having the two different switch; types (even though they encode implementation techniques rather than; semantics).

The emit operation takes a ``MaterializationResponsibility`` object and an; instance of your program representation and materializes it, usually by compiling it and handing; the resulting object off to an ``ObjectLinkingLayer``. Your custom ``MaterializationUnit`` will have two operations: ``materialize`` and ``discard``. The; ``materialize`` function will be called for you when any symbol provided by the unit is looked up,; and it should just call the ``emit`` function on your layer, passing in the given; ``MaterializationResponsibility`` and the wrapped program representation. The ``discard`` function; will be called if some weak symbol provided by your unit is not needed (because the JIT found an; overriding definition). You can use this to drop your definition early, or just ignore it and let; the linker drops the definition later. Here is an example of an ASTLayer:. .. code-block:: c++. // ...

When such a message is sent to an; object, the object's lifetime will be extended until at least the earliest of:. * the last use of the returned pointer, or any pointer derived from it, in the; calling function or; * the autorelease pool is restored to a previous state. .. admonition:: Rationale. Rationale: not all memory and resources are managed with reference counts; it; is common for objects to manage private resources in their own, private way.; Typically these resources are completely encapsulated within the object, but; some classes offer their users direct access for efficiency. If ARC is not; aware of methods that return such ""interior"" pointers, its optimizations can; cause the owning object to be reclaimed too soon. This attribute informs ARC; that it must tread lightly. The extension rules are somewhat intentionally vague. The autorelease pool; limit is there to permit a simple implementation to simply retain and; autorelease the receiver. The other limit permits some amount of; optimization.

Integrability,"RNTuple Code Architecture; =========================. > This document is meant for ROOT developers. It provides background information on the RNTuple code design and behavior. > The RNTuple code uses the nomenclature from the [RNTuple format specification](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/BinaryFormatSpecification.md) (e.g. ""field"", ""column"", ""anchor"", etc.). General Principles; ------------------. The RNTuple classes provide the functionality to read, write, and describe RNTuple datasets.; The core classes, such as `RNTupleReader` and `RNTupleWriter`, are part of the RNTuple library.; Additional tools, such as the `RNTupleImporter` and the `RNTupleInspector`, are part of the RNTupleUtils library,; which depends on the RNTuple library. The RNTuple classes are organized in layers:; the storage layer, the primitives layer, the logical layer and the event iteration layer.; Most classes in the storage layer and the primitives layer are in the `ROOT::Internal` namespace (non-public interfaces),; with the notable exception of the descriptor classes (`RNTupleDescriptor`, `RFieldDescriptor`, etc.).; Most classes in the upper layers provide public interfaces. | Layer | Description | Example of classes |; |------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|; | Storage | Read and write pages (physical: file, object store; virtual: e.g. buffered) | RPage{Source,Sink}, RNTupleDescriptor, RClusterPool |; | Primitives | Storage-backed columns of simple types | RColumn, RColumnElement, RPage |; | Logical | Mapping of C++ types onto columns | RField, RNTupleModel, REntry |; | Iteration | Reading and writing events / properties | RNTuple{Reader,Writer}, RNTupleView, RNTupleDS (RDataFrame) |; | Tooling | Higher-level, RNTuple related utility classes | RNTupleMerger, RNTupleImporter, RNTupleInspector |.

Integrability,"RNTuple Introduction; ====================. RNTuple (for n-tuple and nested tuple) is the experimental evolution of TTree columnar data storage. RNTuple introduces; new interfaces that aim to be more robust. In particular, the new interfaces are type-safe through the use of; templates, and the ownership is well-defined through the use of smart pointers. For instance. tree->Branch(""px"", &Category, ""px/F"");. becomes. auto px = model->MakeField<float>(""px"");; // px is std::shared_ptr<float>. The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which re",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:169,interface,interfaces,169,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,2,['interface'],['interfaces']

To use QL; select a file icon in the Finder and hit the space bar. For all file types; supported by QL you will get a window showing the file content, for file types; not supported you will get a generic window showing some basic file info. The idea of QL is that file content can be shown without the heavy application; startup process. Generating a QL view of a ROOT file depends on the size of the; file and number of keys, but generally it is a quick operation. Get the binary for the ROOTQL plugin from:. ftp://root.cern/root/ROOTQL.tgz. To install the plugin, after untarring the above file, just drag the; ROOTQL.qlgenerator icon to either /Library/QuickLook or to ~/Library/QuickLook.; You may have to create that folder if it does not exist. Once installed; you may have to refresh the QL plugin cache by executing:; /usr/bin/qlmanage -r. To build from source, get it from git using:. git clone http://root.cern/git/root.git root; cd root/misc/rootql. Open the ROOTQL project in Xcode and click on ""Build"" (make sure the Active; Build Configuration is set to ""Release"").

The legacy ```TLockGuard``` and ```R__LOCKGUARD``` use the write lock.; - Improved scaling of TROOT::RecursiveRemove in the case of large collection.; - Added a thread safe mode for the following ROOT collections: THashList, THashTable, TList and TObjArray. When ROOT's thread safe mode is enabled and the collection is set to use internal locks by calling:; ```; collection->UseRWLock();; ```; all operations on the collection will take the read or write lock when needed, currently they shared the global lock (ROOT::gCoreMutex). ### Interpreter. - cling's LLVM is upgraded to version 5.0; - All of cling's patches to llvm have been upstreamed.; - The interpreter-related lock is now locking only the compilation step, not the execution step.

Comments; that do not start with `LLVM-MCA-` are ignored by :program `llvm-mca`. An instruction (a MCInst) is added to an InstrumentRegion R only; if its location is in range [R.RangeStart, R.RangeEnd]. On RISCV targets, vector instructions have different behaviour depending; on the LMUL. Code can be instrumented with a comment that takes the; following form:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-RISCV-LMUL <M1|M2|M4|M8|MF2|MF4|MF8>. The RISCV InstrumentManager will override the schedule class for vector; instructions to use the scheduling behaviour of its pseudo-instruction; which is LMUL dependent. It makes sense to place RISCV instrument; comments directly after `vset{i}vl{i}` instructions, although; they can be placed anywhere in the program. Example of program with no call to `vset{i}vl{i}`:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-RISCV-LMUL M2; vadd.vv v2, v2, v2. Example of program with call to `vset{i}vl{i}`:. .. code-block:: none. vsetvli zero, a0, e8, m1, tu, mu; # LLVM-MCA-RISCV-LMUL M1; vadd.vv v2, v2, v2.

How to use ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext; -------------------------------------------------. ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext are wrappers around Modules and; LLVMContexts respectively. A ThreadSafeModule is a pair of a; std::unique_ptr<Module> and a (possibly shared) ThreadSafeContext value. A; ThreadSafeContext is a pair of a std::unique_ptr<LLVMContext> and a lock.; This design serves two purposes: providing a locking scheme and lifetime; management for LLVMContexts. The ThreadSafeContext may be locked to prevent; accidental concurrent access by two Modules that use the same LLVMContext.; The underlying LLVMContext is freed once all ThreadSafeContext values pointing; to it are destroyed, allowing the context memory to be reclaimed as soon as; the Modules referring to it are destroyed. ThreadSafeContexts can be explicitly constructed from a; std::unique_ptr<LLVMContext>:. .. code-block:: c++. ThreadSafeContext TSCtx(std::make_unique<LLVMContext>());. ThreadSafeModules can be constructed from a pair of a std::unique_ptr<Module>; and a ThreadSafeContext value.

Pdf components dependent on these alone are added to a subsidiary likelihood term.; - `ExternalConstraints`: Initialized with a `RooArgSet` of external constraint pdfs, i.e. constraints not necessarily in the pdf itself.

Can be used instead of or in addition to a `GlobalObservables` argument.

Copy assignment for RooAbsArgs was implemented in an unexpected and; inconsistent way. While one would expect that the copy assignment is copying; the object, it said in the documentation of `RooAbsArg::operator=` that it will; ""assign all boolean and string properties of the original bject. Transient; properties and client-server links are not assigned."" This contradicted with; the implementation, where the server links were actually copied too.; Furthermore, in `RooAbsRealLValue`, the assigment operator was overloaded by a; function that only assigns the value of another `RooAbsReal`. With all these inconsistencies, it was deemed safer to disable copy assignment; of RooAbsArgs from now on. ### RooBrowser: a graphical user interface for workspace exploration, visualization, and analysis. This experimental new feature utilises the technology from ROOT's familiar `TBrowser` in order to create an interface for graphically exploring and visualizing the content of a workspace, as well as perform basic fitting operations with the models and datasets. ![Demonstration of RooBrowser using json workspace from the roofit tutorials directory](RooBrowser.png). ### Removal of deprecated HistFactory functionality. #### Removal of HistoToWorkspaceFactory (non-Fast version).

Some helpers for handling the command line interface are available in; ``include/llvm/FuzzMutate/FuzzerCLI.h``, including functions to parse command; line options in a consistent way and to implement standalone main functions so; your fuzzer can be built and tested when not built against libFuzzer. There is also some handling of the CMake config for fuzzers, where you should; use the ``add_llvm_fuzzer`` to set up fuzzer targets. This function works; similarly to functions such as ``add_llvm_tool``, but they take care of linking; to LibFuzzer when appropriate and can be passed the ``DUMMY_MAIN`` argument to; enable standalone testing.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst:9739,interface,interface,9739,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

For network communication, we have a specialized **`TBuffer`**,; a descendant of **`TBuffer`** called **`TMessage`**. In the following; example, we create a **`TMessage`** with the intention to store an; object, hence the constant `kMESS_OBJECT` in the constructor.

On the receiving end (in our case the server side), we write a while; loop to wait and receive a message with a histogram. Once we have a; message, we call `TMessage::ReadObject`, which returns a pointer to; **`TObject`**. We have to cast it to a **`TH1`** pointer, and now we; have a histogram.

It comes with an analytical integral and a generator function,; which make it superior (faster and more accurate) than implementing it manually with an interpreted/compiled formula. ### HistFactory; hist2workspace performance optimisations. For a large, ATLAS-style Higgs-->bb workspace with > 100 systematic uncertainties and more than 10 channels, the run time for converting histograms to a fit model decreases by a factor 11 to 12. ### Faster, STL-like Collections in RooFit; RooFit's collections `RooArgSet` and `RooArgList` have been made more STL-like. The underlying implementation used to be the `RooLinkedList`, but now both collections work with `std::vector`. The collections have an STL-like interface concerning iterators such that iterations over the two collections that looked like; ```; TIterator* depIter = intDepList.createIterator() ;; RooAbsArg* arg;; while((arg=(RooAbsArg*)depIter->Next())) {; ...; }; delete depIter;; ```; now look like:; ```; for (auto arg : intDepList) {; ...; }; ```; Depending on how many elements are iterated, RooFit will be between 10 and 20% faster if the new iterators are used. Heavily using old iterators might slow it down by 5 to 10%. Iterators in key classes have been updated, such that many workflows in RooFit are 10 - 20% faster. #### Legacy iterators; The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops. **Important caveat**:; The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)!

Integrability,"T. ### Installation. For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version; of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations.; We hope that this will become the default later. To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):. ```; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; ```. This configures and builds ROOT using `/usr/lib/libpthread.so` as the; `Pthread` library, and defines `R__THREAD`. This enables the thread specific treatment of *`gPad`*, and creates; `$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.`. Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate; ROOT keyword for your platform. ### Classes. **`TThread`** class implements threads . The platform dependent; implementation is in the **`TThreadImp`** class and its descendant; classes (e.g. **`TPosixThread`** ). **`TMutex`** class implements `mutex` locks. A mutex is a mutually; exclusive lock. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** class and its descendant classes (e.g.; **`TPosixMutex`**). **`TCondition`** class implements a condition variable. Use a condition; variable to signal threads. The platform dependent implementation is in; the **`TConditionImp`** and **`TPosixCondition`** classes . **`TSemaphore`** class implements a counting semaphore. Use a semaphore; to synchronize threads. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** and **`TConditionImp`** classes. ### TThread for Pedestrians. To run a thread in ROOT, follow these steps:. 1. Initialization. Add these lines to your `rootlogon.C`:. ``` {.cpp}; {; ...; // The next line may be unnecessary on some platforms; gSystem->Load(""/usr/lib/libpthread.so"");; gSystem->Load(""$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so"");; ...; }; ```.

The second one uses the Gauss Legendre quadrature formula. It is used by the TF1::IntegralFast method.; These classes implement both the same virtual interface as the adaptive integration methods provided by the MathMore library.

He needs to create the; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` class for integrating one-dimensional functions and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` for multi-dimensional functions.; Through the ROOT Plug-In Manager, the user can initialize `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` or `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` with; any of the concrete integration classes without dealing with them directly.; These two classes provide the same interface as in `VirtualIntegratorOneDim` and `VirtualIntegratorMultiDim`, but with the possibility to choose in the constructor,; which method will be used to perform the integration. The method to set the function to be integrated, must be of the function interface type described before.; `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDimFunction` is used for `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim` and; The only difference between the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` resides; in the dimensionality of that function and some specific that will be seen afterwards for the one dimensional one. ![ROOT::Math Numerical Integrator classes](pictures/Integr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:49028,integrat,integrating,49028,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

For user-defined classes as well as sets and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`.; Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries.; See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple.; The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source.; A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features; ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:; - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends; - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain; - An interface for bulk writing; - Meta-data: RNTuple-specific and user-provided meta-data storage, such as file provenance, scale factors, or varied columns; - C library interface; - S3 storage backend (page source / page sink). Semantics of Reading Non-Trivial Objects; ========================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members.; Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members.; However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:; it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below).

Profile histograms are in many cases an elegant replacement of; two-dimensional histograms. The relationship of two quantities X and Y; can be visualized by a two-dimensional histogram or a scatter-plot;; its representation is not particularly satisfactory, except for sparse; data. If Y is an unknown [but single-valued] function of X, it can be; displayed by a profile histogram with much better precision than by a; scatter-plot. Profile histograms display the mean value of Y and its; RMS for each bin in X. The following shows the contents; [capital letters] and the values shown in the graphics [small letters]; of the elements for bin j. When you fill a profile histogram with; **`TProfile`**`.Fill(x,y)` :. - `H[j]` will contain for each bin `j` the sum of the y values for; this bin. - `L[j]` contains the number of entries in the bin `j`. - `e[j]` or `s[j]` will be the resulting error depending on the; selected option.

In the special case where `s[j]` is zero, when there is only one entry; per bin, `e[j]` is computed from the average of the `s[j]` for all; bins.

Integrability,"To delete the object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; ```. You should see the print out from its destructor. Setting the pointer; to zero afterwards is not strictly necessary (and Cling does it; automatically), but the object is no more accessible, and any attempt; to use the pointer again will, as has already been stated, cause; grief. So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In; C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost; compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly; futile to do something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; ```. Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you; will not see the destructor message. As explained in the Script; lesson, you can load in compound statements, which would be a bit; pointless if everything disappeared as soon as it was loaded! Instead,; to reset the stack you have to type:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```. This sends the Reset message via the global pointer to the ROOT; object, which, amongst its many roles, acts as a resource manager.; Start ROOT again and type in the following:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(4.,5.,-6.);; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```. You will see that this deletes the first object but not the second. We; have also painted ourselves into a corner, as `my_objptr` was also on; the stack. This command will fail. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Cling no longer knows what `my_objptr` is.

Every type with RNTuple I/O supported has a corresponding RField<T> template specialization.; Complex types are composed of fields and sub fields.; E.g., a `struct` is represented by a parent field for the `struct` itself and a subfield for every member of the `struct`.; Fields of complex types have type-erased versions in addition to the templated ones (e.g., `RVectorField`, `RClassField`).; In this way, fields can be constructed even if the type information is only available at runtime.; To this end, `RFieldBase::Create()` creates an `RField` object from a type string. On the ""in-memory"" side, fields can construct and destroy objects of their wrapped type; (cf. `CreateValue()`, `CreateObject()`, `GetDeleter()` methods).; Existing objects in memory can be bound to fields (cf. `BindValue()` method). On the ""on-disk"" side, fields know about the possible column representations of their wrapped type.; Upon connecting a field to a page source or page sink,; fields create `RColumn` objects and register them with the page source/sink.; When reading and writing data, the field maps the in-memory information of an object to read/write calls on its columns.; For instance, when writing a `std::vector<float>`,; the field writes to an index column (storing information about the size of the vector).; Its subfield writes the actual values to a float column. During its lifetime, a field undergoes the following possible state transitions:; ```; [*] --> Unconnected --> ConnectedToSink ----; | | |; | --> ConnectedToSource ---> [*]; | |; -------------------------------; ```.

Integrability,"When and why was Cling developed?; ---------------------------------. Cling was first released in 2014 as the interactive, C++ interpreter in; ROOT. `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_ is an open-source program written primarily; in C++, developed by research groups in high-energy physics including `CERN; <https://home.cern/>`_, `FERMILAB <https://www.fnal.gov/>`_ and `Princeton; <https://www.princeton.edu/>`_. ROOT is nowadays used by most high-energy; physics experiments. CERN is an European research organization that operates the; largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Its experiments collect; petabytes of data per year to be serialized, analyzed, and visualized as C++; objects. In this framework, Cling was developed with the aim to facilitate the; processing of scientific data in the field of high-energy physics . Cling is a; core component of ROOT: it provides essential functionality for the analysis of; vast amounts of very complex data produced by the experimental high-energy; physics community by enabling (1) interactive exploration in C++, (2) dynamic; interoperability (see `cppyy <https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, an; automatic, runtime Python/C++ binder), and (3) rapid prototyping capabilities.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst:1082,interoperab,interoperability,1082,interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst,1,['interoperab'],['interoperability']
Integrability,"Why interpreting C++ with Cling?; -----------------------------------. 1. **Learning C++:**; ; One use case of Cling is to aid the C++ learning process. Offering imediate; feedback the user can easily get familiar with the structures and spelling of; the language. 2. **Creating scripts:**; ; The power of an interpreter lays as well in the compactness and ease of; repeatedly running a small snippet of code - aka a script. This can be done in; Cling by inserting the bash-like style line:. .. code:: bash; ; #!/usr/bin/cling; ; 3. **Rapid Application Development (RAD):**. Cling can be used successfully for Rapid Application Development allowing for; prototyping and proofs of concept taking advantage of dynamicity and feedback; during the implementation process. 4. **Runtime-Generated Code**. Sometime it's convenient to create code as a reaction to input; (user/network/configuration). Runtime-generated code can interface with C++; libraries. 5. **Embedding Cling:**. The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed; Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program; has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass; command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from; any anywhere within the application. For compilation and linkage the application needs the path to the Clang and LLVM; libraries and the invocation is order dependent since the linker cannot do; backward searches. .. code:: bash. g++ embedcling.cxx -std=c++11 -L/usr/local/lib; -lclingInterpreter -lclingUtils ; -lclangFrontend -lclangSerialization -lclangParse -lclangSema ; -lclangAnalysis -lclangEdit -lclangLex -lclangDriver -lclangCodeGen ; -lclangBasic -lclangAST ; `llvm-config ; --libs bitwriter mcjit orcjit native option ; ipo profiledata instrumentation objcarcopts` ; -lz -pthread -ldl -ltinfo ; -o embedcling; .

The Lexer and Preprocessor Library; ==================================. The Lexer library contains several tightly-connected classes that are involved; with the nasty process of lexing and preprocessing C source code. The main; interface to this library for outside clients is the large ``Preprocessor``; class. It contains the various pieces of state that are required to coherently; read tokens out of a translation unit. The core interface to the ``Preprocessor`` object (once it is set up) is the; ``Preprocessor::Lex`` method, which returns the next :ref:`Token <Token>` from; the preprocessor stream. There are two types of token providers that the; preprocessor is capable of reading from: a buffer lexer (provided by the; :ref:`Lexer <Lexer>` class) and a buffered token stream (provided by the; :ref:`TokenLexer <TokenLexer>` class). .. _Token:. The Token class; ---------------. The ``Token`` class is used to represent a single lexed token. Tokens are; intended to be used by the lexer/preprocess and parser libraries, but are not; intended to live beyond them (for example, they should not live in the ASTs). Tokens most often live on the stack (or some other location that is efficient; to access) as the parser is running, but occasionally do get buffered up. For; example, macro definitions are stored as a series of tokens, and the C++; front-end periodically needs to buffer tokens up for tentative parsing and; various pieces of look-ahead. As such, the size of a ``Token`` matters.

Arguments to the diagnostic are numbered according to how they are specified by; the C++ code that :ref:`produces them <internals-producing-diag>`, and are; referenced by ``%0`` .. ``%9``. If you have more than 10 arguments to your; diagnostic, you are doing something wrong :). Unlike ``printf``, there is no; requirement that arguments to the diagnostic end up in the output in the same; order as they are specified, you could have a format string with ""``%1 %0``""; that swaps them, for example. The text in between the percent and digit are; formatting instructions. If there are no instructions, the argument is just; turned into a string and substituted in. Here are some ""best practices"" for writing the English format string:. * Keep the string short. It should ideally fit in the 80 column limit of the; ``DiagnosticKinds.td`` file. This avoids the diagnostic wrapping when; printed, and forces you to think about the important point you are conveying; with the diagnostic.; * Take advantage of location information. The user will be able to see the; line and location of the caret, so you don't need to tell them that the; problem is with the 4th argument to the function: just point to it.; * Do not capitalize the diagnostic string, and do not end it with a period.; * If you need to quote something in the diagnostic string, use single quotes. Diagnostics should never take random English strings as arguments: you; shouldn't use ""``you have a problem with %0``"" and pass in things like ""``your; argument``"" or ""``your return value``"" as arguments. Doing this prevents; :ref:`translating <internals-diag-translation>` the Clang diagnostics to other; languages (because they'll get random English words in their otherwise; localized diagnostic).

For more difficult problems the full FOAM may be better. ### How to run application programs ?. The application program can be run in two modes: it can be simply; interpreted by CLING or compiled. The first method is simpler but; results in slower execution. The second method employs ACLiC -; The Automatic Compiler of Libraries, which automatizes the; process of compilation and linking. In $(ROOTSYS)/tutorials there are 3 demonstration programs:. #### foam_kanwa.C; is a simple example how to run FOAM in interactive; mode.

As this binding is integrated into the ROOT installation, you need to; enable the use of the binding at the configure point of the ROOT; installation. This can be done like so:. ~~~ {.cpp}; ./configure --enable-gdml; ~~~. On doing this the libraries will be built by issuing the standard ROOT; make command. The GDML to TGeo converter uses the TXMLEngine to parse; the GDML files. This XML parser is a DOM parser and returns the DOM; tree to the class TGDMLParse. This class then interprets the GDML file; and adds the bindings in their TGeo equivalent. The GDML schema is fully supported with a few exceptions:. - Replica Volumes are not supported; - Loops are not supported; - Matrices are not supported. These will hopefully be added in the near future. Once you have enabled GDML in the configure process for ROOT, to import; a GDML file, this can be done using TGeoManager::Import.

Currently, the ""General"" tab provides; user interface elements for setting the fit function, fit method and; different fit, draw, print options.; The ""Minimization tab"" provides the option to set the Minimizer to use in the fit and; its specific options. The fit panel is a modeless dialog, i.e. when opened, it does not; prevent users from interacting with other windows. Its first prototype; is a singleton application. When the Fit Panel is activated, users can; select an object for fitting in the usual way, i.e. by left-mouse; click on it.

Everything drawn in a ROOT canvas is an object. There are classes for; all objects, and they fall into hierarchies. In addition, the ROOT has; fully cross-platform GUI classes and provides all standard components; for an application environment with common ‘look and feel'. The; object-oriented, event-driven programming model supports the modern; signals/slots communication mechanism. It handles user interface actions; and allows total independence of interacting objects and classes. This; mechanism uses the ROOT dictionary information and the Cling the C++; Interpreter to connect signals to slots methods. Therefore, all necessary elements for an object-oriented editor design; are in place. The editor complexity can be reduced by splitting it into; discrete units of so-called *`object`* *`editors`*. Any object editor; provides an object specific GUI. The main purpose of the ROOT graphics; editor is the organization of the object editors' appearance and the; task sequence between them. ### Object Editors. Every object editor follows a simple naming convention: to have as a; name the object class name concatenated with ‘*`Editor`*' (e.g. for; **`TGraph`** objects the object editor is **`TGraphEditor`**). Thanks to; the signals/slots communication mechanism and to the method; `DistancetoPrimitive()` that computes a ‘‘distance'' to an object from; the mouse position, it was possible to implement a signal method of the; canvas that says which is the selected object and to which pad it; belongs. Having this information the graphics editor loads the; corresponding object editor and the user interface is ready for use.; This way after a click on ‘axis'—the axis editor is active; a click on a; ‘pad' activates the pad editor, etc. The algorithm in use is simple and is based on the object-",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/gui/ged/doc/index.md:596,interface,interface,596,gui/ged/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/gui/ged/doc/index.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Tests are being conducted continuously to ensure correctness of the results, but the interfaces and the instructions on how to use might change. ### Purpose; While fitting, a significant amount of time and processing power is spent on computing the probability function for every event and PDF involved in the fitting model. To speed up this process, roofit can use the computation functions provided in this library. The functions provided here process whole data arrays (batches) instead of a single event at a time, as in the legacy evaluate() function in roofit. In addition, the code is written in a manner that allows for compiler optimizations, notably auto-vectorization. This library is compiled multiple times for different [vector instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and the optimal code is executed during runtime, as a result of an automatic hardware detection mechanism that this library contains. **As a result, fits can benefit by a speedup of 3x-16x.**. As of ROOT v6.26, RooBatchComputes also provides multithread and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) instances of the computation functions, resulting in even greater improvements for fitting times. ### How to use; This library is an internal component of RooFit, so users are not supposed to actively interact with it. Instead, they can benefit from significantly faster times for fitting by calling `fitTo()` and providing a `BatchMode(""cpu"")` or a `BatchMode(""cuda"")` option.; ``` {.cpp}; // fit using the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cpu""));. //",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md:465,interface,interfaces,465,roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

When using `RooFit`, statistical models can be conveniently handled and; stored as a `RooWorkspace`. However, for the sake of interoperability; with other statistical frameworks, and also ease of manipulation, it; may be useful to store statistical models in text form. This library; sets out to achieve exactly that, exporting to and importing from JSON; and YML. ### Backend. The default backend for this is the `nlohmann` JSON implementation,; which ships with ROOT as a builtin dependency and will import from and; export to JSON. Alternatively, the RapidYAML (`RYML`) implementation; can be used to also import from and export to YML. This implementation; can be selected at compile time with the `cmake` flag; `roofit_hs3_ryml`. ### Usage. The main class providing import from and export to JSON and YML is the; RooJSONFactoryWSTool. ### Open-world philosophy. One of the most challenging aspects of providing serialization and; deserialization for `RooFit` is the fact that `RooFit` follows an; ""open-world"" philosophy with respect to the functions and pdfs it can; handle. Over the years, `RooFit` has also accumulated a significant; number of different pre-implemented functions and pdfs. What is more,; you can easily create your own `RooFit` function by inheriting from; `RooAbsReal` or your own `RooFit` pdf by inheriting from; `RooAbsPdf`. This means that feature-complete serialization and; deserialization to and from JSON and YML will probably never be fully; achieved. However, this may not impede your usage of this library, as; it was written in such a way as to allow users (that is",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md:525,interoperab,interoperability,525,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,2,"['depend', 'interoperab']","['dependency', 'interoperability']"

If the type is qualified with ``__unsafe_unretained``, the semantics; of the containing aggregate are unchanged from the semantics of an unqualified type in a non-ARC mode. If the type is qualified with ``__autoreleasing``, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, if the type is nontrivially ownership-qualified, additional rules apply. Both Objective-C and Objective-C++ support nontrivially ownership-qualified; fields. Due to formal differences between the standards, the formal; treatment is different; however, the basic language model is intended to; be the same for identical code. .. admonition:: Rationale. Permitting ``__strong`` and ``__weak`` references in aggregate types; allows programmers to take advantage of the normal language tools of; C and C++ while still automatically managing memory. While it is; usually simpler and more idiomatic to use Objective-C objects for; secondary data structures, doing so can introduce extra allocation; and message-send overhead, which can cause to unacceptable; performance. Using structs can resolve some of this tension. ``__autoreleasing`` is forbidden because it is treacherous to rely; on autoreleases as an ownership tool outside of a function-local; contexts. Earlier releases of Clang permitted ``__strong`` and ``__weak`` only; references in Objective-C++ classes, not in Objective-C. This; restriction was an undesirable short-term constraint arising from the; complexity of adding support for non-trivial struct types to C. In Objective-C++, nontrivially ownership-qualified types are treated; for nearly all purposes as if they were class types with non-trivial; default constructors, copy constructors, move constructors, copy assignment; operators, move assignment operators, and destructors.

Integrability,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Support for languages which allow unmanaged pointers to garbage collected; objects (i.e. pass a pointer to an object to a C routine) in the abstract; machine model. At the moment, the best idea on how to approach this; involves an intrinsic or opaque function which hides the connection between; the reference value and the raw pointer. The problem is that having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times. There's; no immediate plans to make changes due to this, but alternate models may be; explored in the future. Relocations Along Exceptional Edges; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Flags that control numerical code; ---------------------------------. If you're using GPUs, you probably care about making numerical code run fast.; GPU hardware allows for more control over numerical operations than most CPUs,; but this results in more compiler options for you to juggle. Flags you may wish to tweak include:. * ``-ffp-contract={on,off,fast}`` (defaults to ``fast`` on host and device when; compiling CUDA) Controls whether the compiler emits fused multiply-add; operations. * ``off``: never emit fma operations, and prevent ptxas from fusing multiply; and add instructions.; * ``on``: fuse multiplies and adds within a single statement, but never; across statements (C11 semantics). Prevent ptxas from fusing other; multiplies and adds.; * ``fast``: fuse multiplies and adds wherever profitable, even across; statements. Doesn't prevent ptxas from fusing additional multiplies and; adds. Fused multiply-add instructions can be much faster than the unfused; equivalents, but because the intermediate result in an fma is not rounded,; this flag can affect numerical code. * ``-fcuda-flush-denormals-to-zero`` (default: off) When this is enabled,; floating point operations may flush `denormal; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number>`_ inputs and/or outputs to 0.; Operations on denormal numbers are often much slower than the same operations; on normal numbers. * ``-fcuda-approx-tran",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst:4177,contract,contract,4177,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,1,['contract'],['contract']

Up to now we have seen how to manipulate input read from ASCII files.; ROOT offers the possibility to do much better than that, with its own; n-tuple classes. Among the many advantages provided by these classes one; could cite. - Optimised disk I/O. - Possibility to store many n-tuple rows. - Write the n-tuples in ROOT files. - Interactive inspection with `TBrowser`. - Store not only numbers, but also *objects* in the columns. In this section we will discuss briefly the `TNtuple` class, which is a; simplified version of the `TTree` class. A ROOT `TNtuple` object can; store rows of float entries. Let's tackle the problem according to the; usual strategy commenting a minimal example. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_ntuple_to_file.C; ```. This data written to this example n-tuple represents, in the statistical; sense, three independent variables (Potential or Voltage, Pressure and; Temperature), and one variable (Current) which depends on the others; according to very simple laws, and an additional Gaussian smearing. This; set of variables mimics a measurement of an electrical resistance while; varying pressure and temperature. Imagine your task now consists in finding the relations among the; variables -- of course without knowing the code used to generate them.; You will see that the possibilities of the `NTuple` class enable you to; perform this analysis task. Open the ROOT file (`cond_data.root`); written by the macro above in an interactive session and use a; `TBrowser` to interactively inspect it:. ``` {.cpp}; root[0] TBrowser b; ```; You find the columns of your n-tuple written as *leafs*.

Integrability,"_strong`` local variables may be released as soon as the value in; the variable is no longer being used: either the variable stops; being used completely or a new value is stored in the variable. The intent of the third rule is to say that return values may be; released after they've been used. A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value.

Relationship to other ROOT components; -------------------------------------. The RNTuple classes have the following relationship to other parts of ROOT. The RNTuple classes use core ROOT infrastructure classes, such as error handling and logging.; When necessary, RNTuple uses a `TFile` for reading and writing.; The cases of writing to a local file and reading from a local file, a file from XRootD or from HTTP, do _not_ require `TFile`.; For these cases, RNTuple depends on the `RRawFile` class and its XRootD and Davix plugins. For user-defined classes as well as sets and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`.; Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries.; See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple.; The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source.; A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features; ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:; - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends; - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain; - An interface for bulk writing; - M",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md:28802,depend,depends,28802,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"` is the TTree drawing classes. - `libTreeViewer` is the graphical TTree query interface. #### Library Dependencies. ![ROOT libraries dependencies](pictures/03000005.png). The libraries are designed and organized to minimize dependencies,; such that you can load just enough code for the task at hand rather; than having to load all libraries or one monolithic chunk. The core; library (`libCore.so`) contains the essentials; it is a part of all; ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made; up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes,; operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for; compression of the ROOT files. The Cling library (`libCling.so`) is also needed in all ROOT; applications, and even by `libCore`. A; program referencing only **`TObject`** only needs `libCore`;; `libCling` will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write; ROOT objects one also has to load `libRIO`. As one would expect, none of that; depends on graphics or the GUI. Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether; you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is; defined in a library. #### Linktime Library Dependencies. When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:16852,depend,depends,16852,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

The gradient results; are stored in a `_result` parameter in the same order as `x` and `y` were; specified. Namely, the result of `x` is stored in `_result[0]` and the result; of `y` in `_result[1]`. If we invert the arguments specified in the string to; `clad::gradient(f, ""y, x"")` the results will be stored inversely.; * Enable recursive differentiation.; * Support single- and multi-dimensional arrays -- works for arrays with constant; size like `double A[] = {1, 2, 3};`, `double A[3];` or `double A[1][2][3][4];`. ## RooFit Libraries; ### RooJohnson PDF; The Johnson SU PDF has been added to RooFit.

The library where this code can be found is `libROOTDataFrame`. This new library is included in the list provided by `root-config --libs`.; - The `TArrayBranch` class has been removed and replaced by the more powerful `RVec` (see the `New features` section for more details).; - All `RDataFrame` tutorials are now prefixed with `df` rather than `tdf`.; - Histograms and profiles returned by RDataFrame (e.g. by a Histo1D action) are now not associated to a ROOT directory (their fDirectory is a nullptr).; The following still works as expected:; ```; auto h = tdf.Histo1D(""x"");; TFile f(fname, ""RECREATE"");; h->Write(); // event loop is run here and h is written to the TFile f; ```. #### New features; - The TDataSource interface changed. The `TDataSource::SetEntry` method now returns a boolean. If true the entry is processed within the event loop managed by the tdf, skipped otherwise.; - The TLazyDS data source has been added. It allows to create a source starting from ResultProxies to vectors.; - `TDataFrameInterface<T>::Report` returns a `TCutflowReport` object which can be inspected programmatically.; - Add `Aggregate` action and implement `Reduce` in terms of it.; - Add support for a more general leafname syntax that includes pathnames with multiple dots, such as ""myBranch.mySubBranch.myLeaf"". This is available both for jitted expressions and for lists of column names.; - The CSV data source (TCsvDS) can now be constructed with a chunk size parameter, and as a result the CSV file will be read progressively, in chunks of the specified size.

The `RooAbsBinning` interface for bin index lookups was changed to enable vectorized implementations.; Instead of having the override `RooAbsBinning::binNumber()`, the binning implementations now have to override the `RooAbsBinning::binNumbers()` function to evaluate the bin indices of multiple values in one function call. ### Disable relative and absolute epsilon in `RooAbsRealLValue::inRange()`.

Integrability,"`) is used to compile C family languages. The; command-line interface of the frontend is considered to be an implementation; detail, intentionally has no external documentation, and is subject to change; without notice. Language frontends for other languages; --------------------------------------. Clang can be provided with inputs written in non-C-family languages. In such; cases, an external tool will be used to compile the input. The; currently-supported languages are:. * Ada (``-x ada``, ``.ad[bs]``); * Fortran (``-x f95``, ``.f``, ``.f9[05]``, ``.for``, ``.fpp``, case-insensitive); * Java (``-x java``). In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags. The set of implicitly-linked libraries depend on the language mode. As a; consequence, you should use ``clang++`` when linking C++ programs in order; to ensure the C++ runtimes are provided. .. no",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst:4244,integrat,integrated-as,4244,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrated-as']

I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time. We have seen too many cases where the header location was mis-stated, and as a consequence,; CMake did not generate the proper dependencies. If the header should not be taken into account for dependencies and / or if; the header will not be found (e.g. the standard library's `vector`) please pass the header through the `NODEPHEADERS` option; to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` or `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

Formatting strings (the ``formatv`` function); ---------------------------------------------; While LLVM doesn't necessarily do a lot of string manipulation and parsing, it; does do a lot of string formatting. From diagnostic messages, to llvm tool; outputs such as ``llvm-readobj`` to printing verbose disassembly listings and; LLDB runtime logging, the need for string formatting is pervasive. The ``formatv`` is similar in spirit to ``printf``, but uses a different syntax; which borrows heavily from Python and C#. Unlike ``printf`` it deduces the type; to be formatted at compile time, so it does not need a format specifier such as; ``%d``. This reduces the mental overhead of trying to construct portable format; strings, especially for platform-specific types like ``size_t`` or pointer types.; Unlike both ``printf`` and Python, it additionally fails to compile if LLVM does; not know how to format the type. These two properties ensure that the function; is both safer and simpler to use than traditional formatting methods such as; the ``printf`` family of functions. Simple formatting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

For instance:. ``` {.cpp}; obj->Dump(); // lists all data members and their current values; obj->Inspect(); // opens a window to browse data members; obj->DrawClass(); // Draws the class inheritance tree; ```. For an example of `obj->Inspect()`, see ""Inspecting Objects"". ### Collections. To store an object in a ROOT collection, it must be a descendent of; **`TObject`**. This is convenient if you want to store objects of; different classes in the same collection and execute the method of the; same name on all members of the collection. For example, the list of; graphics primitives are in a ROOT collection called **`TList`**. When; the canvas is drawn, the `Paint` method is executed on the entire; collection. Each member may be a different class, and if the `Paint`; method is not implemented, **`TObject::Paint`** will be executed. ### Input/Output. The `TObject::Write` method is the interface to the ROOT I/O system. It; streams the object into a buffer using the `Streamer` method. It; supports cycle numbers and automatic schema evolution. See; ""Input/Output"". ### Paint/Draw. These graphics methods are defaults; their implementation in; **`TObject`** does not use the graphics subsystem. The `TObject::Draw`; method is simply a call to `AppendPad`. The `Paint` method is empty. The; default is provided so that one can call `Paint` in a collection. The; method `GetDrawOption` returns the draw option that was used when the; object was drawn on the canvas. This is especially relevant with; histograms and graphs. ### Clone/DrawClone. Two useful methods are `Clone` and `DrawClone`. The `Clone` method takes; a snapshot of the object with the `Streamer` and creates a new object.; The `DrawClone` method does the same thing and in addition draws the; clone. ### Browse. This method is called if the object is browse-able and is to be; displayed in the object browser.

Integrability,"`,; ``Clang module map modules`` or ``Clang c++ modules``. Module and module unit; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A module consists of one or more module units. A module unit is a special; translation unit. Every module unit must have a module declaration. The syntax; of the module declaration is:. .. code-block:: c++. [export] module module_name[:partition_name];. Terms enclosed in ``[]`` are optional. The syntax of ``module_name`` and ``partition_name``; in regex form corresponds to ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9\.]*``. In particular, a literal dot ``.``; in the name has no semantic meaning (e.g. implying a hierarchy). In this document, module units are classified into:. * Primary module interface unit. * Module implementation unit. * Module interface partition unit. * Internal module partition unit. A primary module interface unit is a module unit whose module declaration is; ``export module module_name;``. The ``module_name`` here denotes the name of the; module. A module should have one and only one primary module interface unit. A module implementation unit is a module unit whose module declaration is; ``module module_name;``.

If there are comments containing the different `INSTRUMENT_TYPE`,; then both data sets remain available. In contrast with an AnalysisRegion,; an InstrumentRegion does not need a comment to end the region. Comments that are prefixed with `LLVM-MCA-` but do not correspond to; a valid `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` for the target cause an error, except for; `BEGIN` and `END`, since those correspond to AnalysisRegions. Comments; that do not start with `LLVM-MCA-` are ignored by :program `llvm-mca`. An instruction (a MCInst) is added to an InstrumentRegion R only; if its location is in range [R.RangeStart, R.RangeEnd].

Integrability,"`ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process. For instance,; if we used the regular ``DeclContext::lookup()`` to find the existing; declarations in the ""to"" context then the ``lookup()`` call itself would; initiate a new import while we are in the middle of importing a declaration!; (By the time we initiate the lookup we haven't registered yet that we already; started to import the node of the ""from"" context.) This is why we use; ``DeclContext::noload_lookup()`` instead.

When Clang; grew C++ support, the parser stopped supporting general ``Action`` clients --; it now always talks to the :ref:`Sema library <Sema>`. However, the Parser; still accesses AST objects only through opaque types like ``ExprResult`` and; ``StmtResult``. Only :ref:`Sema <Sema>` looks at the AST node contents of these; wrappers. .. _AST:. The AST Library; ===============. .. _ASTPhilosophy:. Design philosophy; -----------------. Immutability; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are; generally designed to be immutable once created. This provides a number of key; benefits:. * Canonicalization of the ""meaning"" of nodes is possible as soon as the nodes; are created, and is not invalidated by later addition of more information.; For example, we :ref:`canonicalize types <CanonicalType>`, and use a; canonicalized representation of expressions when determining whether two; function template declarations involving dependent expressions declare the; same entity.; * AST nodes can be reused when they have the same meaning. For example, we; reuse ``Type`` nodes when representing the same type (but maintain separate; ``TypeLoc``\s for each instance where a type is written), and we reuse; non-dependent ``Stmt`` and ``Expr`` nodes across instantiations of a; template.; * Serialization and deserialization of the AST to/from AST files is simpler:; we do not need to track modifications made to AST nodes imported from AST; files and serialize separate ""update records"". There are unfortunately exceptions to this general approach, such as:. * The first declaration of a redeclarable entity maintains a pointer to the; most recent declaration of that entity, which naturally needs to change as; more declarations are parsed.; * Name lookup tables in declaration contexts change after the namespace; declaration is formed.; * We attempt to maintai",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:58088,depend,dependent,58088,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"`__typeof`` and C++ template argument substitution. .. admonition:: Rationale. Any compiler operation which incidentally strips type ""sugar"" from a type; will yield a type without the attribute, which may result in unexpected; behavior. .. _arc.objects.retains:. Retain count semantics; ----------------------. A retainable object pointer is either a :arc-term:`null pointer` or a pointer; to a valid object. Furthermore, if it has block pointer type and is not; ``null`` then it must actually be a pointer to a block object, and if it has; ``Class`` type (possibly protocol-qualified) then it must actually be a pointer; to a class object. Otherwise ARC does not enforce the Objective-C type system; as long as the implementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document.

Integrability,"`` also records an extra; ``Stmt*`` that represents the *terminator* of the block. A terminator is; simply the statement that caused the control-flow, and is used to identify the; nature of the conditional control-flow between blocks. For example, in the; case of an if-statement, the terminator refers to the ``IfStmt`` object in the; AST that represented the given branch. To illustrate, consider the following code example:. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int x) {; x = x + 1;; if (x > 2); x++;; else {; x += 2;; x *= 2;; }. return x;; }. After invoking the parser+semantic analyzer on this code fragment, the AST of; the body of ``foo`` is referenced by a single ``Stmt*``. We can then construct; an instance of ``CFG`` representing the control-flow graph of this function; body by single call to a static class method:. .. code-block:: c++. Stmt *FooBody = ...; std::unique_ptr<CFG> FooCFG = CFG::buildCFG(FooBody);. Along with providing an interface to iterate over its ``CFGBlocks``, the; ``CFG`` class also provides methods that are useful for debugging and; visualizing CFGs. For example, the method ``CFG::dump()`` dumps a; pretty-printed version of the CFG to standard error. This is especially useful; when one is using a debugger such as gdb. For example, here is the output of; ``FooCFG->dump()``:. .. code-block:: text. [ B5 (ENTRY) ]; Predecessors (0):; Successors (1): B4.

Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file; (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object; file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object; formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. .

Custom lowering of intrinsics; ------------------------------. For GCs which use barriers or unusual treatment of stack roots, the; implementor is responsibly for providing a custom pass to lower the; intrinsics with the desired semantics. If you have opted in to custom; lowering of a particular intrinsic your pass **must** eliminate all; instances of the corresponding intrinsic in functions which opt in to; your GC. The best example of such a pass is the ShadowStackGC and it's; ShadowStackGCLowering pass.

LLVM provides support for associating stackmaps with the return address of; a call.

Using gcroot, all call instructions are inferred to be possible; safepoints and will thus have an associated stackmap. .. _assembly:.

Possible solutions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Let's briefly consider possible options about how and what we have to implement; in order to create full-featured functions merging, and also what it would; mean for us. Equal function detection obviously supposes that a ""detector"" method to be; implemented and latter should answer the question ""whether functions are equal"".; This ""detector"" method consists of tiny ""sub-detectors"", which each answers; exactly the same question, but for function parts. As the second step, we should merge equal functions. So it should be a ""merger""; method. ""Merger"" accepts two functions *F1* and *F2*, and produces *F1F2*; function, the result of merging. Having such routines in our hands, we can process a whole module, and merge all; equal functions. In this case, we have to compare every function with every another function. As; the reader may notice, this way seems to be quite expensive. Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level? Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account.

In fact, the division operation has the same effect as positioning; volumes in a given order inside the divided container - the advantage; being that the navigation in such a structure is much faster. When a; volume is divided, a volume family corresponding to the slices is; created. In case all slices can be represented by a single shape, only; one volume is added to the family and positioned N times inside the; divided volume, otherwise, each slice will be represented by a distinct; volume in the family. Divisions can be also performed in a given range of one axis. For that,; one has to specify also the starting coordinate value and the step:. ~~~{.cpp}; TGeoVolume *slicex = box->Divide(""SLICEX"",1,N,start,step);; ~~~.

The value of the $\mbox{FCN}$ function will in general; depend on one or more variable parameters whose meaning is defined by; the user (or by the intermediate program), but whose trial values are; determined by M . To take a simple example, suppose the problem is to fit a polynomial; through a set of data points.

To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved.

Integrability,"a class that is; defined in a library. #### Linktime Library Dependencies. When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and; fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call; to fit the histogram, the ""fitter"" will dynamically load libMinuit if; it is not yet loaded. #### Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking. plugin manager The Plugin Manager *",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:18045,depend,depends,18045,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"a single JITDylib. However, clients who want to JIT code; for languages/projects that traditionally rely on ahead-of-time linking (e.g.; C++) will find that this feature makes life much easier. Symbol lookup in ORC serves two other important functions, beyond providing; addresses for symbols: (1) It triggers compilation of the symbol(s) searched for; (if they have not been compiled already), and (2) it provides the; synchronization mechanism for concurrent compilation. The pseudo-code for the; lookup process is:. .. code-block:: none. construct a query object from a query set and query handler; lock the session; lodge query against requested symbols, collect required materializers (if any); unlock the session; dispatch materializers (if any). In this context a materializer is something that provides a working definition; of a symbol upon request. Usually materializers are just wrappers for compilers,; but they may also wrap a jit-linker directly (if the program representation; backing the definitions is an object file), or may even be a class that writes; bits directly into memory (for example, if the definitions are; stubs). Materialization is the blanket term for any actions (compiling, linking,; splatting bits, registering with runtimes, etc.) that are required to generate a; symbol definition that is safe to call or access. As each materializer completes its work it notifies the JITDylib, which in turn; notifies any query objects that are waiting on the newly materialized; definitions. Each query object maintains a count of the number of symbols that; it is still waiting on, and once this count reaches zero the query object calls; the query handler with a *SymbolMap* (a map of symbol names to addresses); describing the result. If any symbol fails to materialize the query immediately; calls the query handler with an error. The collected materialization units are sent to the ExecutionSession to be; dispatched, and the dispatch behavior can be set by the client.

Integrability,"a; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:7954,interface,interface,7954,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"a``; or ``afree`` to make it clear that this stack adjusting cleanup is less; powerful than a full stack save and restore. Nested Calls and Copy Elision; -----------------------------. We also want to be able to support copy elision into these argument; slots. This means we have to support multiple live argument; allocations. Consider the evaluation of:. .. code-block:: c++. // Foo is non-trivial.; struct Foo { int a; Foo(); Foo(const &Foo); ~Foo(); };; Foo bar(Foo b);; int main() {; bar(bar(Foo()));; }. In this case, we want to be able to elide copies into ``bar``'s argument; slots. That means we need to have more than one set of argument frames; active at the same time. First, we need to allocate the frame for the; outer call so we can pass it in as the hidden struct return pointer to; the middle call. Then we do the same for the middle call, allocating a; frame and passing its address to ``Foo``'s default constructor. By; wrapping the evaluation of the inner ``bar`` with stack save and; restore, we can have multiple overlapping active call frames. Callee-cleanup Calling Conventions; ----------------------------------. Another wrinkle is the existence of callee-cleanup conventions. On; Windows, all methods and many other functions adjust the stack to clear; the memory used to pass their arguments. In some sense, this means that; the allocas are automatically cleared by the call. However, LLVM; instead models this as a write of undef to all of the inalloca values; passed to the call instead of a stack adjustment. Frontends should; still restore the stack pointer to avoid a stack leak. Exceptions; ----------. There is also the possibility of an exception. If argument evaluation; or copy construction throws an exception, the landing pad must do; cleanup, which includes adjusting the stack pointer to avoid a stack; leak. This means the cleanup of the stack memory cannot be tied to the; call itself. There needs to be a separate IR-level instruction that can; perform in",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst:4725,wrap,wrapping,4725,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapping']

The ``__builtin_readcyclecounter()`` builtin returns the cycle counter value,; which may be either global or process/thread-specific depending on the target.; As the backing counters often overflow quickly (on the order of seconds) this; should only be used for timing small intervals. When not supported by the; target, the return value is always zero. This builtin takes no arguments and; produces an unsigned long long result.

Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed; by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to; invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches. Wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of loads and; sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load, atomic with; return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the completion of; store and atomic without return in order. See ``MEM_ORDERED`` field in; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx12-table`. Wavefronts can be executed in WGP or CU wavefront execution mode:. * In WGP wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed; on the SIMDs of both CUs of the WGP. Therefore, explicit management of the per; CU L0 caches is required for work-group synchronization. Also accesses to L1; at work-group scope need to be explicitly ordered as the accesses from; different CUs are not ordered.; * In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed on; the SIMDs of a single CU of the WGP. Therefore, all global memory access by; the work-group access the same L0 which in turn ensures L1 accesses are; ordered and so do not require explicit management of the caches for; work-group synchronization.

If the file is compressed,; the savings are minimal since most values are zero; however, it saves; some space when the file is not compressed. A call; to` IgnoreTObjectStreamer` also prevents the creation of two additional; branches when splitting the object. If left alone, two branches called; `fBits` and `fUniqueID` will appear. ## Motivation. If you want to integrate and use your classes with ROOT, to enjoy; features like, extensive RTTI (Run Time Type Information) and ROOT; object I/O and inspection, you have to add the following line to your; class header files:. ``` {.cpp}; ClassDef(ClassName,ClassVersionID); //The class title; ```. For example in `TLine.h` we have:. ``` {.cpp}; ClassDef(TLine,1); //A line segment; ```. The **`ClassVersionID`** is used by the ROOT I/O system. It is written; on the output stream and during reading you can check this version ID; and take appropriate action depending on the value of the ID. See; ""Streamers"". Every time you change the data members of a class, you; should increase its `ClassVersionID` by one. The `ClassVersionID` should; be `>=1`. Set `ClassVersionID=0` in case you don't need object I/O. To; be able to generate properly documentation for your classes using; **`THtml`** you must add the statement:. ``` {.cpp}; ClassImp(ClassName); ```. For example in `TLine.cxx`:. ``` {.cpp}; ClassImp(TLine); ```. Note that you should provide a default constructor for your classes,; i.e. a constructor with zero parameters or with one or more parameters; all with default values in case you want to use object I/O. If do not; provide such a default constructor, you MUST implement an I/O; constructor. If not you will get a compile time error. See the ""The; Default Constructor"" paragraph in this chapter.

The same functionality can be implemented by calling `RooAbsData::reduce` on the Markov Chain's `RooDataSet*` (obtained using `MarkovChain::GetAsConstDataSet`) and then obtaining its binned clone(for `RooDataHist`). An example in Python would be:. ```py; mcInt = mc.GetInterval() # Obtain the MCMCInterval from a configured MCMCCalculator; mkc = mcInt.GetChain() # Obtain the MarkovChain; mkcData = mkc.GetAsConstDataSet(); mcIntParams = mcInt.GetParameters(). chainDataset = mkcData.reduce(SelectVars=mcIntParams, EventRange=(mcInt.GetNumBurnInSteps(), mkc.Size())); chainDataHist = chainDataset.binnedClone(); ```. * The following methods related to the RooAbsArg interface are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.; They should be replaced with the suitable alternatives interfaces:. - `RooAbsArg::getDependents()`: use `getObservables()`; - `RooAbsArg::dependentOverlaps()`: use `observableOverlaps()`; - `RooAbsArg::checkDependents()`: use `checkObservables()`; - `RooAbsArg::recursiveCheckDependents()`: use `recursiveCheckObservables()`. ## Graphics Backends. ## 2D Graphics Libraries. ## 3D Graphics Libraries. ## Geometry Libraries. ## Database Libraries. ## Networking Libraries. ## GUI Libraries. ## Montecarlo Libraries. ## PROOF Libraries. ## PyROOT. ### Typesafe `TTree::SetBranchAddress()` for array inputs.

In particular this means that several I/O operations (including TDirectory::Write) are thread safe (as long as all the required TClass and TStreamerInfo has been previously setup).; Note: This model does not support sharing TFile amongst threads (i.e. a TFile must be accessed from exactly one thread). This means that whenever a TFile's control is passed from a thread to another, the code must explicitly reset gDirectory to another value or there is a risk for this gDirectory to point to a stale pointer if the other thread deletes the TFile object. A TFile deletion will only affect the value of the local gDirectory and gFile. TMemFile; Introduce TMemFile and update TFileMerger to support incremental merges. Add new tutorials (net/treeClient.C + net/fastMergeServer.C); demonstrating how a TMemFile can be used to do parallel merge; from many clients. (TMemFile still needs to be better integrated; with TMessage and TSocket). The new TMemFile class support the TFile interface but only store; the information in memory.

Integrability,"ad their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`. A change in the argument handling of `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` might need your attention:; these macros now respect whether a header file was passed with its full relative path (the common case), or with a full path.; The latter allows to find headers at runtime - at the cost of a loss of relocatability: you cannot move the library containing; that dictionary to a different directory, because the header location is stored in the dictionary. This case is used by roottest; but should likely not be used by anything but test suites. Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time.

Integrability,"ad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT agains",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:18272,depend,depends,18272,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"ad.info``; metadata node to pass this information device compilation stage. Accessing Entries on the Device; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Accessing the entries in the device is done using the address field in the; :ref:`offload entry<table-tgt_offload_entry_structure>`. The runtime will set; the address to the pointer associated with the device image during runtime; initialization. This is used to call the corresponding kernel function when; entering a ``#pragma omp target`` region. For variables, the runtime maintains a; table mapping host pointers to device pointers. Global variables inside a; ``#pragma omp target declare`` directive are first initialized to the host's; address. Once the device address is initialized we insert it into the table to; map the host address to the device address. Debugging Information; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. We generate structures to hold debugging information that is passed to; ``libomptarget``. This allows the front-end to generate information the runtime; library uses for more informative error messages. This is done using the; standard :ref:`identifier structure <table-ident_t_structure>` used in; ``libomp`` and ``libomptarget``.

RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ;. A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro rf111_derivatives.C. Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface. Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X. These 'X-Y' chi-squared fits are interfaced through newly added method; RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataSet&,...). By default the event weight is; interpreted as the 'Y' value, but an YVar() argument can designate any other; dataset column as Y value. If X errors are defined, one can choose to integrate the fitted; function over the range of the X errors, rather than taking the central value by adding; an Integrate(true) argument to chi2FitTo(); Two new arguments, StoreError(const RooArgSet&) and StoreAsymError(const RooArgSet&); have been added to the RooDataSet constructor to simplify the process of storing the errors; of X and Y variables along with their values in a dataset.

When you have installed via a package manager (modern Linux; distributions have cross-compiler packages available), make; sure the target triple you set is *also* the prefix of your; cross-compiler toolchain. In this case, Clang will find the other binaries (assembler,; linker), but not always where the target headers and libraries; are. People add system-specific clues to Clang often, but as; things change, it's more likely that it won't find than the; other way around. So, here, you'll be a lot safer if you specify the include/library; directories manually (via ``-I`` and ``-L``). Target-Specific Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time. Also, finding the libraries for your target are not as easy; as for your host machine. There aren't many cross-libraries available; as packages to most OS's, so you'll have to either cross-compile them; from source, or download the package for your target platform,; extract the libraries and headers, put them in specific directories; and add ``-I`` and ``-L`` pointing to them. Also, some libraries have different dependencies on different targets,; so configuration tools to find dependencies in the host can get the; list wrong for the target platform. This means that the configuration; of your build can get things wrong when setting their own library; paths, and you'll have to augment it via additional flags (configure,; Make, CMak",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst:7758,depend,dependencies,7758,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective. Don't Include System Headers; ----------------------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header. Care has been taken to remove all such ``#includes`` from LLVM; while ``lib/Support`` was being developed. Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------. The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Support`` interfaces. Use Standard C++ Headers; ------------------------.

By default, `RooFit::MultiProcess` spins up as many workers as there are cores in the system (as detected by `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`).; To change the number of workers, call `RooFit::MultiProcess::Config::setDefaultNWorkers(desired_N_workers)` **before** creating the `RooMinimizer`. As noted above, offsetting is purely a function of the `RooMinimizer` when using `TestStatistics` classes.; Whereas with `fitTo` we can pass in a `RooFit::Offset(true)` optional `RooCmdArg` argument to activate offsetting, here we must do it on the minimizer as follows:; ``` {.cpp}; m.setOffsetting(true);; ```. All existing functionality of the `RooMinimizer` can be used on `TestStatistics` likelihoods as well.; For instance, running a `migrad` fit:; ``` {.cpp}; m.migrad(); ```. ## Constant term optimization; The `RooAbsTestStatistic` based classes not only combine statistics and calculation, but also constant term optimization routines.; These can be run on PDFs and datasets before starting a fit.; They search the calculation graph for parts that are independent of the fit parameters, precalculates them, and adds them to (a clone of) the dataset so that these values can be used during calculation. In `RooFit::TestStatistics`, we separated this functionality out into the `ConstantTermsOptimizer` class.; In fact, it is not so much a class, as it is a collection of static functions that can be applied to any combination of pdf and dataset.; This class does essentially the same as `constOptimizeTestStatistic` did on a `RooNLLVar`, except that it has been factored out into a separate class. ### Usage example: apply constant term optimization on pdf and dataset inside a likelihood; Applying the default `ConstantTermsOptimizer` optimization routines on the pdf and dataset inside a `RooAbsL` likelihood is as simple as:. ``` {.cpp}; likelihood.co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:9609,rout,routines,9609,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,1,['rout'],['routines']

Integrability,"after the node is created. For example, in case of a; ``FunctionDecl`` we first import the declaration context in which the function; is declared, then we create the ``FunctionDecl`` and only then we import the; body of the function. This means there are implicit dependencies between AST; nodes. These dependencies determine the order in which we visit nodes in the; ""from"" context. As with the regular graph traversal algorithms like DFS, we; keep track which nodes we have already visited in; ``ASTImporter::ImportedDecls``. Whenever we create a node then we immediately; add that to the ``ImportedDecls``. We must not start the import of any other; declarations before we keep track of the newly created one. This is essential,; otherwise, we would not be able to handle circular dependencies. To enforce; this, we wrap all constructor calls of all AST nodes in; ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()``. This wrapper ensures that all newly created; declarations are immediately marked as imported; also, if a declaration is; already marked as imported then we just return its counterpart in the ""to""; context. Consequently, calling a declaration's ``::Create()`` function directly; would lead to errors, please don't do that!. Even with the use of ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()`` there is still a; probability of having an infinite import recursion if things are imported from; each other in wrong way. Imagine that during the import of ``A``, the import of; ``B`` is requested before we could create the node for ``A`` (the constructor; needs a reference to ``B``). And the same could be true for the import of ``B``; (``A`` is requested to be imported before we could create the node for ``B``).; In case of the :ref:`templated-described swing <templated>` we take; extra attention to break the cyclical dependency: we import and set the; described template only after the ``CXXRecordDecl`` is created.

In some use cases, like in track reconstruction, it is needed to use the; content of the vector and rotation classes in conjunction with linear; algebra operations. We prefer to avoid any direct dependency to any; linear algebra package. However, we provide some hooks to convert to and; from linear algebra classes. The vector and the transformation classes; have methods which allow to get and set their data members (like; `SetCoordinates` and `GetCoordinates`) passing either a generic iterator; or a pointer to a contiguous set of data, like a C array. This allows an; easy connection with the linear algebra package, which in turn, allows; creation of matrices using C arrays (like the ROOT **`TMatrix`**; classes) or iterators (`SMatrix` classes). Multiplication between linear; algebra matrices and `GenVector` vectors is possible by using the; template free functions `ROOT::Math::VectorUtil::Mult`. This function; works for any linear algebra matrix, which implements the operator; (`i,j`) and with first matrix element at `i=j=0`. ### Example: 3D Vector Classes.

By now, these mechanisms are well proven with commercial java; implementation with a fully relocating collector having shipped using them.; There are a couple places where bugs might still linger; these are called out; below. They are still listed as ""experimental"" to indicate that no forward or backward; compatibility guarantees are offered across versions. If your use case is such; that you need some form of forward compatibility guarantee, please raise the; issue on the llvm-dev mailing list. LLVM still supports an alternate mechanism for conservative garbage collection; support using the ``gcroot`` intrinsic. The ``gcroot`` mechanism is mostly of; historical interest at this point with one exception - its implementation of; shadow stacks has been used successfully by a number of language frontends and; is still supported. Overview & Core Concepts; ========================. To collect dead objects, garbage collectors must be able to identify; any references to objects contained within executing code, and,; depending on the collector, potentially update them. The collector; does not need this information at all points in code - that would make; the problem much harder - but only at well-defined points in the; execution known as 'safepoints' For most collectors, it is sufficient; to track at least one copy of each unique pointer value. However, for; a collector which wishes to relocate objects directly reachable from; running code, a higher standard is required. One additional challenge is that the compiler may compute intermediate; results (""derived pointers"") which point outside of the allocation or; even into the middle of another allocation. The eventual use of this; intermediate value must yield an address within the bounds of the; allocation, but such ""exterior derived pointers"" may be visible to the; collector. Given this, a garbage collector can not safely rely on the; runtime value of an address to indicate the object it is associated; wit",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst:1278,depend,depending,1278,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Statepoints.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']

On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer name is formed by; combining ``__imp_`` and the function or variable name.; ``dllexport``; On Microsoft Windows targets, ""``dllexport``"" causes the compiler to provide; a global pointer to a pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the; ``dllimport`` attribute. the pointer name is formed by combining ``__imp_``; and the function or variable name. On XCOFF targets, ``dllexport`` indicates; that the symbol will be made visible to other modules using ""exported""; visibility and thus placed by the linker in the loader section symbol table.; Since this storage class exists for defining a dll interface, the compiler,; assembler and linker know it is externally referenced and must refrain from; deleting the symbol. A symbol with ``internal`` or ``private`` linkage cannot have a DLL storage; class. .. _tls_model:. Thread Local Storage Models; ---------------------------.

People add system-specific clues to Clang often, but as; things change, it's more likely that it won't find than the; other way around. So, here, you'll be a lot safer if you specify the include/library; directories manually (via ``-I`` and ``-L``). Target-Specific Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time.

Integrability,"airly simple and there is little code reuse opportunity anyway. .. _implementation-details:. Implementation Details; ======================. The current implementation of DDG differs slightly from the dependence; graph described in [1]_ in the following ways:. 1. The graph nodes in the paper represent three main program components, namely *assignment statements*, *for loop headers* and *while loop headers*. In this implementation, DDG nodes naturally represent LLVM IR instructions. An assignment statement in this implementation typically involves a node representing the ``store`` instruction along with a number of individual nodes computing the right-hand-side of the assignment that connect to the ``store`` node via a def-use edge. The loop header instructions are not represented as special nodes in this implementation because they have limited uses and can be easily identified, for example, through ``LoopAnalysis``.; 2. The paper describes five types of dependency edges between nodes namely *loop dependency*, *flow-*, *anti-*, *output-*, and *input-* dependencies. In this implementation *memory* edges represent the *flow-*, *anti-*, *output-*, and *input-* dependencies. However, *loop dependencies* are not made explicit, because they mainly represent association between a loop structure and the program elements inside the loop and this association is fairly obvious in LLVM IR itself.; 3. The paper describes two types of pi-blocks; *recurrences* whose bodies are SCCs and *IN* nodes whose bodies are not part of any SCC. In this implementation, pi-blocks are only created for *recurrences*. *IN* nodes remain as simple DDG nodes in the graph. References; ----------; .. [1] ""D. J. Kuck, R. H. Kuhn, D. A. Padua, B.

Commun.; ACM 5, 8 (1962). The default is ``-fno-cx-fortran-rules``. .. _floating-point-environment:. Accessing the floating point environment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Many targets allow floating point operations to be configured to control things; such as how inexact results should be rounded and how exceptional conditions; should be handled. This configuration is called the floating point environment.; C and C++ restrict access to the floating point environment by default, and the; compiler is allowed to assume that all operations are performed in the default; environment. When code is compiled in this default mode, operations that depend; on the environment (such as floating-point arithmetic and `FLT_ROUNDS`) may have; undefined behavior if the dynamic environment is not the default environment; for; example, `FLT_ROUNDS` may or may not simply return its default value for the target; instead of reading the dynamic environment, and floating-point operations may be; optimized as if the dynamic environment were the default. Similarly, it is undefined; behavior to change the floating point environment in this default mode, for example; by calling the `fesetround` function.; C provides two pragmas to allow code to dynamically modify the floating point environment:. - ``#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON`` allows dynamic changes to the entire floating; point environment. - ``#pragma STDC FENV_ROUND FE_DYNAMIC`` allows dynamic changes to just the floating; point rounding mode. This may be more optimizable than ``FENV_ACCESS ON`` because; the compiler can still ignore the possibility of floating-point exceptions by default. Both of these can be used either at the start of a block scope, in which case; they cover all code in that scope (unless they're turned off in a child scope),; or at the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:69517,depend,depend,69517,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

Our new class inherits from the ``cl::parser`` template class to fill in; the default, boiler plate code for us. We give it the data type that we parse; into, the last argument to the ``parse`` method, so that clients of our custom; parser know what object type to pass in to the parse method. (Here we declare; that we parse into '``unsigned``' variables.). For most purposes, the only method that must be implemented in a custom parser; is the ``parse`` method. The ``parse`` method is called whenever the option is; invoked, passing in the option itself, the option name, the string to parse, and; a reference to a return value. If the string to parse is not well-formed, the; parser should output an error message and return true. Otherwise it should; return false and set '``Val``' to the parsed value.

Code reviewers are encouraged to request a release note if they think one is; warranted when performing a code review. Quality; -------. The minimum quality standards that any change must satisfy before being; committed to the main development branch are:. #. Code must adhere to the `LLVM Coding Standards <CodingStandards.html>`_. #. Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one platform. #. Bug fixes and new features should `include a testcase`_ so we know if the; fix/feature ever regresses in the future. #. Code must pass the ``llvm/test`` test suite. #. The code must not cause regressions on a reasonable subset of llvm-test,; where ""reasonable"" depends on the contributor's judgement and the scope of; the change (more invasive changes require more testing). A reasonable subset; might be something like ""``llvm-test/MultiSource/Benchmarks``"". #.

The surrounding comments should be sufficient; to provide the context behind such links. Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing any problems found in; the future that the change is responsible for. For example:. * The code should compile cleanly on all supported platforms. * The changes should not cause any correctness regressions in the ``llvm-test``; suite and must not cause any major performance regressions. * The change set should not cause performance or correctness regressions for the; LLVM tools. * The changes should not cause performance or correctness regressions in code; compiled by LLVM on ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:12855,depend,depends,12855,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`. To do the same from `TTree::CopyEntries` add to the option string ""cachesize=SIZE"". To update the size of the cache or disable it from `hadd`, use the command line option `-cachesize SIZE`. `SIZE` shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in 'human readable form' (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. ### Other Changes. * Update `TChain::LoadTree` so that the user call back routine is actually called for each input file even those containing `TTree` objects with no entries.; * Repair setting the branch address of a leaflist style branch taking directly the address of the struct. (Note that leaflist is nonetheless still deprecated and declaring the struct to the interpreter and passing the object directly to create the branch is much better).; * Provide an implicitly parallel implementation of `TTree::GetEntry`. The approach is based on creating a task per top-level branch in order to do the reading, unzipping and deserialisation in parallel. In addition, a getter and a setter methods are provided to check the status and enable/disable implicit multi-threading for that tree (see Parallelisation section for more information about implicit multi-threading).; * Properly support `std::cin` (and other stream that can not be rewound) in `TTree::ReadStream`.

Integrability,"al calculation of the alias analysis results (the ""run""; method) is only performed once, but many (perhaps duplicate) queries may be; performed. Because of this, try to move as much computation to the run method; as possible (within reason). Limitations; -----------. The AliasAnalysis infrastructure has several limitations which make writing a; new ``AliasAnalysis`` implementation difficult. There is no way to override the default alias analysis. It would be very useful; to be able to do something like ""``opt -my-aa -O2``"" and have it use ``-my-aa``; for all passes which need AliasAnalysis, but there is currently no support for; that, short of changing the source code and recompiling. Similarly, there is; also no way of setting a chain of analyses as the default. There is no way for transform passes to declare that they preserve; ``AliasAnalysis`` implementations. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface includes; ``deleteValue`` and ``copyValue`` methods which are intended to allow a pass to; keep an AliasAnalysis consistent, however there's no way for a pass to declare; in its ``getAnalysisUsage`` that it does so. Some passes attempt to use; ``AU.addPreserved<AliasAnalysis>``, however this doesn't actually have any; effect. Similarly, the ``opt -p`` option introduces ``ModulePass`` passes between each; pass, which prevents the use of ``FunctionPass`` alias analysis passes. The ``AliasAnalysis`` API does have functions for notifying implementations when; values are deleted or copied, however these aren't sufficient. There are many; other ways that LLVM IR can be modified which could be relevant to; ``AliasAnalysis`` implementations which can not be expressed. The ``AliasAnalysisDebugger`` utility seems to suggest that ``AliasAnalysis``; implementations can expect that they will be informed of any relevant ``Value``; before it appears in an alias query. However, popular clients such as ``GVN``; don't support this, and are known to trigger errors when run with the; ``AliasAna",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst:17549,interface,interface,17549,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AliasAnalysis.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters.

The original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` produced models that consisted of a; Poisson term for each bin. In this ""number counting form"" the dataset has one; row and the collumns corresponded to the number of events for each bin. This; led to severe performance problems in statistical tools that generated; pseudo-experiments and evaluated likelihood ratio test statistics. Nowadays, everyone uses the faster `HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast` implementation that; produces a model in the ""standard form"" where the dataset has one row for each; event, and the column corresponds to the value of the observable in the; histogram. Therefore, the original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` is now removed to avoid; confusion and maintainance burden. #### Removing constant parameter flag from RooStats:HistFactory::NormFactor. As printed out by the HistFactory in a warning message for a long time already,; setting the `Const` attribute to the `<NormFactor>` tag is deprecated and it; will be ignored. Instead, add `<ParamSetting Const=""True""> myparam </ParamSetting>` to your top-level XML's `<Measurement>` entry.

IR producers (front-ends) must follow this rule, and consumers; (optimizers, specifically alias analysis) benefit from being able to rely on; it. See the `Rules`_ section for more information. And, GEP is more concise in common cases. However, for the underlying integer computation implied, there is no; difference. I'm writing a backend for a target which needs custom lowering for GEP. How do I do this?; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. You don't. The integer computation implied by a GEP is target-independent.; Typically what you'll need to do is make your backend pattern-match expressions; trees involving ADD, MUL, etc., which are what GEP is lowered into. This has the; advantage of letting your code work correctly in more cases. GEP does use target-dependent parameters for the size and layout of data types,; which targets can customize. If you require support for addressing units which are not 8 bits, you'll need to; fix a lot of code in the backend, with GEP lowering being only a small piece of; the overall picture. How does VLA addressing work with GEPs?; ---------------------------------------. GEPs don't natively support VLAs. LLVM's type system is entirely static, and GEP; address computations are guided by an LLVM type. VLA indices can be implemented as linearized indices. For example, an expression; like ``X[a][b][c]``, must be effectively lowered into a form like; ``X[a*m+b*n+c]``, so that it appears to the GEP as a single-dimensional array; reference. This means if you want to write an analysis which understands array indices and; you want to support VLAs, your code will have to be prepared to reverse-engineer; the linearization.

It uses Clang as a library to compile the; high level programming language into LLVM IR. Then the LLVM IR is executed by; the LLVM just-in-time (JIT) infrastructure. Clang-Repl is suitable for exploratory programming and in places where time; to insight is important. Clang-Repl is a project inspired by the work in; `Cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`_, a LLVM-based C/C++ interpreter; developed by the field of high energy physics and used by the scientific data; analysis framework `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_. Clang-Repl allows to move parts; of Cling upstream, making them useful and available to a broader audience. Clang-Repl Basic Data Flow; ==========================. .. image:: ClangRepl_design.png; :align: center; :alt: ClangRepl design. Clang-Repl data flow can be divided into roughly 8 phases:. 1. Clang-Repl controls the input infrastructure by an interactive prompt or by; an interface allowing the incremental processing of input. 2. Then it sends the input to the underlying incremental facilities in Clang; infrastructure. 3. Clang compiles the input into an AST representation. 4. When required the AST can be further transformed in order to attach specific; behavior. 5. The AST representation is then lowered to LLVM IR. 6. The LLVM IR is the input format for LLVM’s JIT compilation infrastructure.; The tool will instruct the JIT to run specified functions, translating them; into machine code targeting the underlying device architecture (eg. Intel; x86 or NVPTX). 7. The LLVM JIT lowers the LLVM IR to machine code. 8. The machine code is then executed.

Integrability,"al_locks`, below. .. _limitations:. Known Limitations; =================. Lexical scope; -------------. Thread safety attributes contain ordinary C++ expressions, and thus follow; ordinary C++ scoping rules. In particular, this means that mutexes and other; capabilities must be declared before they can be used in an attribute.; Use-before-declaration is okay within a single class, because attributes are; parsed at the same time as method bodies. (C++ delays parsing of method bodies; until the end of the class.) However, use-before-declaration is not allowed; between classes, as illustrated below. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo;. class Bar {; void bar(Foo* f) REQUIRES(f->mu); // Error: mu undeclared.; };. class Foo {; Mutex mu;; };. Private Mutexes; ---------------. Good software engineering practice dictates that mutexes should be private; members, because the locking mechanism used by a thread-safe class is part of; its internal implementation. However, private mutexes can sometimes leak into; the public interface of a class.; Thread safety attributes follow normal C++ access restrictions, so if ``mu``; is a private member of ``c``, then it is an error to write ``c.mu`` in an; attribute. One workaround is to (ab)use the ``RETURN_CAPABILITY`` attribute to provide a; public *name* for a private mutex, without actually exposing the underlying; mutex. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class MyClass {; private:; Mutex mu;. public:; // For thread safety analysis only. Does not need to be defined.; Mutex* getMu() RETURN_CAPABILITY(mu);. void doSomething() REQUIRES(mu);; };. void doSomethingTwice(MyClass& c) REQUIRES(c.getMu()) {; // The analysis thinks that c.getMu() == c.mu; c.doSomething();; c.doSomething();; }. In the above example, ``doSomethingTwice()`` is an external routine that; requires ``c.mu`` to be locked, which cannot be declared directly because ``mu``; is private. This pattern is discouraged because it; violates encapsulation, but it is sometimes necessary,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:20150,interface,interface,20150,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fldcww"", ""fldcw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fucompi"", ""fucomip"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""ud2a"", ""ud2"">;. ... and many others. With a MnemonicAlias definition, the mnemonic is remapped; simply and directly. Though MnemonicAlias's can't look at any aspect of the; instruction (such as the operands) they can depend on global modes (the same; ones supported by the matcher), through a Requires clause:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfq"">, Requires<[In64BitMode]>;; def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfl"">, Requires<[In32BitMode]>;. In this example, the mnemonic gets mapped into a different one depending on; the current instruction set. Instruction Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The most general phase of alias processing occurs while matching is happening:; it provides new forms for the matcher to match along with a specific instruction; to generate. An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate.

JITLink maps all relocatable object formats to a generic ``LinkGraph`` type; that is designed to make linking fast and easy (``LinkGraph`` instances can; also be created manually. See :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`). Relocatable object formats (e.g. COFF, ELF, MachO) differ in their details,; but share a common goal: to represent machine level code and data with; annotations that allow them to be relocated in a virtual address space. To; this end they usually contain names (symbols) for content defined inside the; file or externally, chunks of content that must be moved as a unit (sections; or subsections, depending on the format), and annotations describing how to; patch content based on the final address of some target symbol/section; (relocations). At a high level, the ``LinkGraph`` type represents these concepts as a decorated; graph. Nodes in the graph represent symbols and content, and edges represent; relocations. Each of the elements of the graph is listed here:. * ``Addressable`` -- A node in the link graph that can be assigned an address; in the executor process's virtual address space. Absolute and external symbols are represented using plain ``Addressable``; instances. Content defined inside the object file is represented using the; ``Block`` subclass. * ``Block`` -- An ``Addressable`` node that has ``Content`` (or is marked as; zero-filled), a parent ``Section``, a ``Size``, an ``Alignment`` (and an; ``AlignmentOffset``), and a list of ``Edge`` instances.

This; includes cases where your method is documented to return nil given certain; inputs.; You return nil based on some external condition (such as an out-of-memory; error), but the client can't do anything about it either.; You return nil only when the caller passes input documented to be invalid.; That means it's the client's fault.; You return nil in some totally undocumented case. In (1) you should annotate the method as returning a _Nonnull; object.; In (2) the method should be marked _Nullable.; In (3) you should probably annotate the method _Nonnull. Why?; Because no callers will actually check for nil, given that they can't do; anything about the situation and don't know what went wrong. At this point; things have gone so poorly that there's basically no way to recover.; The least happy case",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/faq.html:4818,Depend,Depending,4818,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/faq.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/faq.html,1,['Depend'],['Depending']
Integrability,"allows an intrinsic; function which accepts multiple arguments, but needs all of them to be; of the same type, to only be overloaded with respect to a single; argument or the result. Overloaded intrinsics will have the names of its overloaded argument; types encoded into its function name, each preceded by a period. Only; those types which are overloaded result in a name suffix. Arguments; whose type is matched against another type do not. For example, the; ``llvm.ctpop`` function can take an integer of any width and returns an; integer of exactly the same integer width. This leads to a family of; functions such as ``i8 @llvm.ctpop.i8(i8 %val)`` and; ``i29 @llvm.ctpop.i29(i29 %val)``. Only one type, the return type, is; overloaded, and only one type suffix is required. Because the argument's; type is matched against the return type, it does not require its own; name suffix. :ref:`Unnamed types <t_opaque>` are encoded as ``s_s``. Overloaded intrinsics; that depend on an unnamed type in one of its overloaded argument types get an; additional ``.<number>`` suffix. This allows differentiating intrinsics with; different unnamed types as arguments. (For example:; ``llvm.ssa.copy.p0s_s.2(%42*)``) The number is tracked in the LLVM module and; it ensures unique names in the module. While linking together two modules, it is; still possible to get a name clash. In that case one of the names will be; changed by getting a new number. For target developers who are defining intrinsics for back-end code; generation, any intrinsic overloads based solely the distinction between; integer or floating point types should not be relied upon for correct; code generation. In such cases, the recommended approach for target; maintainers when defining intrinsics is to create separate integer and; FP intrinsics rather than rely on overloading. For example, if different; codegen is required for ``llvm.target.foo(<4 x i32>)`` and; ``llvm.target.foo(<4 x float>)`` then these should be split into; d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:490387,depend,depend,490387,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application. Any error will halt the link process and notify the context of failure. In ORC,; reported failures are propagated to queries pending on definitions provided by; the failing link, and also through edges of the dependence graph to any queries; waiting on dependent symbols. .. _connection_to_orc_runtime:. Connection to the ORC Runtime; =============================. The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor). For example: Execution of MachO static; initializers in the ORC runtime is performed by the ``jit_dlopen`` function,; which calls back to the JIT process to ask for the list of address ranges of; ``__mod_init`` sections to walk.

During symbolic execution, SVal; objects are used to represent the semantic evaluation of expressions.; They can represent things like concrete; integers, symbolic values, or memory locations (which are memory regions).; They are a discriminated union of ""values"", symbolic and otherwise.; If a value isn't symbolic, usually that means there is no symbolic; information to track. For example, if the value was an integer, such as; 42, it would be a ConcreteInt,; and the checker doesn't usually need to track any state with the concrete; number. In some cases, SVal is not a symbol, but it really should be; a symbolic value. This happens when the analyzer cannot reason about something; (yet). An example is floating point numbers. In such cases, the; SVal will evaluate to UnknownVal.; This represents a case that is outside the realm of the analyzer's reasoning; capabilities.

We believe that Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) are a great way; to pull together various pieces of the development puzzle, and aim to make clang; work well in such an environment. The chief advantage of an IDE is that they; typically have visibility across your entire project and are long-lived; processes, whereas stand-alone compiler tools are typically invoked on each; individual file in the project, and thus have limited scope.; There are many implications of this difference, but a significant one has to; do with efficiency and caching: sharing an address space across different files; in a project, means that you can use intelligent caching and other techniques to; dramatically reduce analysis/compilation time.; A further difference between IDEs and batch compiler is that they often; impose very different requirements on the front-end: they depend on high; performance in order to provide a ""snappy"" experience, and thus really want; techniques like ""incremental compilation"", ""fuzzy parsing"", etc. Finally, IDEs; often have very different requirements than code generation, often requiring; information that a codegen-only frontend can throw away.

We actively intend for clang (and LLVM as a whole) to be used for; commercial projects, not only as a stand-alone compiler but also as a library; embedded inside a proprietary application.

We have seen up to 3x increase.; * On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves) 16+ Terabytes of; virtual address space.

Integrability,"ameters from the observed distribution of frequencies at which; certain values of the measurement are observed. Measurements of this; kind require means to generate and visualize frequency distributions,; so-called histograms, and stringent statistical treatment to extract the; model parameters from purely statistical distributions. Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data; analysis. By repeated generation of ""pseudo-data"", which are analysed in; the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can; be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the; measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the; possibility to test the effects of different assumptions. A powerful software framework addressing all of the above requirements; is ROOT, an open source project coordinated by the European Organisation for; Nuclear Research, CERN in Geneva. ROOT is very flexible and provides both a programming interface to use in own; applications and a graphical user interface for interactive data analysis. The; purpose of this document is to serve as a beginners guide and provides extendable; examples for your own use cases, based on typical problems addressed in; student labs. This guide will hopefully lay the ground for more complex; applications in your future scientific work building on a modern,; state-of the art tool for data analysis. This guide in form of a tutorial is intended to introduce you quickly to the; ROOT package. This goal will be accomplished using concrete examples, according; to the ""learning by doing"" principle. Also because of this reason, this guide; cannot cover all the complexity of the ROOT package. Nevertheless, once you feel; confident with the concepts presented in the following chapters, you will be; able to appreciate the ROOT Users Guide [@ROOT_Users_Guide] and navigate through; the Class Reference [@ROOT_Class_Reference] to find all the details you might be; interested in.

Integrability,"ameters:. Indirect parameters; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If a function or method parameter has type ``T*``, where ``T`` is an; ownership-unqualified retainable object pointer type, then:. * if ``T`` is ``const``-qualified or ``Class``, then it is implicitly; qualified with ``__unsafe_unretained``;; * otherwise, it is implicitly qualified with ``__autoreleasing``. .. admonition:: Rationale. ``__autoreleasing`` exists mostly for this case, the Cocoa convention for; out-parameters. Since a pointer to ``const`` is obviously not an; out-parameter, we instead use a type more useful for passing arrays. If the; user instead intends to pass in a *mutable* array, inferring; ``__autoreleasing`` is the wrong thing to do; this directs some of the; caution in the following rules about writeback. Such a type written anywhere else would be ill-formed by the general rule; requiring ownership qualifiers. This rule does not apply in Objective-C++ if a parameter's type is dependent in; a template pattern and is only *instantiated* to a type which would be a; pointer to an unqualified retainable object pointer type. Such code is still; ill-formed. .. admonition:: Rationale. The convention is very unlikely to be intentional in template code. .. _arc.ownership.inference.template.arguments:. Template arguments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If a template argument for a template type parameter is an retainable object; owner type that does not have an explicit ownership qualifier, it is adjusted; to have ``__strong`` qualification. This adjustment occurs regardless of; whether the template argument was deduced or explicitly specified. .. admonition:: Rationale. ``__strong`` is a useful default for containers (e.g., ``std::vector<id>``),; which would otherwise require explicit qualification. Moreover, unqualified; retainable object pointer types are unlikely to be useful within templates,; since they generally need to have a qualifier applied to the before being; used. .. _arc.method-families:.

Integrability,"aming)); -----------------------------------------------------. If a function is marked as ``arm_locally_streaming``, then the runtime SVE; vector length in the prologue/epilogue may be different from the vector length; in the function's body. This happens because we invoke smstart after setting up; the stack-frame and similarly invoke smstop before deallocating the stack-frame. To ensure we use the correct SVE vector length to allocate the locals with, we; can use the streaming vector-length to allocate the stack-slots through the; ``ADDSVL`` instruction, even when the CPU is not yet in streaming mode. This only works for locals and not callee-save slots, since LLVM doesn't support; mixing two different scalable vector lengths in one stack frame. That means that the; case where a function is marked ``arm_locally_streaming`` and needs to spill SVE; callee-saves in the prologue is currently unsupported. However, it is unlikely; for this to happen without user intervention, because ``arm_locally_streaming``; functions cannot take or return vector-length-dependent values. This would otherwise; require forcing both the SVE PCS using '``aarch64_sve_pcs``' combined with using; ``arm_locally_streaming`` in order to encounter this problem. This combination; can be prevented in Clang through emitting a diagnostic. An example of how the prologue/epilogue would look for a function that is; attributed with ``arm_locally_streaming``:. .. code-block:: c++. #define N 64. void __attribute__((arm_streaming_compatible)) some_use(svfloat32_t *);. // Use a float argument type, to check the value isn't clobbered by smstart.; // Use a float return type to check the value isn't clobbered by smstop.; float __attribute__((noinline, arm_locally_streaming)) foo(float arg) {; // Create local for SVE vector to check local is created with correct; // size when not yet in streaming mode (ADDSVL).; float array[N];; svfloat32_t vector;. some_use(&vector);; svst1_f32(svptrue_b32(), &array[0], vector",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AArch64SME.rst:12083,depend,dependent,12083,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AArch64SME.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AArch64SME.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

A section containing metadata on remark diagnostics will be emitted for the; following formats:. * ``yaml-strtab``; * ``bitstream``. This can be overridden by using the flag ``-remarks-section=<bool>``. The section is named:. * ``__LLVM,__remarks`` (MachO). C API; =====. LLVM provides a library that can be used to parse remarks through a shared; library named ``libRemarks``. The typical usage through the C API is like the following:. .. code-block:: c. LLVMRemarkParserRef Parser = LLVMRemarkParserCreateYAML(Buf, Size);; LLVMRemarkEntryRef Remark = NULL;; while ((Remark = LLVMRemarkParserGetNext(Parser))) {; // use Remark; LLVMRemarkEntryDispose(Remark); // Release memory.; }; bool HasError = LLVMRemarkParserHasError(Parser);; LLVMRemarkParserDispose(Parser);. Remark streamers; ================. The ``RemarkStreamer`` interface is used to unify the serialization; capabilities of remarks across all the components that can generate remarks. All remark serialization should go through the main remark streamer, the; ``llvm::remarks::RemarkStreamer`` set up in the ``LLVMContext``. The interface; takes remark objects converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark``, and takes care of; serializing it to the requested format, using the requested type of metadata,; etc. Typically, a specialized remark streamer will hold a reference to the one set; up in the ``LLVMContext``, and will operate on its own type of diagnostics. For example, LLVM IR passes will emit ``llvm::DiagnosticInfoOptimization*``; that get converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark`` objects. Then, clang could set; up its own specialized remark streamer that takes ``clang::Diagnostic``; objects. This can allow various components of the frontend to emit remarks; using the same techniques as the LLVM remarks.

That means in Python you don't have to use [RooWorkspace::var()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#acf5f9126ee264c234721a4ed1f9bf837) to access variables or [RooWorkspace::pdf()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#afa7384cece424a1a94a644bb05549eee) to access pdfs, but you can always get any object using square brackets. For example:; ```Python; # w is a RooWorkspace instance that contains the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` for which we want to generate toy data:; model.generate({w[""x""], w[""y""], w[""z""]}, 1000); ```. ### New PyROOT functions for interoperability with NumPy and Pandas.

Integrability,"and additional `primarily initial`; memory overheads at run-time.; Whether this is onerous depends strongly not only on the application, but; also on the rest of the software stack. The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; As a rule of thumb, if about 10% of classes are used, it takes several; hundreds of bound classes before the cppyy-approach is beneficial.; In High Energy Physics, from which it originated, cppyy is regularly used in; software stacks of many thousands of classes, where this advantage is very; important. `Distributing headers`; ----------------------. cppyy requires C/C++ headers to be available at run-time, which was never a; problem in the developer-centric world from which it originated: software; always had supported C++ APIs already, made available through header files,; and Python simply piggy-backed onto those.; JIT-ing code in those headers, which potentially picked up system headers; that were configured differently, was thus also never a problem.; Or rather, the same problem exists for C++, and configuration for C++ to; resolve potential issues translates t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:9134,depend,depending,9134,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++; compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is; very hard to do in a performance-portable way. In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization; paths, which drives its performance.; For example, basic inheritance sequentially lines up classes, whereas; multiple (virtual) inheritance usually requires thunks.; Thus, when calling base class methods on a derived instance, the latter; requires offset calculations that depend on that instance, whereas the former; has fixed offsets fully determined by the class definitions themselves.; By labeling classes appropriately, single inheritance classes (by far the; most common case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` iteration for both PyPy and; CPython, easily outperforming looping over an equivalent numpy array. In CPython, the performance of `non-overloaded` function calls depends; greatly on the Python interpreter's internal specializations; and Python3; has many specializations specific to basic extension modules (C function; pointer calls), gaining a performance boost of more than 30% over Python2.; Only since Python3.8 is there also better support for clo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:3024,depend,depend,3024,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

However, it is undefined behavior and the program is ill-formed, no; diagnostic required, if an ``init`` method attempts to use the previous value; of ``self`` after the completion of a delegate init call. It is conventional,; but not required, for an ``init`` method to return ``self``.

C.d.f and running integrals that are calculated from p.d.fs that have; support for analytical integration are constructed from an appropriately reconnected RooRealIntegral.; If numeric integration is required, the c.d.f or running integral is calculated by a dedicated class; RooRunningIntegral that precalculates results for all observable values, which is more efficient; in most use cases. Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently; that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound; and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably. Constraints management. New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.; The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions; and can thus be modeled by RooAbsPdf classes (e.g. a RooGaussian for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).; There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying; the constrain",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:6049,integrat,integration,6049,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Because default argument promotion only applies to the standard floating-point; types, ``_Float16`` values are not promoted to ``double`` when passed as variadic; or untyped arguments.

These are; converted to a canonical representation per hardware-specific protocol.; - Many normal decimal floating-point numbers have non-canonical alternative; encodings.; - Some machines, like GPUs or ARMv7 NEON, do not support subnormal values.; These are treated as non-canonical encodings of zero and will be flushed to; a zero of the same sign by this operation.

Integrability,"ar source file is being edited by the user. To minimize the amount; of reparsing required after a change to the file, a form of precompiled header; --- called a precompiled *preamble* --- is automatically generated by parsing; all of the headers in the source file, up to and including the last; ``#include``. When only the source file changes (and none of the headers it; depends on), reparsing of that source file can use the precompiled preamble and; start parsing after the ``#include``\ s, so parsing time is proportional to the; size of the source file (rather than all of its includes). However, the; compilation of that translation unit may already use a precompiled header: in; this case, Clang will create the precompiled preamble as a chained precompiled; header that refers to the original precompiled header. This drastically; reduces the time needed to serialize the precompiled preamble for use in; reparsing. Chained precompiled headers get their name because each precompiled header can; depend on one other precompiled header, forming a chain of dependencies. A; translation unit will then include the precompiled header that starts the chain; (i.e., nothing depends on it). This linearity of dependencies is important for; the semantic model of chained precompiled headers, because the most-recent; precompiled header can provide information that overrides the information; provided by the precompiled headers it depends on, just like a header file; ``B.h`` that includes another header ``A.h`` can modify the state produced by; parsing ``A.h``, e.g., by ``#undef``'ing a macro defined in ``A.h``.

Historically, it has been possible for a class to provide its own; reference-count implementation by overriding ``retain``, ``release``, etc.; However, weak references to an object require coordination with its class's; reference-count implementation because, among other things, weak loads and; stores must be atomic with respect to the final release.

A; retainable object pointer type is **weak-unavailable** if; is a pointer to an (optionally protocol-qualified) Objective-C class ``T`` where; ``T`` or one of its superclasses has the ``objc_arc_weak_reference_unavailable``; attribute.

The ``BasicBlock`` constructor is used to create new basic blocks for; insertion into a function. The constructor optionally takes a name for the; new block, and a :ref:`Function <c_Function>` to insert it into.

Note that any attributes for the function result (``nonnull``,; ``signext``) come before the result type. Currently, only the following parameter attributes are defined:. ``zeroext``; This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return; value should be zero-extended to the extent required by the target's; ABI by the caller (for a parameter) or the callee (for a return value).; ``signext``; This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return; value should be sign-extended to the extent required by the target's; ABI (which is usually 32-bits) by the caller (for a parameter) or; the callee (for a return value).; ``inreg``; This indicates that this parameter or return value should be treated; in a special target-dependent fashion while emitting code for; a function call or return (usually, by putting it in a register as; opposed to memory, though some targets use it to distinguish between; two different kinds of registers).

Users; should however realize that the transformation is only a linear; approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or; more parameters is very close to a limit, where; $\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0$. Therefore, it is; recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the; limits should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits. ### How to Get the Right Answer from Minuit. `Minuit` offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms.; The `MIGRAD` algorithm is in general the best minimized for nearly all; functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line search, a; stable metric updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness.; Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first; derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very inaccurate. If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the side effects, then the; user should be aware of the following techniques to alleviate problems; caused by limits:. #### Getting the Right Minimum with Limits. If MIGRAD converges normally to a point where no parameter is near one; of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not prevented; `Minuit` from finding the right minimum. On the other hand, if one or; more parameters is near its limit at the minimum, this may be because; the true minimum is indeed at a limit, or it may be because the; minimized has become ''blocked'' at a limit. This may normally happen; only if the parameter is so close to a limit (internal value at an odd; multiple of $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ that `Minuit` prints a warning to this; effect when it prints the parameter values. The minimized can become; blocked at a limit, because at a limit the derivative seen by the; minimized $\frac{\part",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:57793,depend,depends,57793,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"are parsing is a string. The second and third parameters (which are optional) are used to specify what to; output for the ""``-help``"" option. In this case, we get a line that looks like; this:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options]. OPTIONS:; -h - Alias for -help; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename. Because we specified that the command line option should parse using the; ``string`` data type, the variable declared is automatically usable as a real; string in all contexts that a normal C++ string object may be used. For; example:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; std::ofstream Output(OutputFilename.c_str());; if (Output.good()) ...; ... There are many different options that you can use to customize the command line; option handling library, but the above example shows the general interface to; these options. The options can be specified in any order, and are specified; with helper functions like `cl::desc(...)`_, so there are no positional; dependencies to remember. The available options are discussed in detail in the; `Reference Guide`_. Continuing the example, we would like to have our compiler take an input; filename as well as an output filename, but we do not want the input filename to; be specified with a hyphen (ie, not ``-filename.c``). To support this style of; argument, the CommandLine library allows for `positional`_ arguments to be; specified for the program. These positional arguments are filled with command; line parameters that are not in option form. We use this feature like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));. This declaration indicates that the first positional argument should be treated; as the input filename.

Assertion messages and ``llvm_unreachable`` calls do not; necessarily need to follow these same styles as they are automatically; formatted, and thus these guidelines may not be suitable. ``#include`` Style; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Immediately after the `header file comment`_ (and include guards if working on a; header file), the `minimal list of #includes`_ required by the file should be; listed. We prefer these ``#include``\s to be listed in this order:. .. _Main Module Header:; .. _Local/Private Headers:. #. Main Module Header; #. Local/Private Headers; #. LLVM project/subproject headers (``clang/...``, ``lldb/...``, ``llvm/...``, etc); #. System ``#include``\s. and each category should be sorted lexicographically by the full path. The `Main Module Header`_ file applies to ``.cpp`` files which implement an; interface defined by a ``.h`` file. This ``#include`` should always be included; **first** regardless of where it lives on the file system. By including a; header file first in the ``.cpp`` files that implement the interfaces, we ensure; that the header does not have any hidden dependencies which are not explicitly; ``#include``\d in the header, but should be. It is also a form of documentation; in the ``.cpp`` file to indicate where the interfaces it implements are defined. LLVM project and subproject headers should be grouped from most specific to least; specific, for the same reasons described above. For example, LLDB depends on; both clang and LLVM, and clang depends on LLVM. So an LLDB source file should; include ``lldb`` headers first, followed by ``clang`` headers, followed by; ``llvm`` headers, to reduce the possibility (for example) of an LLDB header; accidentally picking up a missing include due to the previous inclusion of that; header in the main source file or some earl",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:16351,interface,interface,16351,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running. Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a; **`TFile`** object using the static method **`TFile::Open()`** object.; This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of **`TFile`** to handle the; request. Inheriting from the **`TFile`** class, the returned instance will have; exactly the same interface and behavior of **`TFile`**. The only difference; is that it reads and writes from a remote service.; In the example below the file is read via a web server through the TDavixFile plug-in. ### A Simple Session. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f1 = TFile::Open(""local/file.root"",""update""); root[] TFile *f2 = TFile::Open(""root://my.server.org/data/file.root"",""new""); root[] TFile *f3 = TFile::Open(""http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root""); root[] f3.ls(); TDavixFile** http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root; TDavixFile* http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root; KEY: TH1F hpx;1 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH2F hpxpy;1 py vs px; KEY: TProfile hprof;1 Profile of pz versus px; KEY: TNtuple ntuple;1 Demo ntuple; root[] hpx.Draw(); ```. ## XML Interface.

For more information about the ordering of; lookup in templates, see [temp.dep.candidate]. Unqualified lookup into dependent bases of class templates.

Alternatively, you can tell the compiler exactly where to look:. void Work(T x) {; Base<T>::DoThis(x);; Base<T>::DoThat(x);; }.

The other difference between CMake functions and macros is how arguments are; passed. Arguments to macros are not set as variables, instead dereferences to; the parameters are resolved across the macro before executing it. This can; result in some unexpected behavior if using unreferenced variables. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. macro(print_list my_list); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(""${var}""); endforeach(); endmacro(). set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list_of_numbers 1 2 3 4); print_list(my_list_of_numbers); # prints:; # a; # b; # c; # d. Generally speaking this issue is uncommon because it requires using; non-dereferenced variables with names that overlap in the parent scope, but it; is important to be aware of because it can lead to subtle bugs. LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases.

In Python, you can now get objects stored in a [RooWorkspace](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html) with the item retrieval operator, and the return value is also always downcasted to the correct type. That means in Python you don't have to use [RooWorkspace::var()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#acf5f9126ee264c234721a4ed1f9bf837) to access variables or [RooWorkspace::pdf()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#afa7384cece424a1a94a644bb05549eee) to access pdfs, but you can always get any object using square brackets. For example:; ```Python; # w is a RooWorkspace instance that contains the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` for which we want to generate toy data:; model.generate({w[""x""], w[""y""], w[""z""]}, 1000); ```. ### New PyROOT functions for interoperability with NumPy and Pandas.

The actual; application-specific (ROOT) binding is implemented in ROOTwriter; module. It contains 'binding methods' for TGeo geometry classes which; can be exported in GDML format.

The [TUnfold package](https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html) inside ROOT is upgraded from version 17.6 to version 17.9. ## Math Libraries. ### Usage of `std::span<const double>` in Minuit 2 interfaces. To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.; This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Miscellaneous. * Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name. If you want to do fast lookups by name, convert your RooArgList to a RooArgSet. * The function `RooFit::bindFunction()` now supports arbitrary many input variables when binding a Python function. * The `ExportOnly()` attribute of the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object is now switched on by default, and the associated getter and setter functions are deprecated. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36. If you want to fit the model as well instead of just exporting it to a RooWorkspace, please do so with your own code as demonstrated in the `hf001` tutorial. ### Deprecations. * The `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataSet` and `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataHist` functions ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md:4667,interface,interface,4667,README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline.

This class is the common interface between clients of alias; analysis information and the implementations providing it, and is designed to; support a wide range of implementations and clients (but currently all clients; are assumed to be flow-insensitive). In addition to simple alias analysis; information, this class exposes Mod/Ref information from those implementations; which can provide it, allowing for powerful analyses and transformations to work; well together. This document contains information necessary to successfully implement this; interface, use it, and to test both sides. It also explains some of the finer; points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview; ================================. The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__; class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations; should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and; ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref; query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in; several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a; starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual; ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to; get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple; values, values which are not :ref:`constants <constants>` are all; defined within the same function.

Prologue Data; -------------. The ``prologue`` attribute allows arbitrary code (encoded as bytes) to; be inserted prior to the function body. This can be used for enabling; function hot-patching and instrumentation. To maintain the semantics of ordinary function calls, the prologue data must; have a particular format. Specifically, it must begin with a sequence of; bytes which decode to a sequence of machine instructions, valid for the; module's target, which transfer control to the point immediately succeeding; the prologue data, without performing any other visible action. This allows; the inliner and other passes to reason about the semantics of the function; definition without needing to reason about the prologue data. Obviously this; makes the format of the prologue data highly target dependent. A trivial example of valid prologue data for the x86 architecture is ``i8 144``,; which encodes the ``nop`` instruction:. .. code-block:: text. define void @f() prologue i8 144 { ... }. Generally prologue data can be formed by encoding a relative branch instruction; which skips the metadata, as in this example of valid prologue data for the; x86_64 architecture, where the first two bytes encode ``jmp .+10``:. .. code-block:: text. %0 = type <{ i8, i8, ptr }>. define void @f() prologue %0 <{ i8 235, i8 8, ptr @md}> { ... }.

For a template, this means the lookup is; done at the point where the template is defined, not where it's; instantiated. Since Multiply hasn't been declared yet at; this point, unqualified lookup won't find it. Second, if the name is called like a function, then the compiler; also does argument-dependent lookup (ADL). (Sometimes; unqualified lookup can suppress ADL; see [basic.lookup.argdep]p3 for; more information.) In ADL, the compiler looks at the types of all the; arguments to the call.

However, the compiler doesn't do ADL until it knows all the; argument types. In our example, Multiply is called with dependent; arguments, so ADL isn't done until the template is instantiated.

It is not mandated that flushing to zero occurs, but if; a denormal output is flushed to zero, it must respect the sign; mode. Not all targets support all modes.

Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode. This prevents optimizations which might affect results if the rounding mode changes or is different from the default; for example, it prevents floating-point operations from being reordered across most calls and prevents constant-folding when the result is not exactly representable. .. option:: -ffp-model=<value>. Specify floating point behavior. ``-ffp-model`` is an umbrella; option that encompasses functionality provided by other, single; purpose, floating point options. Valid values are: ``precise``, ``strict``,; and ``fast``.; Details:. * ``precise`` Disables optimizations that are not value-safe on; floating-point data, although FP contraction (FMA) is enabled; (``-ffp-contract=on``). This is the default behavior. This value resets; ``-fmath-errno`` to its target-dependent default.; * ``strict`` Enables ``-frounding-math`` and; ``-ffp-exception-behavior=strict``, and disables contractions (FMA). All; of the ``-ffast-math`` enablements are disabled. Enables; ``STDC FENV_ACCESS``: by default ``FENV_ACCESS`` is disabled. This option; setting behaves as though ``#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON`` appeared at the; top of the source file.; * ``fast`` Behaves identically to specifying both ``-ffast-math`` and; ``ffp-contract=fast``. Note: If your command line specifies multiple instances; of the ``-ffp-model`` option, or if your command line option specifies; ``-ffp-model`` and later on the command line selects a floating point; option that has the effect of negating part of the ``ffp-model`` that; has been selected, then the compiler will issue a diagnostic warning; that the override has occurred. ..

See 2003-05-31-LongShifts for; an example. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. With a copying garbage collector, derived pointers must not be retained across; collector safe points; the collector could move the objects and invalidate the; derived pointer. This is bad enough in the first place, but safe points can; crop up unpredictably. Consider:. %array = load { i32, [0 x %obj] }** %array_addr; %nth_el = getelementptr { i32, [0 x %obj] }* %array, i32 0, i32 %n; %old = load %obj** %nth_el; %z = div i64 %x, %y; store %obj* %new, %obj** %nth_el. If the i64 division is lowered to a libcall, then a safe point will (must); appear for the call site. If a collection occurs, %array and %nth_el no longer; point into the correct object. The fix for this is to copy address calculations so that dependent pointers; are never live across safe point boundaries. But the loads cannot be copied; like this if there was an intervening store, so may be hard to get right. Only a concurrent mutator can trigger a collection at the libcall safe point.; So single-threaded programs do not have this requirement, even with a copying; collector.

Create a medium from one of the existing materials from the; ""*Medium*"" category. You will notice that some categories as ""*Volume*""; and ""*Medium*"" are inactive at the beginning because at that time there; is no material yet (for making a medium) and no shape (for making a; volume). These categories are dynamically activated once all the; required components are defined. 5. Create a volume from the ""*Volumes*"" category. You will notice that; contrary to the other editors, the volume editor is opened in a tab, not; transient - this is because it is more complex. 6.

Integrability,"ation; of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then; `Minuit` (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely.; The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the; parameterization. `Minuit` cannot do this itself. #### Numerical Inaccuracies. It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due; to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user; function), or not enough precision. This is unlikely in general, but; becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or; if the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of; magnitude), and correlations are large. In any case, whether the; non-positive-definiteness is real or only numerical is largely; irrelevant, since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable; and the minimum suspicious. #### An Ill-posed Problem. For questions of parameter dependence, see the discussion above on; positive-definiteness. Possible other mathematical problems are the; following:. - Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of; exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and; lose accuracy. - Starting too far from the solution - the function may have; unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. ## Minuit2 Package. `Minuit2` is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of; the popular `MINUIT` minimization package.

Integrability,"ations are required to be instantiated separately (this; includes default arguments and exception specifications), and such; instantiations update the existing declaration. These cases tend to be fragile; mutable AST state should be avoided where; possible. As a consequence of this design principle, we typically do not provide setters; for AST state. (Some are provided for short-term modifications intended to be; used immediately after an AST node is created and before it's ""published"" as; part of the complete AST, or where language semantics require after-the-fact; updates.). Faithfulness; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AST intends to provide a representation of the program that is faithful to; the original source. We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally and wrap the result; in a construct representing the original source form. For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:.

In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more.

The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them.

In the example below the entire array is accumulated into the variable 'sum'.; This is inefficient because only a single execution port can be used by the processor.; By unrolling the code the Loop Vectorizer allows two or more execution ports; to be used simultaneously. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int *A, int n) {; unsigned sum = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i); sum += A[i];; return sum;; }. The Loop Vectorizer uses a cost model to decide when it is profitable to unroll loops.; The decision to unroll the loop depends on the register pressure and the generated code size. Epilogue Vectorization; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When vectorizing a loop, often a scalar remainder (epilogue) loop is necessary; to execute tail iterations of the loop if the loop trip count is unknown or it; does not evenly divide the vectorization and unroll factors. When the; vectorization and unroll factors are large, it's possible for loops with smaller; trip counts to end up spending most of their time in the scalar (rather than; the vector) code. In order to address this issue, the inner loop vectorizer is; enhanced with a feature that allows it to vectorize epilogue loops with a; vectorization and unroll factor combination that makes it more likely for small; trip count loops to still execute in vectorized code. The diagram below shows; the CFG for a typical epilogue vectorized loop with runtime checks. As; illustrated the control flow is structured in a way that avoids duplicating the; runtime pointer checks and optimizes the path",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Vectorizers.rst:11148,depend,depends,11148,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Vectorizers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Vectorizers.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"ave this restriction. Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow. How can I tell if my front-end is following the rules?; ------------------------------------------------------. There is currently no checker for the getelementptr rules. Currently, the only; way to do this is to manually check each place in your front-end where; GetElementPtr operators are cre",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:17778,wrap,wraps,17778,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['wrap'],['wraps']

Clients are free to create new; threads to run materializers, or to send the work to a work queue for a thread; pool (this is what LLJIT/LLLazyJIT do). Top Level APIs; ==============. Many of ORC's top-level APIs are visible in the example above:. - *ExecutionSession* represents the JIT'd program and provides context for the; JIT: It contains the JITDylibs, error reporting mechanisms, and dispatches the; materializers. - *JITDylibs* provide the symbol tables. - *Layers* (ObjLinkingLayer and CXXLayer) are wrappers around compilers and; allow clients to add uncompiled program representations supported by those; compilers to JITDylibs. - *ResourceTrackers* allow you to remove code. Several other important APIs are used explicitly. JIT clients need not be aware; of them, but Layer authors will use them:. - *MaterializationUnit* - When XXXLayer::add is invoked it wraps the given; program representation (in this example, C++ source) in a MaterializationUnit,; which is then stored in the JITDylib. MaterializationUnits are responsible for; describing the definitions they provide, and for unwrapping the program; representation and passing it back to the layer when compilation is required; (this ownership shuffle makes writing thread-safe layers easier, since the; ownership of the program representation will be passed back on the stack,; rather than having to be fished out of a Layer member, which would require; synchronization). - *MaterializationResponsibility* - When a MaterializationUnit hands a program; representation back to the layer it comes with an associated; MaterializationResponsibility object. This object tracks the definitions; that must be materialized and provides a way to notify the JITDylib once they; are either successfully materialized or a failure occurs.

The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow dependencies. Data values are simple; edges with an integer or floating point value type. Control edges are; represented as ""chain"" edges which are of type ``MVT::Other``. These edges; provide an ordering between nodes that have side effects (such as loads, stores,; calls, returns, etc). All nodes that have side effects should take a token; chain as input and produce a new one as output. By convention, token chain; inputs are always operand #0, and chain results are always the last value; produced by an operation.

Stream 0: ceil(1000 / 4096) = 1 block. Stream 1: ceil(8000 / 4096) = 2 blocks. Stream 2: ceil(16000 / 4096) = 4 blocks. Stream 3: ceil(9000 / 4096) = 3 blocks. In total, 10 blocks are used. Let's see what the stream directory might look; like:. .. code-block:: c++. struct StreamDirectory {; ulittle32_t NumStreams = 4;; ulittle32_t StreamSizes[] = {1000, 8000, 16000, 9000};; ulittle32_t StreamBlocks[][] = {; {4},; {5, 6},; {11, 9, 7, 8},; {10, 15, 12}; };; };.

Alignment and Block Boundaries; ==============================; As may be clear by now, it is possible for a single field (whether it be a high; level record, a long string field, or even a single ``uint16``) to begin and; end in separate blocks. For example, if the block size is 4096 bytes, and a; ``uint16`` field begins at the last byte of the current block, then it would; need to end on the first byte of the next block. Since blocks are not; necessarily contiguously laid out in the file, this means that both the consumer; and the producer of an MSF file must be prepared to split data apart; accordingly. In the aforementioned example, the high byte of the ``uint16``; would be written to the last byte of block N, and the low byte would be written; to the first byte of block N+1, which could be tens of thousands of bytes later; (or even earlier!) in the file, depending on what the stream directory says.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PDB/MsfFile.rst:7672,depend,depending,7672,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PDB/MsfFile.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PDB/MsfFile.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']

We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library.

The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map.

Therefore, if $\mbox{MIGRAD}$; reports that it has found a non-positive–definite covariance matrix,; this may be a sign of one or more of the following:. - **A non–physical region.** On its way to the minimum,; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ may have traversed a region which has unphysical; behaviour, which is of course not a serious problem as long as it; recovers and leaves such a region. - **An underdetermined problem.** If the matrix is not; positive–definite even at the minimum, this may mean that the; solution is not well–defined, for example that there are more; unknowns than there are data points, or that the parametrization of; the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then M; (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely, and the; error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under-determinedness by reformulating the; parametrization. M cannot do this itself, but it can provide some; hints (contours, global correlation coefficients, eigenvalues) which; can help the clever user to find out what is wrong. - **Numerical inaccuracies.** It is possible that the apparent lack of; positive–definiteness is in fact only due to excessive roundoff; errors in numerical calculations, either in $\mbox{FCN}$ or in M; .

For a RooSimultaneous consisting of exclusively; extended terms it is now possible to generate a mixed binned/unbinned datasets. Components defined; by a binned pdf at the top level are automatically generated binned (unless AutoBinned(false) is set); but it is also possible to generate other component pdfs forcibly binned by adding GenBinned(tagname); to generate(). In that case all component pdfs labeled with pdf->setAttribute(tagname) will be generated; binned. To generate all component binned, the shorthand method AllBinned() can be used.

There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------. Any functions defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``); must not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header; file for that function is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms.

Integrability,"ble* --- is automatically generated by parsing; all of the headers in the source file, up to and including the last; ``#include``. When only the source file changes (and none of the headers it; depends on), reparsing of that source file can use the precompiled preamble and; start parsing after the ``#include``\ s, so parsing time is proportional to the; size of the source file (rather than all of its includes). However, the; compilation of that translation unit may already use a precompiled header: in; this case, Clang will create the precompiled preamble as a chained precompiled; header that refers to the original precompiled header. This drastically; reduces the time needed to serialize the precompiled preamble for use in; reparsing. Chained precompiled headers get their name because each precompiled header can; depend on one other precompiled header, forming a chain of dependencies. A; translation unit will then include the precompiled header that starts the chain; (i.e., nothing depends on it). This linearity of dependencies is important for; the semantic model of chained precompiled headers, because the most-recent; precompiled header can provide information that overrides the information; provided by the precompiled headers it depends on, just like a header file; ``B.h`` that includes another header ``A.h`` can modify the state produced by; parsing ``A.h``, e.g., by ``#undef``'ing a macro defined in ``A.h``. There are several ways in which chained precompiled headers generalize the AST; file model:. Numbering of IDs; Many different kinds of entities --- identifiers, declarations, types, etc.; --- have ID numbers that start at 1 or some other predefined constant and; grow upward. Each precompiled header records the maximum ID number it has; assigned in each category.

Integrability,"blocks. High-Level Design; =================. The DDG and the PDG are both directed graphs and they extend the; ``DirectedGraph`` class. Each implementation extends its corresponding; node and edge types resulting in the inheritance relationship depicted; in the UML diagram below:. .. image:: uml_nodes_and_edges.png. Graph Construction; ------------------. The graph build algorithm considers dependencies between elements of; a given set of instructions or basic blocks. Any dependencies coming; into or going out of instructions that do not belong to that range; are ignored. The steps in the build algorithm for the DDG are very; similar to the steps in the build algorithm for the PDG. As such,; one of the design goals is to reuse the build algorithm code to; allow creation of both DDG and PDG representations while allowing; the two implementations to define their own distinct and independent; node and edge types. This is achieved by using the well-known builder; design pattern to isolate the construction of the dependence graph; from its concrete representation. The following UML diagram depicts the overall structure of the design; pattern as it applies to the dependence graph implementation. .. image:: uml_builder_pattern.png. Notice that the common code for building the two types of graphs are; provided in the ``DependenceGraphBuilder`` class, while the ``DDGBuilder``; and ``PDGBuilder`` control some aspects of how the graph is constructed; by the way of overriding virtual methods defined in ``DependenceGraphBuilder``. Note also that the steps and the names used in this diagram are for; illustrative purposes and may be different from those in the actual; implementation. Design Trade-offs; -----------------.

Integrability,"bs: (1) Running every IR Module that is emitted via this; layer through the transform function object, and (2) implementing the ORC; ``IRLayer`` interface (which itself conforms to the general ORC Layer concept,; more on that below). Most of the class is straightforward: a typedef for the; transform function, a constructor to initialize the members, a setter for the; transform function value, and a default no-op transform. The most important; method is ``emit`` as this is half of our IRLayer interface. The emit method; applies our transform to each module that it is called on and, if the transform; succeeds, passes the transformed module to the base layer. If the transform; fails, our emit function calls; ``MaterializationResponsibility::failMaterialization`` (this JIT clients who; may be waiting on other threads know that the code they were waiting for has; failed to compile) and logs the error with the execution session before bailing; out.

This code, from ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Layer.cpp``, adds a; ThreadSafeModule to a given JITDylib by wrapping it up in a; ``MaterializationUnit`` (in this case a ``BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit``).; Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method. These two operations, ``add`` and ``emit``, together constitute the layer; concept: A layer is a way to wrap a part of a compiler pipeline (in this case; the ""opt"" phase of an LLVM compiler) whose API is opaque to ORC with an; interface that ORC can call as needed.

Integrability,"bsL` class is implemented for four kinds of likelihoods: binned, unbinned, ""subsidiary"" (an optimization for numerical stability that gathers components like global observables) and ""sum"" (over multiple components of the other types), in the correspondingly named classes `RooBinnedL`, `RooUnbinnedL`, `RooSubsidiaryL` and `RooSumL`.; These classes provide a `evaluatePartition` function that allows for computing them in parallelizable chunks that can be used by the calculator classes as they see fit. On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a likelihood builder `buildLikelihood`, as a free function in the namespace.; This function analyzes the `pdf` and automatically constructs the proper likelihood, built; up from the available `RooAbsL` subclasses. The new classes are not per se meant to be used outside of `RooMinimizer`, although they can be.; The main reason is that they do not behave as regular `RooAbsReal` objects, but have their own interface which was kept to the minimum necessary for interacting with `RooMinimizer` as an object that encodes purely the statistics concepts.; However, we do provide the `RooRealL` class, which holds a `RooAbsL` object, but does inherit from `RooAbsReal` as well, so that it can be used in contexts where you would normally use a `RooAbsReal` (like for plotting). ### Usage example: Create an unbinned likelihood object; It is possible to directly create `RooAbsL` based likelihood objects from a pdf and dataset, in this example a `RooUnbinnedL` type:; ``` {.cpp}; RooAbsPdf *pdf;; RooDataSet *data;; std::tie(pdf, data) = generate_some_unbinned_pdf_and_dataset(with, some, parameters);. RooFit::TestStatistics::RooUnbinnedL likelihood(pdf, data);; ```.

Whether the compiler can optimize such run-time checks depends on how the upper; bound of the pointer is derived. If the source pointer has ``__sized_by``,; ``__counted_by``, or a variant of such, the compiler assumes that the upper; bound calculation doesn't overflow, e.g., ``ptr + size`` (where the type of; ``ptr`` is ``void *__sized_by(size)``), because when the ``__sized_by`` pointer; is initialized, ``-fbounds-safety`` inserts run-time checks to ensure that ``ptr; + size`` doesn't overflow and that ``size >= 0``. Assuming the upper bound calculation doesn't overflow, the compiler can simplify; the trap condition ``upper(tmp_ptr) - tmp_ptr < tmp_count`` to ``size <; tmp_count`` so if both ``size`` and ``tmp_count`` values are known at compile; time such that ``0 <= tmp_count <= size``, the optimizer can remove the check. ``ptr + size`` may still overflow if the ``__sized_by`` pointer is created from; code that doesn't enable ``-fbounds-safety``, which is undefined behavior.

If we just want to build the clang; binary, our target name is ""clang"" and we run:. .. code:: console. $ ninja clang. The first time we build will be very slow - Clang + LLVM is a lot of; code. But incremental builds are fast: ninja will only rebuild the parts; that have changed. When it finally finishes you should have a working; clang binary. Try running:. .. code:: console. $ bin/clang --version. There's also a target for building and running all the clang tests:. .. code:: console. $ ninja check-clang. This is a common pattern in LLVM: check-llvm is all the checks for core,; other projects have targets like check-lldb. Making changes; ==============. Edit; ----.

It this case, the top and bottom quadrilaterals; become triangles, segments or points.

There are no DWARF extensions needed to support wide pointers.; In our implementation, LLDB recognizes wide pointer types by name and; reconstructs them as wide pointer Clang AST types for use in the expression; evaluator. External bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Similar to internal bounds annotations, external bound annotations are described; as a typedef to their underlying pointer type in the debug info, and the bounds; are encoded as strings in the typedef’s name (e.g.,; ``__bounds_safety$counted_by:N``). Recognizing ``-fbounds-safety`` traps; -------------------------------------. Clang emits debug info for ``-fbounds-safety`` traps as inlined functions, where; the function name encodes the error message. LLDB implements a frame recognizer; to surface a human-readable error cause to the end user. A debug info consumer; that is unaware of this sees an inlined function whose name encodes an error; message (e.g., : ``__bounds_safety$Bounds check failed``). Expression Parsing; ------------------. In our implementation, LLDB’s expression evaluator does not enable the; ``-fbounds-safety`` language option because it’s currently unable to fully; reconstruct the pointers with external bounds annotations, and also because the; evaluator operates in C++ mode, utilizing C++ reference types, while; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not currently support C++. This means LLDB’s expression; evaluator can only evaluate a subset of the ``-fbounds-safety`` language model.; Specifically, it’s capable of evaluating the wide pointers that already exist in; the source code.

In many cases clang can successfully; use this multiarch support when ``--gcc-toolchain=`` and ``--sysroot=`` are not supplied.; Unfortunately clang adds ``/usr/local/include`` before; ``/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf`` leading to errors when compiling the hosts; header files. The multiarch support is not sufficient to build the builtins you will need to; use a separate arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain.

Normally, any data that has lifetime beyond the local; variables on the thread's private stack are shared among all threads; within the process. Thread-specific data is a form of static or global; data that is maintained on a per-thread basis. That is, each thread gets; its own private copy of the data. Left to their own devices, threads execute independently.; **`Synchronization`** is the work that must be done when there are, in; fact, interdependencies that require some form of communication among; threads. Synchronization tools include mutexes, semaphores, condition; variables, and other variations on locking. A **`critical section`** is a section of code that accesses a; non-sharable resource. To ensure correct code, only one thread at a time; may execute in a critical section. In other words, the section is not; reentrant. A **`mutex`**, or mutual exclusion lock, is a synchronization object; with two states locked and unlocked. A mutex is usually used to ensure; that only one thread at a time executes some critical section of code.; Before entering a critical section, a thread will attempt to lock the; mutex, which guards that section. If the mutex is already locked, the; thread will block until the mutex is unlocked, at which time it will; lock the mutex, execute the critical section, and unlock the mutex upon; leaving the critical section. A **`semaphore`** is a synchronization mechanism that starts out; initialized to some positive value. A thread may ask to wait on a; semaphore in which case the thread blocks until the value of the; semaphore is positive. At that time the semaphore count is decremented; and the thread continues.

This approach is effective when all code is mitigated in this fashion, and can; even survive very limited reaches into unmitigated code (the state will; round-trip in and back out of an unmitigated function, it just won't be; updated). But it does have some limitations. There is a cost to merging the; state into `%rsp` and it doesn't insulate mitigated code from misspeculation in; an unmitigated caller. There is also an advantage to using this form of interprocedural mitigation: by; forming these invalid stack pointer addresses we can prevent speculative; returns from successfully reading speculatively written values to the actual; stack. This works first by forming a data-dependency between computing the; address of the return address on the stack and our predicate state. And even; when satisfied, if a misprediction causes the state to be poisoned the; resulting stack pointer will be invalid. ##### Rewrite API of internal functions to directly propagate predicate state. (Not yet implemented.). We have the option with internal functions to directly adjust their API to; accept the predicate as an argument and return it.

The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code. So we have to keep the; code copies in memory near the original code (they can't be far enough; away that a single pc-relative branch would not work.) Malloc() or; data region space is too far away. this impacts the design of the ; trace cache. We use a dummy function that is full of a bunch of for loops which we; overwrite with trace-cache code. The trace manager keeps track of; whether or not we have enough space in the trace cache, etc. The trace insertion routine takes an original start address, a vector; of machine instructions representing the trace, index of branches and; their corresponding absolute targets, and index of calls and their; corresponding absolute targets. The trace insertion routine is responsible for inserting branches from; the beginning of the original code to the beginning of the optimized; trace. This is because at some point the trace cache may run out of; space and it may have to evict a trace, at which point the branch to; the trace would also have to be removed. It uses a round-robin; replacement policy; we have found that this is almost as good as LRU; and better than random (especially because of problems fitting the new; trace in.). We cannot deal with discontiguous trace cache areas. The trace cache; is supposed to be cache-line-aligned, but it is not page-aligned.

We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

When receiving such an argument, ARC releases the argument at the end of the; function, subject to the usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a caller to a callee. The; most common scenario here is passing the ``self`` parameter to ``init``, but; it is useful to generalize. Typically, local optimization will remove any; extra retains and releases: on the caller side the retain will be merged with; a +1 source, and on the callee side the release will be rolled into the; initialization of the parameter. The implicit ``self`` parameter of a method may be marked as consumed by adding; ``__attribute__((ns_consumes_self))`` to the method declaration. Methods in; the ``init`` :ref:`family <arc.method-families>` are treated as if they were; implicitly marked with this attribute. It is undefined behavior if an Objective-C message send to a method with; ``ns_consumed`` parameters (other than self) is made with a null receiver. It; is undefined behavior if the method to which an Objective-C message send; statically resolves to has a different set of ``ns_consumed`` parameters than; the method it dynamically resolves to.

Integrability,"ch chained precompiled headers generalize the AST; file model:. Numbering of IDs; Many different kinds of entities --- identifiers, declarations, types, etc.; --- have ID numbers that start at 1 or some other predefined constant and; grow upward. Each precompiled header records the maximum ID number it has; assigned in each category. Then, when a new precompiled header is generated; that depends on (chains to) another precompiled header, it will start; counting at the next available ID number. This way, one can determine, given; an ID number, which AST file actually contains the entity. Name lookup; When writing a chained precompiled header, Clang attempts to write only; information that has changed from the precompiled header on which it is; based. This changes the lookup algorithm for the various tables, such as the; :ref:`identifier table <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the search starts at the; most-recent precompiled header. If no entry is found, lookup then proceeds; to the identifier table in the precompiled header it depends on, and so one.; Once a lookup succeeds, that result is considered definitive, overriding any; results from earlier precompiled headers. Update records; There are various ways in which a later precompiled header can modify the; entities described in an earlier precompiled header. For example, later; precompiled headers can add entries into the various name-lookup tables for; the translation unit or namespaces, or add new categories to an Objective-C; class. Each of these updates is captured in an ""update record"" that is; stored in the chained precompiled header file and will be loaded along with; the original entity. .. _pchinternals-modules:. Modules; -------. Modules generalize the chained precompiled header model yet further, from a; linear chain of precompiled headers to an arbitrary directed acyclic graph; (DAG) of AST files.

Integrability,"ch employed by many compilers to reduce compilation; time. The underlying motivation of the approach is that it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:46747,interface,interface,46747,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"ch harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions.

C++ Standard Library; --------------------. Instead of implementing custom data structures, we encourage the use of C++; standard library facilities or LLVM support libraries whenever they are; available for a particular task. LLVM and related projects emphasize and rely; on the standard library facilities and the LLVM support libraries as much as; possible. LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT>`_); implement specialized data structures or functionality missing in the standard; library. Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and; follow the expected standard interface, when there is one. When both C++ and the LLVM support libraries provide similar functionality, and; there isn't a specific reason to favor the C++ implementation, it is generally; preferable to use the LLVM library. For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``. We explicitly avoid some standard facilities, like the I/O streams, and instead; use LLVM's streams library (raw_ostream_).

Integrability,"changed. General performance tuning of RooFit to reduce computational overhead. Extensive profiling of; CPU times in call graphas and analysis heap memory use have been performed and many small ; changes have been made to make the code more efficient and use less memory. RooStats Package; AsymptoticCalculator. New Class for doing an hypothesis tests using the asymptotic likelihood formulae, described in the paper from; G. Cowan, K. Cranmer, E. Gross and O. Vitells, Asymptotic formulae for likelihood- based tests of new physics,; Eur. Phys. J., C71 (1), 2011.; The class computes the p-value for the null and also for the alternate using the Asimov data set. In this; differs form the ProfileLikelihoodCalculator which computes only the p-values for the null hypothesis.; The Asimov data set is generated with the utility function AsymptoticCalculator::MakeAsimovData and then; it is used to evaluate the likelihood. ; ; This class implements the HypoTestCalculatorGeneric interface and can be used as an alternative Hypothesis test; calculator in the HypoTestInverter class. It can then plugged in the HypoTestInverter for computing asymptotic CLs and CLs+b; limits. In this way the limits will be computed by just performing a fit for each test parameter value and without; generating any toys. . The class can be used via the StandardHypothesisTest.C tutorial passing a value of 2 for the; calculator type. . RooStats Utils. Add a utility function (from G. Petrucciani), RooStats::MakeNuisancePdf, which given a model configuration (or the global pdf and the; observables), factorizes from the model pdf the constraint probability density functions for the nuisance parameters; and builds a global nuisance pdf. This function can then be used in the HybridCalculator or in the BayesianCalculator; with the option ""TOYMC"".; . HypotestInverter and HypoTestInverterResult.

In the following example code, the x variable is used before it is; defined:. int f0() {; __block int x;; return ^(){ return x; }();; }. By an accident of implementation, GCC and llvm-gcc unintentionally always; zero initialized __block variables. However, any program which depends; on this behavior is relying on unspecified compiler behavior. Programs must; explicitly initialize all local block variables before they are used, as with; other local variables.; Clang does not zero initialize local block variables, and programs which rely; on such behavior will most likely break when built with Clang. Inline assembly. In general, Clang is highly compatible with the GCC inline assembly; extensions, allowing the same set of constraints, modifiers and operands as GCC; inline assembly.; On targets that use the integrated assembler (such as most X86 targets),; inline assembly is run through the integrated assembler instead of your system; assembler (which is most commonly ""gas"", the GNU assembler). The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");. Both clang and GAS accept the first instruction: because the first; instruction uses the 8-bit %al register as an operand, it is clear that; it is an 8-bit add. The second instruction is accepted by both because the ""w""; suffix indicates that it is a 16-bit add. The last instruction is accepted by; GAS even though there is nothing that specifies the size of the instruction (and; the assembler randomly picks a 32-bit add). Because it is ambiguous, Clang; rejects the instruction with this error message:. <inline asm>:3:1: err",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html:7464,integrat,integrated,7464,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,4,['integrat'],['integrated']

RooFit groups model variables into *observables* and *parameters*, depending on if their values are stored in the dataset.; For fits with parameter constraints, there is a third kind of variables, called *global observables*.; These represent the results of auxiliary measurements that constrain the nuisance parameters.; In the RooFit implementation, a likelihood is generally the sum of two terms:; * the likelihood of the data given the parameters, where the normalization set is the set of observables (implemented by `RooNLLVar`); * the constraint term, where the normalization set is the set of *global observables* (implemented by `RooConstraintSum`). Before this release, the global observable values were always taken from the model/pdf.; With this release, a mechanism is added to store a snapshot of global observables in any `RooDataSet` or `RooDataHist`.; For toy studies where the global observables assume a different values for each toy, the bookkeeping of the set of global observables and in particular their values is much easier with this ch",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:26866,depend,depending,26866,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"cies. To enforce; this, we wrap all constructor calls of all AST nodes in; ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()``. This wrapper ensures that all newly created; declarations are immediately marked as imported; also, if a declaration is; already marked as imported then we just return its counterpart in the ""to""; context. Consequently, calling a declaration's ``::Create()`` function directly; would lead to errors, please don't do that!. Even with the use of ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()`` there is still a; probability of having an infinite import recursion if things are imported from; each other in wrong way. Imagine that during the import of ``A``, the import of; ``B`` is requested before we could create the node for ``A`` (the constructor; needs a reference to ``B``). And the same could be true for the import of ``B``; (``A`` is requested to be imported before we could create the node for ``B``).; In case of the :ref:`templated-described swing <templated>` we take; extra attention to break the cyclical dependency: we import and set the; described template only after the ``CXXRecordDecl`` is created. As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we rec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:99982,depend,dependency,99982,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Interoperability with std::error_code and ErrorOr; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Many existing LLVM APIs use ``std::error_code`` and its partner ``ErrorOr<T>``; (which plays the same role as ``Expected<T>``, but wraps a ``std::error_code``; rather than an ``Error``). The infectious nature of error types means that an; attempt to change one of these functions to return ``Error`` or ``Expected<T>``; instead often results in an avalanche of changes to callers, callers of callers,; and so on. (The first such attempt, returning an ``Error`` from; MachOObjectFile's constructor, was abandoned after the diff reached 3000 lines,; impacted half a dozen libraries, and was still growing). To solve this problem, the ``Error``/``std::error_code`` interoperability requirement was; introduced. Two pairs of functions allow any ``Error`` value to be converted to a; ``std::error_code``, any ``Expected<T>`` to be converted to an ``ErrorOr<T>``, and vice; versa:. .. code-block:: c++. std::error_code errorToErrorCode(Error Err);; Error errorCodeToError(std::error_code EC);. template <typename T> ErrorOr<T> expectedToErrorOr(Expected<T> TOrErr);; template <typename T> Expected<T> errorOrToExpected(ErrorOr<T> TOrEC);. Using these APIs it is easy to make surgical patches that update individual; functions from ``std::error_code`` to ``Error``, and from ``ErrorOr<T>`` to; ``Expected<T>``.

CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large.

Integrability,"ciple needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------. Implementations of the Support Library interface are separated by their general; class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes are defined; but more could be added for other operating system classifications. To; distinguish which implementation to compile, the code in ``lib/Support`` uses; the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``_WIN32`` ``#defines``. Each source file in; ``lib/Support``, after implementing the generic (operating system independent); functionality needs to include the correct implementation using a set of; ``#if defined(LLVM_ON_XYZ)`` directives. For example, if we had; ``lib/Support/Path.cpp``, we'd expect to see in that file:. .. code-block:: c++. #if defined(LLVM_ON_UNIX); #include ""Unix/Path.inc""; #endif; #if defined(_WIN32); #include ""Windows/Path.inc""; #endif.

Let me give you an example:. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""clang/Tooling/Tooling.h"". TEST(runToolOnCode, CanSyntaxCheckCode) {; // runToolOnCode returns whether the action was correctly run over the; // given code.; EXPECT_TRUE(runToolOnCode(std::make_unique<clang::SyntaxOnlyAction>(), ""class X {};""));; }. Writing a standalone tool; -------------------------. Once you unit tested your ``FrontendAction`` to the point where it cannot; possibly break, it's time to create a standalone tool. For a standalone tool; to run clang, it first needs to figure out what command line arguments to use; for a specified file. To that end we create a ``CompilationDatabase``. There; are different ways to create a compilation database, and we need to support all; of them depending on command-line options. There's the ``CommonOptionsParser``; class that takes the responsibility to parse command-line parameters related to; compilation databases and inputs, so that all tools share the implementation. Parsing common tools options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``CompilationDatabase`` can be read from a build directory or the command line.; Using ``CommonOptionsParser`` allows for explicit specification of a compile; command line, specification of build path using the ``-p`` command-line option,; and automatic location of the compilation database using source files paths. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""clang/Tooling/CommonOptionsParser.h""; #include ""llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"". using namespace clang::tooling;. // Apply a custom category to all command-line options so that they are the; // only ones displayed.; static llvm::cl::OptionCategory MyToolCategory(""my-tool options"");. int main(int argc, const char **argv) {; // Common",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst:1618,depend,depending,1618,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']

Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============.

Exceptions are treated *normally* in that when; thrown they pop stack frames until a catch clause is found. Objective-C Extensions; ======================. Objective-C extends the definition of a Block reference type to be; that also of id. A variable or expression of Block type may be; messaged or used as a parameter wherever an id may be. The converse is; also true. Block references may thus appear as properties and are; subject to the assign, retain, and copy attribute logic that is; reserved for objects. All Blocks are constructed to be Objective-C objects regardless of; whether the Objective-C runtime is operational in the program or; not. Blocks using automatic (stack) memory are objects and may be; messaged, although they may not be assigned into ``__weak`` locations; if garbage collection is enabled. Within a Block literal expression within a method definition; references to instance variables are also imported into the lexical; scope of the compound statement. These variables are implicitly; qualified as references from self, and so self is imported as a const; copy. The net effect is that instance variables can be mutated. The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst:8790,message,messaged,8790,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst,1,['message'],['messaged']

Flow Mapping; ------------; A YAML ""flow mapping"" is a mapping that uses the inline notation; (e.g { x: 1, y: 0 } ) when written to YAML. To specify that a type should be; written in YAML using flow mapping, your MappingTraits specialization should; add ""static const bool flow = true;"". For instance:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {; ...; };. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; ...; }. static const bool flow = true;; }. Flow mappings are subject to line wrapping according to the Output object; configuration. Sequence; ========. To be translated to or from a YAML sequence for your type T you must specialize; llvm::yaml::SequenceTraits on T and implement two methods:; ``size_t size(IO &io, T&)`` and; ``T::value_type& element(IO &io, T&, size_t indx)``.

The size() method returns how many elements are currently in your sequence.; The element() method returns a reference to the i'th element in the sequence.; When parsing YAML, the element() method may be called with an index one bigger; than the current size.

It is an error if a stack based C++ object is used within; a block if it does not have a copy constructor. In addition both copy and; destroy helper routines must be synthesized for the block to support the; ``Block_copy()`` operation, and the flags work marked with the (1<<26) bit in; addition to the (1<<25) bit. The copy helper should call the constructor using; appropriate offsets of the variable within the supplied stack based block source; and heap based destination for all ``const`` constructed copies, and similarly; should call the destructor in the destroy routine.

Integrability,"cking the previously; mentioned properties, we have to check for equivalent template; parameters/arguments, etc. The structural equivalent check can be and is used independently from the; ASTImporter, e.g. the ``clang::Sema`` class uses it also. The equivalence of nodes may depend on the equivalency of other pairs of nodes.; Thus, the check is implemented as a parallel graph traversal. We traverse; through the nodes of both graphs at the same time. The actual implementation is; similar to breadth-first-search. Let's say we start the traverse with the <A,B>; pair of nodes. Whenever the traversal reaches a pair <X,Y> then the following; statements are true:. - A and X are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - B and Y are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - A and B may or may not be from the same ASTContext.; - if A == X and B == Y (pointer equivalency) then (there is a cycle during the; traverse). - A and B are structurally equivalent if and only if. - All dependent nodes on the path from <A,B> to <X,Y> are structurally; equivalent.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`clang` is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler which encompasses; preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code generation, assembly, and linking.; Depending on which high-level mode setting is passed, Clang will stop before; doing a full link. While Clang is highly integrated, it is important to; understand the stages of compilation, to understand how to invoke it. These; stages are:. Driver; The clang executable is actually a small driver which controls the overall; execution of other tools such as the compiler, assembler and linker.; Typically you do not need to interact with the driver, but you; transparently use it to run the other tools. Preprocessing; This stage handles tokenization of the input source file, macro expansion,; #include expansion and handling of other preprocessor directives. The; output of this stage is typically called a "".i"" (for C), "".ii"" (for C++),; "".mi"" (for Objective-C), or "".mii"" (for Objective-C++) file. Parsing and Semantic Analysis; This stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a; parse tree. Once in the form of a parse tree, it applies semantic; analysis to compute types for expressions as well and determine whether; the code is well formed. This stage is responsible for generating most of; the compiler warnings as well as parse errors. The output of this stage is; an ""Abstract Syntax Tree"" (AST). Code Generation and Optimization; This stage translates an AST into low-level intermediate code (known as; ""LLVM IR"") and ultimately to machine code. This phase is responsible for; optimizing the generated code and handling target-specific code generation.; The output of this stage is typically called a "".s"" file or ""assembly"" file.

Change ""C-K"" to another binding if; you need :program:`clang-format` on a different key (C-K stands for Ctrl+k). With this integration you can press the bound key and clang-format will; format the current line in NORMAL and INSERT mode or the selected region in; VISUAL mode. The line or region is extended to the next bigger syntactic; entity. It operates on the current, potentially unsaved buffer and does not create; or save any files. To revert a formatting, just undo. An alternative option is to format changes when saving a file and thus to; have a zero-effort integration into the coding workflow. To do this, add this to; your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. function! Formatonsave(); let l:formatdiff = 1; pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py; endfunction; autocmd BufWritePre *.h,*.cc,*.cpp call Formatonsave(). Emacs Integration; =================.

(load ""<path-to-clang>/tools/clang-format/clang-format.el""); (global-set-key [C-M-tab] 'clang-format-region). This binds the function `clang-format-region` to C-M-tab, which then formats the; current line or selected region.

The AppleScript to do this integration can be found at; `clang/tools/clang-format/clang-format-bbedit.applescript`; place a copy in; `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts`, and edit the path within it to; point to your local copy of :program:`clang-format`.

Some targets support embedding of strings into object files to indicate; a set of libraries to add to the link.

The list is encoded in the IR using named metadata with the name; ``!llvm.dependent-libraries``. Each operand is expected to be a metadata node; which should contain a single string operand. For example, the following metadata section contains two library specifiers::. !0 = !{!""a library specifier""}; !1 = !{!""another library specifier""}; !llvm.dependent-libraries = !{ !0, !1 }.

To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.; This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Miscellaneous. * Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name.

You need to; make a build directory and run CMake from it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================.

The entry points specified in the interface of ``lib/Support`` must be aimed at; completing some reasonably high level task needed by LLVM. We do not want to; simply wrap each operating system call. It would be preferable to wrap several; operating system calls that are always used in conjunction with one another by; LLVM. For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to; complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the following; operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and ``wait``. The; correct thing for ``lib/Support`` to provide is a function, say; ``ExecuteProgramAndWait``, that implements the functionality completely. what; we don't want is wrappers for the operating system calls involved. There must **not** be a one-to-one relationship between operating system; calls and the Support library's interface. Any such interface function will be; suspicious. No Unused Functionality; -----------------------. There must be no functionality specified in the interface of ``lib/Support``; that isn't actually used by LLVM. We're not writing a general purpose operating; system wrapper here, just enough to satisfy LLVM's needs. And, LLVM doesn't; need much. This design goal aims to keep the ``lib/Support`` interface small and; understandable which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems supported for a given class of operating system (e.g. Unix, Win32).

Integrability,"continuation lowering, ``llvm.coro.end`` fully destroys the; coroutine frame. If the second argument is `false`, it also returns from; the coroutine with a null continuation pointer, and the next instruction; will be unreachable. If the second argument is `true`, it falls through; so that the following logic can resume unwinding. In a yield-once; coroutine, reaching a non-unwind ``llvm.coro.end`` without having first; reached a ``llvm.coro.suspend.retcon`` has undefined behavior. The remainder of this section describes the behavior under switched-resume; lowering. This intrinsic is lowered when a coroutine is split into; the start, resume and destroy parts. In the start part, it is a no-op,; in resume and destroy parts, it is replaced with `ret void` instruction and; the rest of the block containing `coro.end` instruction is discarded.; In landing pads it is replaced with an appropriate instruction to unwind to; caller. The handling of coro.end differs depending on whether the target is; using landingpad or WinEH exception model. For landingpad based exception model, it is expected that frontend uses the; `coro.end`_ intrinsic as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %InResumePart = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none); br i1 %InResumePart, label %eh.resume, label %cleanup.cont. cleanup.cont:; ; rest of the cleanup. eh.resume:; %exn = load ptr, ptr %exn.slot, align 8; %sel = load i32, ptr %ehselector.slot, align 4; %lpad.val = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } undef, ptr %exn, 0; %lpad.val29 = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val, i32 %sel, 1; resume { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val29. The `CoroSpit` pass replaces `coro.end` with ``True`` in the resume functions,; thus leading to immediate unwind to the caller, whereas in start function it; is replaced with ``False``, thus allowing to proceed to the rest of the cleanup; code that is only needed during initial invocation of the coroutine.

Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes. However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon. In those; cases, we have to keep track of the errors for those nodes which are; intermediate nodes of a cycle. An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call. If node ``A`` depends on node ``B`` then the path contains an ``A->B``; edge. From the call stack of the import functions, we can read the very same; path. Now imagine the following AST, where the ``->`` represents dependency in terms; of the import (all nodes are declarations). .. code-block:: text. A->B->C->D; `->E. We would like to import A.; The import behaves like a DFS, so we will visit the nodes in this order: ABCDE.; During the visitation we will have the following import paths:. .. code-block:: text. A; AB; ABC; ABCD; ABC; AB; ABE; AB; A. If during the visit of E there is an error then we set an error for E, then as; the call stack shrinks for B, then for A:. .. code-block:: text.

When calling 'clang_analyzer_warnOnDeadSymbol(x)', if value of 'x' is a; symbol, then this symbol is marked by the ExprInspection checker. Then,; during each garbage collection run, the checker sees if the marked symbol is; being collected and issues the 'SYMBOL DEAD' warning if it does.; This way you know where exactly, up to the line of code, the symbol dies. It is unlikely that you call this function after the symbol is already dead,; because the very reference to it as the function argument prevents it from; dying.

Target descriptions; live in ``lib/Target/``. 6. The target-independent JIT components. The LLVM JIT is completely target; independent (it uses the ``TargetJITInfo`` structure to interface for; target-specific issues. The code for the target-independent JIT lives in; ``lib/ExecutionEngine/JIT``. Depending on which part of the code generator you are interested in working on,; different pieces of this will be useful to you. In any case, you should be; familiar with the `target description`_ and `machine code representation`_; classes. If you want to add a backend for a new target, you will need to; `implement the target description`_ classes for your new target and understand; the :doc:`LLVM code representation <LangRef>`. If you are interested in; implementing a new `code generation algorithm`_, it should only depend on the; target-description and machine code representation classes, ensuring that it is; portable. Required components in the code generator; -----------------------------------------. The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the; code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build; target-specific backends. The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used.

We updated TBuffer::Expand to properly shrink the buffer when requested, hence reducing memory usage in some cases. ### I/O New functionalities. We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ## TTree Libraries. ### Improvement of handling of default number of entries. A new const expression value: `TTree::kMaxEntries` has been introduced to; express the largest possible entry number in a `TTree`. This is used in; two main cases:. - as the default value for the requested number of entries a routine should be; applied to; for example this is used for `TTree::Draw` and `TTree::Process`.; Previously the default was only 1 billions entries, causing those routines to; end early in case of very large trees. - as the default value for the number of entries returned by TChain::GetEntriesFast.; The previous value was kBigNumber (set to 1234567890) and internally (but somewhat; inconsistently, see [ROOT-6885]) a larger value was used (named theBigNumber). Now; `TTree::kMaxEntries` is used throughout TChain. `TChain::kBigNumber` is deprecated and its value has been changed to be equal; to `TTree::kMaxEntries`. ### MakeSelector. `TTree::MakeSelector` has been update to generate a code skeleton based on the `TTreeReader` rather than the old style relying on numeric data members replacements for the user objects. The main advantage is the lifting of the problem related to the fact that the old style was using fixed size array to represent variable size collection. `TTree::MakeSelector` takes an option parameter that can be used to specify the branches that will have a data member.; - If option is `""=legacy""`, a pre-ROOT6 selector will be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md:8941,rout,routines,8941,README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,1,['rout'],['routines']

Objective-C now supports a new expression syntax for creating immutable; array and dictionary container objects. Examples; --------. Immutable array expression:. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = @[ @""Hello"", NSApp, [NSNumber numberWithInt:42] ];. This creates an ``NSArray`` with 3 elements. The comma-separated; sub-expressions of an array literal can be any Objective-C object; pointer typed expression. Immutable dictionary expression:. .. code-block:: objc. NSDictionary *dictionary = @{; @""name"" : NSUserName(),; @""date"" : [NSDate date],; @""processInfo"" : [NSProcessInfo processInfo]; };. This creates an ``NSDictionary`` with 3 key/value pairs. Value; sub-expressions of a dictionary literal must be Objective-C object; pointer typed, as in array literals. Key sub-expressions must be of an; Objective-C object pointer type that implements the; ``<NSCopying>`` protocol. Discussion; ----------. Neither keys nor values can have the value ``nil`` in containers. If the; compiler can prove that a key or value is ``nil`` at compile time, then; a warning will be emitted. Otherwise, a runtime error will occur. Using array and dictionary literals is safer than the variadic creation; forms commonly in use today. Array literal expressions expand to calls; to ``+[NSArray arrayWithObjects:count:]``, which validates that all; objects are non-``nil``. The variadic form,; ``+[NSArray arrayWithObjects:]`` uses ``nil`` as an argument list; terminator, which can lead to malformed array objects. Dictionary; literals are similarly created with; ``+[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:forKeys:count:]`` which validates; all objects and keys, unlike; ``+[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:]`` which also uses a; ``nil`` parameter as an argument list terminator.

We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0. The; C-based APIs for Core Foundation objects, on the other hand, have much more; varied transfer semantics. The use of ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` typedefs is not recommended. If it's; absolutely necessary to use this attribute, be very explicit about using the; typedef, and do not assume that it will be preserved by language features like; ``__typeof`` and C++ template argument substitution. .. admonition:: Rationale.

Binary Encoding; ===============. *Instructions* result in emitting a single PC, and *functions* result in; emission of the start of the function and a 32-bit size. This is followed by; the auxiliary constants that followed the respective section name in the; ``MD_pcsections`` metadata. To avoid relocations in the final binary, each PC address stored at ``entry``; is a relative relocation, computed as ``pc - entry``. To decode, a user has to; compute ``entry + *entry``. The size of each entry depends on the code model. With large and medium sized; code models, the entry size matches pointer size. For any smaller code model; the entry size is just 32 bits.

The most generic case of a multidimensional function has similar approach. Some examples will be shown next. It is important to notice, that one dimensional functions can be also implemented through; the interfaces that will be presented here. Nevertheless, the user needs to implement those following the indications of the previous chapter, for algorithm working exclusivly on one-dimensional; functions. For algorithms working on both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional functions they should instead use this interface. * `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`: This interface provides the `double operator() (const double*)` that takes an array of doubles with all the values for the different dimensions. In this case,; the user has to provide the functionality for two different functions: `double DoEval(const double*)` and `unsigned int NDim()`. The first ones evaluates the function given the array that represents; the multiple variables. The second returns the number of dimensions of the function. Example of implementing a basic multi-dimensional function:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim; {; public:; double DoEval(const double* x) const; {; return x[0] + sin(x[1]);; }. unsigned int NDim() const; {; return 2;; }. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim* Clone() const; {; return new MyFunction();; }. };; ```. * `ROOT::Math::IGradientFunctionMultiDim`: This interface offers the same functionality as the base function plus the calculation of the derivative.; It only adds the `double Derivative(double* x, uint ivar)` method for the user ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:37788,interface,interface,37788,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"ctions used across the; codebase. You can find the most common ones in ``STLExtras.h``; (`doxygen <https://llvm.org/doxygen/STLExtras_8h.html>`__). Some of these wrap; well-known C++ standard library functions, while others are unique to LLVM. .. _uf_iteration:. Iterating over ranges; ---------------------. Sometimes you may want to iterate over more than range at a time or know the; index of the index. LLVM provides custom utility functions to make that easier,; without having to manually manage all iterators and/or indices:. .. _uf_zip:. The ``zip``\ * functions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``zip``\ * functions allow for iterating over elements from two or more ranges; at the same time. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. SmallVector<size_t> Counts = ...;; char Letters[26] = ...;; for (auto [Letter, Count] : zip_equal(Letters, Counts)); errs() << Letter << "": "" << Count << ""\n"";. Note that the elements are provided through a 'reference wrapper' proxy type; (tuple of references), which combined with the structured bindings declaration; makes ``Letter`` and ``Count`` references to range elements. Any modification; to these references will affect the elements of ``Letters`` or ``Counts``. The ``zip``\ * functions support temporary ranges, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Letter, Count] : zip(SmallVector<char>{'a', 'b', 'c'}, Counts)); errs() << Letter << "": "" << Count << ""\n"";. The difference between the functions in the ``zip`` family is how they behave; when the supplied ranges have different lengths:. * ``zip_equal`` -- requires all input ranges have the same length.; * ``zip`` -- iteration stops when the end of the shortest range is reached.; * ``zip_first`` -- requires the first range is the shortest one.; * ``zip_longest`` -- iteration continues until the end of the longest range is; reached. The non-existent elements of shorter ranges are replaced with; ``std::nullopt``. The length requirements are checked with ``assert``\ s.

Prior to the existence of the Legalize passes, we required that every target; `selector`_ supported and handled every operator and type even if they are not; natively supported. The introduction of the Legalize phases allows all of the; canonicalization patterns to be shared across targets, and makes it very easy to; optimize the canonicalized code because it is still in the form of a DAG. .. _optimizations:; .. _Optimize SelectionDAG:; .. _selector:. SelectionDAG Optimization Phase: the DAG Combiner; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SelectionDAG optimization phase is run multiple times for code generation,; immediately after the DAG is built and once after each legalization. The first; run of the pass allows the initial code to be cleaned up (e.g. performing; optimizations that depend on knowing that the operators have restricted type; inputs). Subsequent runs of the pass clean up the messy code generated by the; Legalize passes, which allows Legalize to be very simple (it can focus on making; code legal instead of focusing on generating *good* and legal code). One important class of optimizations performed is optimizing inserted sign and; zero extension instructions.

Clang option ``-fsanitize-memory-track-origins=1`` enables a slightly; faster mode when MemorySanitizer collects only allocation points but; not intermediate stores. Use-after-destruction detection; ===============================. MemorySanitizer includes use-after-destruction detection. After invocation of; the destructor, the object will be considered no longer readable, and using; underlying memory will lead to error reports in runtime. Refer to the standard; for `lifetime <https://eel.is/c++draft/basic.life#1>`_ definition. This feature can be disabled with either:. #. Pass addition Clang option ``-fno-sanitize-memory-use-after-dtor`` during; compilation.; #. Set environment variable `MSAN_OPTIONS=poison_in_dtor=0` before running; the program. Handling external code; ======================. MemorySanitizer requires that all program code is instrumented. This; also includes any libraries that the program depends on, even libc.; Failing to achieve this may result in false reports.; For the same reason you may need to replace all inline assembly code that writes to memory; with a pure C/C++ code. Full MemorySanitizer instrumentation is very difficult to achieve. To; make it easier, MemorySanitizer runtime library includes 70+; interceptors for the most common libc functions. They make it possible; to run MemorySanitizer-instrumented programs linked with; uninstrumented libc. For example, the authors were able to bootstrap; MemorySanitizer-instrumented Clang compiler by linking it with; self-built instrumented libc++ (as a replacement for libstdc++). Supported Platforms; ===================. MemorySanitizer is supported on the following OS:. * Linux; * NetBSD; * FreeBSD.

Integrability,"cts could provide this service but there is a snag:; as there is only one collection object per collection there would only; be one cursor. Instead, to permit the use of as many cursors as; required, they are made separate classes called iterator. For each; collection class there is an associated iterator class that knows how to; sequentially retrieve each member in turn. The relationship between a; collection and its iterator is very close and may require that the; iterator has full access to the collection (i.e. it is a friend class).; In general iterator will be used via the **`TIter`** wrapper class. For; example:. - **`TList`** **`TListIter`**. - **`TMap`** **`TMapIter`**. ## Foundation Classes. All collections are based on the fundamental classes: **`TCollection`**; and **`TIterator`**. They are so generic that it is not possible to; create objects from them; they are only used as base classes for other; classes (i.e. they are abstract base classes). The **`TCollection`** class provides the basic protocol (i.e. the; minimum set of member functions) that all collection classes have to; implement. These include:. - `Add` `Adds another object to the collection.`. - `GetSize` `Returns the number of objects in the collection.`. - `Clear`; `Clears out the collection, but does not delete the removed objects.`. - `Delete`; `Clears out the collection and deletes the removed objects. This should only `; `be used if the collection owns its objects (which are not normally the case).`. - `FindObject` `Finds an object given either its name or address.`. - `MakeIterator` `Returns an iterator associated with the collection.`. - `Remove` `Removes an object from the collection.`. The code example below shows a class containing three lists, where the; `fTracks` list is the owning collection and the other two lists are used; to store a sub-set of the track objects. In the destructor of the class,; the method `Delete` is called for the owning collection to delete; correctly its en",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:6576,protocol,protocol,6576,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

ClassDefInline can still not be used for class template instance using Double32_t or Float16_t as a template parameter or for class or class template that do not have a public default constructor.; - ROOT's backport of `std::string_view` has been updated to follow what's available in C++17, notably its `to_string` member function has been removed. ### Thread safety. Resolved the race conditions inherent to the use of the RecursiveRemove mechanism. - Introduced ```ROOT::TReentrantRWLock```, an implementation of a reentrant read-write lock with a configurable internal mutex/lock and a condition variable to synchronize readers and writers when necessary. The implementation allows a single reader to take the write lock without releasing the reader lock. It also allows the writer to take a read lock. In other word, the lock is re-entrant for both reading and writing. The implementation tries to make faster the scenario when readers come and go but there is no writer. In that case, readers will not pay the price of taking the internal lock.; Moreover, this RW lock tries to be fair with writers, giving them the possibility to claim the lock and wait for only the remaining readers, thus preventing starvation. - Switched the ROOT global to be a ```ROOT::TReentrantRWLock``` and renamed it ROOT::gCoreMutex. The old name ```gROOTMutex``` and ```gInterpreterMutex``` are deprecated and may be removed in future releases.; - Added ```TReadLockGuard```,```TWriteLockGuard```, ```R__READ_LOCKGUARD``` and```R__WRITE_LOCKGUARD``` to take advantage of",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md:4544,synchroniz,synchronize,4544,README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronize']

Implementing the ABI list; -------------------------. The `ABI list <DataFlowSanitizer.html#abi-list>`_ provides a list of functions; which conform to the native ABI, each of which is callable from an instrumented; program. This is implemented by replacing each reference to a native ABI; function with a reference to a function which uses the instrumented ABI.; Such functions are automatically-generated wrappers for the native functions.; For example, given the ABI list example provided in the user manual, the; following wrappers will be generated under the args ABI:. .. code-block:: llvm. define linkonce_odr { i8*, i16 } @""dfsw$malloc""(i64 %0, i16 %1) {; entry:; %2 = call i8* @malloc(i64 %0); %3 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } undef, i8* %2, 0; %4 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } %3, i16 0, 1; ret { i8*, i16 } %4; }. define linkonce_odr { i32, i16 } @""dfsw$tolower""(i32 %0, i16 %1) {; entry:; %2 = call i32 @tolower(i32 %0); %3 = insertvalue { i32, i16 } undef, i32 %2, 0; %4 = insertvalue { i32, i16 } %3, i16 %1, 1; ret { i32, i16 } %4; }. define linkonce_odr { i8*, i16 } @""dfsw$memcpy""(i8* %0, i8* %1, i64 %2, i16 %3, i16 %4, i16 %5) {; entry:; %labelreturn = alloca i16; %6 = call i8* @__dfsw_memcpy(i8* %0, i8* %1, i64 %2, i16 %3, i16 %4, i16 %5, i16* %labelreturn); %7 = load i16* %labelreturn; %8 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } undef, i8* %6, 0; %9 = insertvalue { i8*, i16 } %8, i16 %7, 1; ret { i8*, i16 } %9; }.

When using Geant3, the common block is filled by Geant3 routines at each; step and only the `TTree::Fill` method needs to be called. In this; example we emulate the Geant3 step routine with the `helixStep`; function. We also emulate the filling of the particle values.

On the receiving side, the; `Streamers` are used to read the object from the message sent via the; socket. For network communication, we have a specialized **`TBuffer`**,; a descendant of **`TBuffer`** called **`TMessage`**. In the following; example, we create a **`TMessage`** with the intention to store an; object, hence the constant `kMESS_OBJECT` in the constructor. We create; and fill the histogram and write it into the message. Then we call; **`TSocket`**`::Send` to send the message with the histogram. ``` {.cpp}; ...; // create an object to be sent; TH1F *hpx = new TH1F(""hpx"",""px distribution"",100,-4,4);; hpx->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);. // create a TMessage to send the object; TMessage message(kMESS_OBJECT);. // write the histogram into the message buffer; message.WriteObject(hpx);. // send the message; socket->Send(message);; ...; ```. On the receiving end (in our case the server side), we write a while; loop to wait and receive a message with a histogram. Once we have a; message, we call `TMessage::ReadObject`, which returns a pointer to; **`TObject`**. We have to cast it to a **`TH1`** pointer, and now we; have a histogram. At the end of the loop, the message is deleted, and; another one is created at the beginning. ``` {.cpp}; while (1) {; TMessage *message;; socket->Recv(message);; TH1 *h = (TH1*)message->ReadObject(message->GetClass());; delete message;; }; ```. ## Closing the Connection. Once we are done sending objects, we close the connection by closing the; sockets at both ends. ``` {.cpp}; Socket->Close();; ```.

All Blocks are constructed to be Objective-C objects regardless of; whether the Objective-C runtime is operational in the program or; not. Blocks using automatic (stack) memory are objects and may be; messaged, although they may not be assigned into ``__weak`` locations; if garbage collection is enabled. Within a Block literal expression within a method definition; references to instance variables are also imported into the lexical; scope of the compound statement. These variables are implicitly; qualified as references from self, and so self is imported as a const; copy. The net effect is that instance variables can be mutated. The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (or form strong references if running under garbage collection).; Object variables of ``__block`` storage type are assumed to hold; normal pointers with no provision for retain and release messages. Foundation defines (and supplies) ``-copy`` and ``-release`` methods for; Blocks. In the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages, we allow the; ``__weak`` specifier for ``__block`` variables of object type. If; garbage collection is not enabled, this qualifier causes these; variables to be kept without retain messages being sent. This; knowingly leads to dangling pointers if the Block (or a copy) outlives; the lifetime of this object. In garbage collected environments, the ``__weak`` variable is set to; nil when the object it references is collected, as long as the; ``__block`` variable resides in the heap (either by default or via; ``Block_copy()``). The initial Apple implementation does in fact; start ``__block`` variables on the stack and migrate them to the heap; only as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation.

The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; As a rule of thumb, if about 10% of classes are used, it takes several; hundreds of bound classes before the cppyy-approach is beneficial.; In High Energy Physics, from which it originated, cppyy is regularly used in; software stacks of many thousands of classes, where th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:8622,depend,dependent,8622,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Advantages:; ^^^^^^^^^^^; - Builder allows graph construction code to be reused for DDG and PDG.; - Builder allows us to create DDG and PDG as separate graphs.; - DDG nodes and edges are completely disjoint from PDG nodes and edges allowing them to change easily and independently. Disadvantages:; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Builder may be perceived as over-engineering at first.; - There are some similarities between DDG nodes and edges compared to PDG nodes and edges, but there is little reuse of the class definitions. - This is tolerable given that the node and edge types are fairly simple and there is little code reuse opportunity anyway. .. _implementation-details:. Implementation Details; ======================. The current implementation of DDG differs slightly from the dependence; graph described in [1]_ in the following ways:. 1. The graph nodes in the paper represent three main program components, namely *assignment statements*, *for loop headers* and *while loop headers*. In this implementation, DDG nodes naturally represent LLVM IR instructions. An assignment statement in this implementation typically involves a node representing the ``store`` instruction along with a number of individual nodes computing the right-hand-side of the assignment that connect to the ``store`` node via a def-use edge. The loop header instructions are not represented as special nodes in this implementation because they have limited uses and can be easily identified, for example, through ``LoopAnalysis``.; 2. The paper describes five types of dependency edges between nodes namely *loop dependency*, *flow-*, *anti-*, *output-*, and *input-* dependencies. In this implementation *memory* edges represent the *flow-*, *anti-*, *output-*, and *input-* dependencies.

The version number; is written to the file in the `Streamer` by the call; `TBuffer::WriteVersion`. You, as the designer of the class, do not need; to do any manual modification in the `Streamer`. ROOT schema evolution; mechanism is automatic and handled by the `StreamerInfo`. ### Manual Data Model Evolution Capabilities. The automatic data model schema evolution implemented in ROOT makes it possible; to read back the serialized data object in the situation when the definition of; the classes those objects represent changed slightly (some of the data members were; removed or some new ones added). It is also possible to manually specify the rules; for more sophisticated data transformations done while reading to load the serialized; objects into data structures that changed quite significantly. ROOT provides two interface enabling users to specify the conversion rules. The; first way is to define a rule in the dictionary file and the second way is to insert; it to the TClass object using the C++ API. There are two types of conversion rules. The first of them, the normal rules, are; the ones that should be used in the most of the cases. They provide a buffered input; data and an address of the in-memory target object and allow user to specify the; conversion function mapping the data being read to the output format. The second type; of the rules, the raw rules, also provide the pointer to the target object but the; input is a raw TBuffer object containing the input data member declared as an input; to the rule. This type of a rule is provided mainly to handle the file format changes; that couldn't have been handled otherwise and in general should not be used unless there; is no other option. #### The dictionaries.

The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used. This design has two important implications. The first is that LLVM can support; completely non-traditional code generation targets. For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:3549,interface,interfaces,3549,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Global Value Operands; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The global value machine operands reference the global values from the; :ref:`embedded LLVM IR module <embedded-module>`.; The example below shows an instance of the X86 ``MOV64rm`` instruction that has; a global value operand named ``G``:. .. code-block:: text. $rax = MOV64rm $rip, 1, _, @G, _. The named global values are represented using an identifier with the '@' prefix.; If the identifier doesn't match the regular expression; `[-a-zA-Z$._][-a-zA-Z$._0-9]*`, then this identifier must be quoted. The unnamed global values are represented using an unsigned numeric value with; the '@' prefix, like in the following examples: ``@0``, ``@989``. Target-dependent Index Operands; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A target index operand is a target-specific index and an offset. The; target-specific index is printed using target-specific names and a positive or; negative offset. For example, the ``amdgpu-constdata-start`` is associated with the index ``0``; in the AMDGPU backend. So if we have a target index operand with the index 0; and the offset 8:. .. code-block:: text. $sgpr2 = S_ADD_U32 _, target-index(amdgpu-constdata-start) + 8, implicit-def _, implicit-def _. Jump-table Index Operands; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A jump-table index operand with the index 0 is printed as following:. .. code-block:: text. tBR_JTr killed $r0, %jump-table.0. A machine jump-table entry contains a list of ``MachineBasicBlocks``. When serializing all the function's jump-table entries, the following format is used:. .. code-block:: text. jumpTable:; kind: <kind>; entries:; - id: <index>; blocks: [ <bbreference>, <bbreference>, ... ]. where ``<kind>`` is describing how the jump ta",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:18672,depend,dependent,18672,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['depend'],['dependent']

The entry intrinsic behaves like in the previous example: assuming that; ``@example_kernel`` is an OpenCL kernel (as hinted at by the ""subgroup""; terminology), we expect it to communicate among all threads within the; ""subgroup"". This typically maps to a SIMD vector on GPU hardware. The calls to ``@subgroupAdd`` use the token produced by the entry intrinsic,; but they also have an additional control dependency. According to the rules; defined in this document, they only communicate among the subset of threads; that actually end up executing the respective (static) call site. Hoisting them would remove the control dependency and cause them to communicate; among the full set of threads that the entry intrinsic communicated with.; Again, hoisting is allowed if it can be proven that ``%cc`` is always uniform; among the relevant set of threads: in that case, the ``@subgroupAdd`` already; communicates among the full set of threads in the original program.

The requirement to annotate all pointers with explicit bounds information could; present a significant adoption burden. To tackle this issue, the model; incorporates the concept of a ""wide pointer"" (a.k.a. fat pointer) – a larger; pointer that carries bounds information alongside the pointer value. Utilizing; wide pointers can potentially reduce the adoption burden, as it contains bounds; information internally and eliminates the need for explicit bounds annotations.; However, wide pointers differ from standard C pointers in their data layout,; which may result in incompatibilities with the application binary interface; (ABI). Breaking the ABI complicates interoperability with external code that has; not adopted the same programming model. ``-fbounds-safety`` harmonizes the wide pointer and the bounds annotation; approaches to reduce the adoption burden while maintaining the ABI. In this; model, local variables of pointer type are implicitly treated as wide pointers,; allowing them to carry bounds information without requiring explicit bounds; annotations. Please note that this approach doesn't apply to function parameters; which are considered ABI-visible. As local variables are typically hidden from; the ABI, this approach has a marginal impact on it.

This calculation is in part; delegated to `TEfficiency`. A single option can be given as a parameter, that is; used to determine which procedure is chosen. The remaining option string is then; passed through to the calculation, if applicable. Several examples illustrate how to use this class. See:; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/ratioplot?.C`. * New option ""I"" allowing to draw TGraph with invisible axis (used by `TRatioPlot`);. ## New histogram drawing options. ### COL2; COL2 is a new rendering technique providing potential performance improvements; compared to the standard COL option. The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content.

Variable locations in Instruction Selection and MIR; ---------------------------------------------------. Instruction selection creates a MIR function from an IR function, and just as; it transforms ``intermediate`` instructions into machine instructions, so must; ``intermediate`` variable locations become machine variable locations.; Within IR, variable locations are always identified by a Value, but in MIR; there can be different types of variable locations. In addition, some IR; locations become unavailable, for example if the operation of multiple IR; instructions are combined into one machine instruction (such as; multiply-and-accumulate) then intermediate Values are lost. To track variable; locations through instruction selection, they are first separated into; locations that do not depend on code generation (constants, stack locations,; allocated virtual registers) and those that do. For those that do, debug; metadata is attached to SDNodes in SelectionDAGs. After instruction selection; has occurred and a MIR function is created, if the SDNode associated with debug; metadata is allocated a virtual register, that virtual register is used as the; variable location. If the SDNode is folded into a machine instruction or; otherwise transformed into a non-register, the variable location becomes; unavailable. Locations that are unavailable are treated as if they have been optimized out:; in IR the location would be assigned ``undef`` by a debug intrinsic, and in MIR; the equivalent location is used. After MIR locations are assigned to each variable, machine pseudo-instructions; corresponding to each ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic are inserted. There are two; forms of this type of instruction.

The API with a MnUserParameterState should not be used after minimization, because in that case the latest state information resulting from the minimum (gradient values and step sizes) is lost. Add support in MnMigrad and MnMinimize for user provided analytical gradient of the FCN function. One needs to pass an instance of a function implementing the ROOT::Minuit2::FcnGradientBase interface. Use now std::string for storing parameter names. This removes the un-necessary limitation on the length of parameter name (10 characters) existing before. The method Name() of MinuitParameter (and of MnUserParameterState and MnUserParameters) still returns a const char * (for backward compatibility). A new method, GetName() has been added to return a std::string. The Minuit2Minimizer class has been improved by having an option to always run Hesse if it was not done before during the minimization.

The; command-line interface of the frontend is considered to be an implementation; detail, intentionally has no external documentation, and is subject to change; without notice. Language frontends for other languages; --------------------------------------. Clang can be provided with inputs written in non-C-family languages. In such; cases, an external tool will be used to compile the input. The; currently-supported languages are:. * Ada (``-x ada``, ``.ad[bs]``); * Fortran (``-x f95``, ``.f``, ``.f9[05]``, ``.for``, ``.fpp``, case-insensitive); * Java (``-x java``). In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags. The set of implicitly-linked libraries depend on the language mode.

A brief step-by-step procedure to install CernVM-FS is hereby described. - Download and install the latest stable version from; [here](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem): pick one which is; appropriate to your operating system. You need the `cvmfs` package,; you *don't* need the `cvmfs-devel` or `cvmfs-server` ones. - As root user, run:. # cvmfs_config setup. - Start the `autofs` service: how to to this depends on your operating; system. On Ubuntu using Upstart:. # restart autofs. On RHEL-based or older Ubuntus:. # service autofs restart. - Prepare a `/etc/cvmfs/default.local` file (create it if it does not; exists) with the following configuration bits:. ``` {.bash}; CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy-server.domain.ch:3128,DIRECT; CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=your-experiment.cern.ch,sft.cern.ch; CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=50000; ```. You need to properly specify your closest HTTP caching proxy:; separate many of them via commas. The last fallback value, `DIRECT`,; tells cvmfs to connect directly without using any proxy at all. Among the list of repositories (comma-separated), always specify; `sft.cern.ch` and the one containing the software to your experiment; (e.g., `cms.cern.ch`). The quota limit is, in Megabytes, the amount of local disk space to; use as cache. - Check the configuration and repositories with:. # cvmfs_config chksetup; OK; # cvmfs_config probe; Probing /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch...

(It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`. One may `#define R__SUGGEST_NEW_INTERFACE` to switch on; deprecation warnings for the functions in question.; Similarly, the bin content can now be set using an index, making prior loading of a certain coordinate unnecessary:; ```; for (int i=0 ; i<hist->numEntries() ; i++) {; - hist->get(i) ;; - hist->set(hist->weight() / sum);; + hist->set(i, hist->weight(i) / sum, 0.);; }; ```; - More const correctness. `calcTreeIndex()` doesn't rely on side effects, any more. Instead of overwriting the internal; coordinates with new values:; ```; // In a RooDataHist subclass:; _vars = externalCoordinates;; auto index = calcTreeIndex();. // Or from the outside:; auto index = dataHist.getIndex(externalCoordinates); // Side effect: Active bin is now `index`.; ```; coordinates are now passed into calcTreeIndex without side effects:; ```",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md:21685,interface,interface,21685,README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

The ``AttributeList`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind of; object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as a whole,; the return type, or the function's parameters. A function's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::FunctionIndex``; the return type's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::ReturnIndex``; and the function's parameters' attributes; are at indices 1, ..., n (where 'n' is the number of parameters). Most methods; on the ``AttributeList`` class take an index parameter. An ``AttributeList`` is also a uniqued and immutable object. You create an; ``AttributeList`` through the ``AttributeList::get`` methods. You can add and; remove attributes, which result in the creation of a new ``AttributeList``. An ``AttributeList`` object is designed to be passed around by value. Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the ``AttributeList`` ""introspection""; methods (e.g. ``Raw``, ``getRawPointer``, etc.). These methods break; encapsulation, and may be removed in a future release. ``AttrBuilder``; ===============. Lastly, we have a ""builder"" class to help create the ``AttributeList`` object; without having to create several different intermediate uniqued; ``AttributeList`` objects. The ``AttrBuilder`` class allows you to add and; remove attributes at will. The attributes won't be uniqued until you call the; appropriate ``AttributeList::get`` method. An ``AttrBuilder`` object is *not* designed to be passed around by value. It; should be passed by reference. Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the ``AttrBuilder::addRawValue()``; method or the ``AttrBuilder(uint64_t Val)`` constructor. These are for; backwards compatibility and may be removed in a future release. And that's basically it!

Objective-C Features; ====================. Related result types; --------------------. According to Cocoa conventions, Objective-C methods with certain names; (""``init``"", ""``alloc``"", etc.) always return objects that are an instance of; the receiving class's type. Such methods are said to have a ""related result; type"", meaning that a message send to one of these methods will have the same; static type as an instance of the receiver class. For example, given the; following classes:. .. code-block:: objc. @interface NSObject; + (id)alloc;; - (id)init;; @end. @interface NSArray : NSObject; @end. and this common initialization pattern. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] init];. the type of the expression ``[NSArray alloc]`` is ``NSArray*`` because; ``alloc`` implicitly has a related result type. Similarly, the type of the; expression ``[[NSArray alloc] init]`` is ``NSArray*``, since ``init`` has a; related result type and its receiver is known to have the type ``NSArray *``.; If neither ``alloc`` nor ``init`` had a related result type, the expressions; would have had type ``id``, as declared in the method signature. A method with a related result type can be declared by using the type; ``instancetype`` as its result type. ``instancetype`` is a contextual keyword; that is only permitted in the result type of an Objective-C method, e.g. .. code-block:: objc. @interface A; + (instancetype)constructAnA;; @end.

This is used to ensure that landing pad entries in the LSDA are; generated in matching order. Asm Table Formats; =================. There are two tables that are used by the exception handling runtime to; determine which actions should be taken when an exception is thrown. Exception Handling Frame; ------------------------. An exception handling frame ``eh_frame`` is very similar to the unwind frame; used by DWARF debug info. The frame contains all the information necessary to; tear down the current frame and restore the state of the prior frame. There is; an exception handling frame for each function in a compile unit, plus a common; exception handling frame that defines information common to all functions in the; unit. The format of this call frame information (CFI) is often platform-dependent,; however. ARM, for example, defines their own format. Apple has their own compact; unwind info format. On Windows, another format is used for all architectures; since 32-bit x86. LLVM will emit whatever information is required by the; target. Exception Tables; ----------------. An exception table contains information about what actions to take when an; exception is thrown in a particular part of a function's code. This is typically; referred to as the language-specific data area (LSDA). The format of the LSDA; table is specific to the personality function, but the majority of personalities; out there use a variation of the tables consumed by ``__gxx_personality_v0``.; There is one exception table per function, except leaf functions and functions; that have calls only to non-throwing functions.

Integrability,"dent server threads. Fortunately, ``LLVMContext``; exists to enable just this kind of scenario!. Conceptually, ``LLVMContext`` provides isolation. Every LLVM entity; (``Module``\ s, ``Value``\ s, ``Type``\ s, ``Constant``\ s, etc.) in LLVM's; in-memory IR belongs to an ``LLVMContext``. Entities in different contexts; *cannot* interact with each other: ``Module``\ s in different contexts cannot be; linked together, ``Function``\ s cannot be added to ``Module``\ s in different; contexts, etc. What this means is that is safe to compile on multiple; threads simultaneously, as long as no two threads operate on entities within the; same context. In practice, very few places in the API require the explicit specification of a; ``LLVMContext``, other than the ``Type`` creation/lookup APIs. Because every; ``Type`` carries a reference to its owning context, most other entities can; determine what context they belong to by looking at their own ``Type``. If you; are adding new entities to LLVM IR, please try to maintain this interface; design. .. _jitthreading:. Threads and the JIT; -------------------. LLVM's ""eager"" JIT compiler is safe to use in threaded programs. Multiple; threads can call ``ExecutionEngine::getPointerToFunction()`` or; ``ExecutionEngine::runFunction()`` concurrently, and multiple threads can run; code output by the JIT concurrently. The user must still ensure that only one; thread accesses IR in a given ``LLVMContext`` while another thread might be; modifying it. One way to do that is to always hold the JIT lock while accessing; IR outside the JIT (the JIT *modifies* the IR by adding ``CallbackVH``\ s).; Another way is to only call ``getPointerToFunction()`` from the; ``LLVMContext``'s thread. When the JIT is configured to compile lazily (using; ``ExecutionEngine::DisableLazyCompilation(false)``), there is currently a `race; condition <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5184>`_ in updating call sites; after a function is lazily-jitted.

Each of these is referenced by a numeric ""file ID"", which is a; unique number (allocated starting at 1) stored in the source location. Clang; serializes the information for each kind of file ID, along with an index that; maps file IDs to the position within the AST file where the information about; that file ID is stored.

Integrability,"design between the LTO optimizer and the linker. Design Philosophy; =================. The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document.

Intervals from; the sampling method can be asymmetric, and may perform better in the; presence of strong correlations, but may take (much) longer to; calculate. The sampling method also assumes that the uncertainty on the; parameters can modeled by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.

It is also possible to visualize partial errors (from a subset of the parameters),; as shown above. Binned dataset generation.

Integrability,"developers who don't build our project from source. Those; modules are the fundamental pieces needed to build LLVM-based projects with; CMake. We also rely on modules as a way of organizing the build system's; functionality for maintainability and re-use within LLVM projects. Argument Handling; -----------------. When defining a CMake command handling arguments is very useful. The examples; in this section will all use the CMake ``function`` block, but this all applies; to the ``macro`` block as well. CMake commands can have named arguments that are required at every call site. In; addition, all commands will implicitly accept a variable number of extra; arguments (In C parlance, all commands are varargs functions). When a command is; invoked with extra arguments (beyond the named ones) CMake will store the full; list of arguments (both named and unnamed) in a list named ``ARGV``, and the; sublist of unnamed arguments in ``ARGN``. Below is a trivial example of; providing a wrapper function for CMake's built in function ``add_dependencies``. .. code-block:: cmake. function(add_deps target); add_dependencies(${target} ${ARGN}); endfunction(). This example defines a new macro named ``add_deps`` which takes a required first; argument, and just calls another function passing through the first argument and; all trailing arguments. CMake provides a module ``CMakeParseArguments`` which provides an implementation; of advanced argument parsing. We use this all over LLVM, and it is recommended; for any function that has complex argument-based behaviors or optional; arguments. CMake's official documentation for the module is in the; ``cmake-modules`` manpage, and is also available at the; `cmake-modules online documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/module/CMakeParseArguments.html>`_. .. note::; As of CMake 3.5 the cmake_parse_arguments command has become a native command; and the CMakeParseArguments module is empty and only left around for; compatibility.

Specifies that the given ``Code`` (a string) should be inserted before the; source location ``Loc``. * ``FixItHint::CreateRemoval(Range)``. Specifies that the code in the given source ``Range`` should be removed. * ``FixItHint::CreateReplacement(Range, Code)``. Specifies that the code in the given source ``Range`` should be removed,; and replaced with the given ``Code`` string. .. _DiagnosticConsumer:. The ``DiagnosticConsumer`` Interface; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once code generates a diagnostic with all of the arguments and the rest of the; relevant information, Clang needs to know what to do with it. As previously; mentioned, the diagnostic machinery goes through some filtering to map a; severity onto a diagnostic level, then (assuming the diagnostic is not mapped; to ""``Ignore``"") it invokes an object that implements the ``DiagnosticConsumer``; interface with the information. It is possible to implement this interface in many different ways. For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output.

The offset operations can operate on location storage of any size. For example,; implicit location storage could be any number of bits in size. It is simpler to; define offsets that exceed the size of the location storage as being an; evaluation error, than having to force an implementation to support potentially; infinite precision offsets to allow it to correctly track a series of positive; and negative offsets that may transiently overflow or underflow, but end up in; range. This is simple for the arithmetic operations as they are defined in terms; of two's complement arithmetic on a base type of a fixed size. Therefore, the; offset operation define that integer overflow is ill-formed. This is in contrast; to the ``DW_OP_plus``, ``DW_OP_plus_uconst``, and ``DW_OP_minus`` arithmetic; operations which define that it causes wrap-around. Having the offset operations allows ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` to push a; location description that may be in a register, or be an implicit value. The; DWARF expression of ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type`` can use the offset operations; without regard to what kind of location description was pushed. Since; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-allow-location-description-on-the-dwarf-evaluation-stack` has; generalized location storage to be bit indexable, ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset``; generalizes DWARF to work with bit fields. This is generally not possible in; DWARF Version 5. The ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations only allow literal indices. A way to use a; computed offset of an arbitrary location description (such as a vector register); is required. The offset operations provide this ability since they can be used; to compute a location description on the stack.

To enforce this language version, we check the most; popular host toolchains for specific minimum versions in our build systems:. * Clang 5.0; * Apple Clang 10.0; * GCC 7.4; * Visual Studio 2019 16.7. Anything older than these toolchains *may* work, but will require forcing the; build system with a special option and is not really a supported host platform.; Also note that older versions of these compilers have often crashed or; miscompiled LLVM. For less widely used host toolchains such as ICC or xlC, be aware that a very; recent version may be required to support all of the C++ features used in LLVM. We track certain versions of software that are *known* to fail when used as; part of the host toolchain. These even include linkers at times. **GNU ld 2.16.X**. Some 2.16.X versions of the ld linker will produce very long; warning messages complaining that some ""``.gnu.linkonce.t.*``"" symbol was; defined in a discarded section. You can safely ignore these messages as they are; erroneous and the linkage is correct. These messages disappear using ld 2.17. **GNU binutils 2.17**: Binutils 2.17 contains `a bug; <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3111>`__ which causes huge link; times (minutes instead of seconds) when building LLVM.

The method above computes the normal to the next crossed surface in; forward or backward direction (i.e. the current one), assuming the state; corresponding to a current arbitrary point is initialized. An example of; usage of normal computation is ray tracing. The two most important features of the geometrical modeller concerning; tracking are scalability and performance as function of the total number; of physical nodes. The first refers to the possibility to make use of; the available memory resources and at the same time be able to resolve; any geometrical query, while the second defines the capability of the; modeller to respond quickly even for huge geometries. These parameters; can become critical when simulating big experiments like those at LHC. ### Creating and Visualizing Tracks. In case the modeller is interfaced with a tracking engine, one might; consider quite useful being able to store and visualize at least a part; of the tracks in the context of the geometry. The base class; **`TVirtualGeoTrack`** provides this functionality. It currently has one; implementation inside the drawing package (**`TGeoTrack`** class). A; track can be defined like:. ``` {.cpp}; TVirtualGeoTrack(Int_t id,Int_t pdg,TVirtualGeoTrack *parent=0,; TObject *particle=0);; ```. Where: `id` is user-defined id of the track, `pdg` - `pdg` code,; `parent` - a pointer to parent track, `particle` - a pointer to an; arbitrary particle object (may be a **`TParticle`**). A track has a list of daughters that have to be filled using the; following method:. ``` {.cpp}; TVirtualGeoTrack *TVirtualGeoTrack::AddDaughter(Int_t id,Int_t pdg,; TObject *particle=0);; ```.

Usage; =====. To enable ShadowCallStack, just pass the ``-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack`` flag; to both compile and link command lines. On aarch64, you also need to pass; ``-ffixed-x18`` unless your target already reserves ``x18``. On RISC-V, ``x3``; (``gp``) is always reserved. It is, however, important to disable GP relaxation; in the linker. This can be done with the ``--no-relax-gp`` flag in GNU ld. Low-level API; -------------. ``__has_feature(shadow_call_stack)``; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. In some cases one may need to execute different code depending on whether; ShadowCallStack is enabled. The macro ``__has_feature(shadow_call_stack)`` can; be used for this purpose. .. code-block:: c. #if defined(__has_feature); # if __has_feature(shadow_call_stack); // code that builds only under ShadowCallStack; # endif; #endif. ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""shadow-call-stack"")))``; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Use ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""shadow-call-stack"")))`` on a function; declaration to specify that the shadow call stack instrumentation should not be; applied to that function, even if enabled globally. Example; =======. The following example code:. .. code-block:: c++. int foo() {; return bar() + 1;; }. Generates the following aarch64 assembly when compiled with ``-O2``:. .. code-block:: none. stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!; mov x29, sp; bl bar; add w0, w0, #1; ldp x29, x30, [sp], #16; ret.

Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

When an expression reads an; element using an integral index, as in the following example:. .. code-block:: objc. NSUInteger idx = ...;; id value = object[idx];. it is translated into a call to ``objectAtIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. id value = [object objectAtIndexedSubscript:idx];. When an expression writes an element using an integral index:. .. code-block:: objc. object[idx] = newValue;. it is translated to a call to ``setObject:atIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. [object setObject:newValue atIndexedSubscript:idx];. These message sends are then type-checked and performed just like; explicit message sends. The method used for objectAtIndexedSubscript:; must be declared with an argument of integral type and a return value of; some Objective-C object pointer type. The method used for; setObject:atIndexedSubscript: must be declared with its first argument; having some Objective-C pointer type and its second argument having; integral type. The meaning of indexes is left up to the declaring class. The compiler; will coerce the index to the appropriate argument type of the method it; uses for type-checking. For an instance of ``NSArray``, reading an; element using an index outside the range ``[0, array.count)`` will raise; an exception. For an instance of ``NSMutableArray``, assigning to an; element using an index within this range will replace that element, but; assigning to an element using an index outside this range will raise an; exception; no syntax is provided for inserting, appending, or removing; elements for mutable arrays.

As such, it will first parse; the leading primary expression ""a"", then it will see the pairs [+, b]; [+, (c+d)] [\*, e] [\*, f] and [+, g]. Note that because parentheses are; primary expressions, the binary expression parser doesn't need to worry; about nested subexpressions like (c+d) at all.

Integrability,"e Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them.

Each describes one persistent data; member of the class. By default, all data members of a class are; persistent. To exclude a data member (i.e. make it not persistent), add; a ""`!`"" after the comment marks. For example the pointer \*`fPainter` of; a **`TH1`** is not persistent:. ``` {.cpp}; TVirtualHistPainter* fPainter //!pointer to histogram painter; ```. ### The TStreamerElement Class. A **`TStreamerElement`** describes a data member of a simple type,; object, array, pointer, or container. The offset in the; **`TStreamerElement`** is the starting address of the data for that data; member. ``` {.cpp}; BASE TNamed offset= 0 type=67 The basis for a named object; BASE TAttLine offset= 28 type= 0 Line attributes; ```. In this example, the **`TNamed`** data starts at byte 0, and; **`TAttLine`** starts at byte 28. The offset is machine and compiler; dependent and is computed when the `StreamerInfo` is analyzed. The types; are defined in the file `TStreamerInfo.h` and listed here:. ``` {.cpp}; enum EReadWrite {; kBase=0, kChar=1,kShort=2,kInt=3,kLong=4,; kFloat=5, kCounter=6,kCharStar=7, kDouble=8,kUChar=11,; kUShort=12, kUInt=13,kULong=14,kBits=15,kOffsetL=20,; kOffsetP=40, kObject=61,kAny=62,kObjectp=63,kObjectP=64,; kTString=65, kTObject=66,kTNamed=67,kSkip=100,kSkipL=120,; kSkipP=140, kConv=200, kConvL=220,kConvP=240,kStreamer=500,; kStreamLoop=501, kMissing=99999; };; ```. The method `TClass::GetStreamerInfo` analyzes the `StreamerInfo` the; same way it would be analyzed by referring to the class. While analyzing; the `StreamerInfo`, it computes the offsets. The type field is the type; of the **`TStreamerElement`**. It is specific to the `StreamerInfo`; definition. ### Example: TH1 StreamerInfo.

This is a more complicated example than the ones we have seen before, so; spend some time analysing it carefully, you should have understood it; before continuing. Let us go through it in detail:. Lines *7-18* define the necessary functions in `C++` code, split into; three separate functions, as suggested by the problem considered. The; full interference pattern is given by the product of a function; depending on the ratio of the width and distance of the slits, and a; second one depending on the number of slits.

From a purely single-threaded perspective, sinking the `textureSample` into; the if-statement appears legal.

It is possible to implement this interface in many different ways. For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`.

For example, if the location; corresponds to a token, it should contain the set of ``#include``\ s active; when the token was lexed. This allows us to print the ``#include`` stack; for a diagnostic.; #. ``SourceLocation`` must be able to describe macro expansions, capturing both; the ultimate instantiation point and the source of the original character; data. In practice, the ``SourceLocation`` works together with the ``SourceManager``; class to encode two pieces of information about a location: its spelling; location and its expansion location. For most tokens, these will be the; same. However, for a macro expansion (or tokens that came from a ``_Pragma``; directive) these will describe the location of the characters corresponding to; the token and the location where the token was used (i.e., the macro; expansion point or the location of the ``_Pragma`` itself). The Clang front-end inherently depends on the location of a token being tracked; correctly. If it is ever incorrect, the front-end may get confused and die.; The reason for this is that the notion of the ""spelling"" of a ``Token`` in; Clang depends on being able to find the original input characters for the; token. This concept maps directly to the ""spelling location"" for the token. ``SourceRange`` and ``CharSourceRange``; ---------------------------------------. .. mostly taken from https://discourse.llvm.org/t/code-ranges-of-tokens-ast-elements/16893/2. Clang represents most source ranges by [first, last], where ""first"" and ""last""; each point to the beginning of their respective tokens. For example consider; the ``SourceRange`` of the following statement:. .. code-block:: text. x = foo + bar;; ^first ^last. To map from this representation to a character-based representation, the ""last""; location needs to be adjusted to point to (or past) the end of that token with; either ``Lexer::MeasureTokenLength()`` or ``Lexer::getLocForEndO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:24744,depend,depends,24744,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"e default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;; * Incremental adoption -- provide third-party code with an incremental; migration process for their codebases. ## Motivation. An implementation of the modules concepts exists in the LLVM frontend Clang used; as a library by ROOT [[2]]. Clang supports the Modules TS and hosts modules ; research and development work. The implementation encourages incremental, ; bottom-up [[3]] adoption of the modules feature. Modules in Clang are designed; to work for C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++ and Swift. Users can enable the; modules feature without modifications in header files. The LLVM compiler allows; users to specify module interfaces in dedicated file, called *module maps files*.; A module map file expresses the mapping between a module file and a collection; of header files. If the compiler finds such file in the include paths it; automatically generates, imports and uses module files. The module map files can; be mounted using the compiler's virtual file system overlay mechanism to; non-writable production library installations. In practice, a non-invasive *modularization* can be done easily by introducing; a module map file. ```cpp; // A.h ; int pow2(int x) {; return x * x;; }; ```; ```cpp; // B.cpp; #include ""A.h"" // clang rewires this to import A.; int main() {; return pow2(42);; }; ```. ```cpp; // A.h module interface, aka module map file; module A {; header ""A.h""; export * // clang exports the contents of A.h as part of module A.; }; ```. A.h defines *pow2*, the module map file instructs clang to create *A.pcm* and; import it in B.cpp. In a number of cases the module map files can be automatically ge",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:2628,interface,interfaces,2628,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Calling Conventions; -------------------. To support target-specific calling conventions, ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` uses; interfaces (such as ``CCIfType`` and ``CCAssignToReg``) that are defined in; ``lib/Target/TargetCallingConv.td``. TableGen can take the target descriptor; file ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` and generate the header file; ``XXXGenCallingConv.inc``, which is typically included in; ``XXXISelLowering.cpp``. You can use the interfaces in; ``TargetCallingConv.td`` to specify:. * The order of parameter allocation. * Where parameters and return values are placed (that is, on the stack or in; registers). * Which registers may be used. * Whether the caller or callee unwinds the stack. The following example demonstrates the use of the ``CCIfType`` and; ``CCAssignToReg`` interfaces. If the ``CCIfType`` predicate is true (that is,; if the current argument is of type ``f32`` or ``f64``), then the action is; performed. In this case, the ``CCAssignToReg`` action assigns the argument; value to the first available register: either ``R0`` or ``R1``. .. code-block:: text. CCIfType<[f32,f64], CCAssignToReg<[R0, R1]>>. ``SparcCallingConv.td`` contains definitions for a target-specific return-value; calling convention (``RetCC_Sparc32``) and a basic 32-bit C calling convention; (``CC_Sparc32``). The definition of ``RetCC_Sparc32`` (shown below) indicates; which registers are used for specified scalar return types. A single-precision; float is returned to register ``F0``, and a double-precision float goes to; register ``D0``. A 32-bit integer is returned in register ``I0`` or ``I1``. .. code-block:: text. def RetCC_Sparc32 : CallingConv<[; CCIfType<[i32], CCAssignToReg<[I0, I1]>>,; CCIfType<[f32], CCAssignToReg<[F0]>>,; CCIfTy",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst:62385,interface,interfaces,62385,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level.

In the original tutorial series the FunctionPassManager was; created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules were optimized before being; added to it. In this Chapter we will make optimization a phase of our JIT; instead. For now this will provide us a motivation to learn more about ORC; layers, but in the long term making optimization part of our JIT will yield an; important benefit: When we begin lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring; compilation of each function until the first time it's run) having; optimization managed by our JIT will allow us to optimize lazily too, rather; than having to do all our optimization up-front. To add optimization support to our JIT we will take the KaleidoscopeJIT from; Chapter 1 and compose an ORC *IRTransformLayer* on top.

The `evaluate()` function includes some bookkeeping steps (commented out in; above example) that are not relevant to AD. The important part is that it; calls a specific function (doFoo() in this example), and returns the results.

Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps.

However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers).

In addition to input and output filenames, we would like the compiler example to; support three boolean flags: ""``-f``"" to force writing binary output to a; terminal, ""``--quiet``"" to enable quiet mode, and ""``-q``"" for backwards; compatibility with some of our users. We can support these by declaring options; of boolean type like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Enable binary output on terminals""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet2(""q"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""), cl::Hidden);.

FAQ; =========================. Q. Why doesn't libFuzzer use any of the LLVM support?; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two reasons. First, we want this library to be used outside of the LLVM without users having to; build the rest of LLVM. This may sound unconvincing for many LLVM folks,; but in practice the need for building the whole LLVM frightens many potential; users -- and we want more users to use this code. Second, there is a subtle technical reason not to rely on the rest of LLVM, or; any other large body of code (maybe not even STL). When coverage instrumentation; is enabled, it will also instrument the LLVM support code which will blow up the; coverage set of the process (since the fuzzer is in-process). In other words, by; using more external dependencies we will slow down the fuzzer while the main; reason for it to exist is extreme speed. Q. Does libFuzzer Support Windows?; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes, libFuzzer now supports Windows. Initial support was added in r341082.; Any build of Clang 9 supports it. You can download a build of Clang for Windows; that has libFuzzer from; `LLVM Snapshot Builds <https://llvm.org/builds/>`_. Using libFuzzer on Windows without ASAN is unsupported. Building fuzzers with the; ``/MD`` (dynamic runtime library) compile option is unsupported. Support for these; may be added in the future. Linking fuzzers with the ``/INCREMENTAL`` link option; (or the ``/DEBUG`` option which implies it) is also unsupported.

Integrability,"e second property, let us look at f2 as an example. In the interleaved layout,; there are two entries for f2: B::f2 and D::f2. The distance between &B::f2; and its address point D::offset-to-top (the entry immediately after &B::rtti) is 5 entry-length, so is the distance between &D::f2 and C::offset-to-top (the entry immediately after &D::rtti). Forward-Edge CFI for Indirect Function Calls; ============================================. Under forward-edge CFI for indirect function calls, each unique function; type has its own bit vector, and at each call site we need to check that the; function pointer is a member of the function type's bit vector. This scheme; works in a similar way to forward-edge CFI for virtual calls, the distinction; being that we need to build bit vectors of function entry points rather than; of virtual tables. Unlike when re-arranging global variables, we cannot re-arrange functions; in a particular order and base our calculations on the layout of the; functions' entry points, as we have no idea how large a particular function; will end up being (the function sizes could even depend on how we arrange; the functions). Instead, we build a jump table, which is a block of code; consisting of one branch instruction for each of the functions in the bit; set that branches to the target function, and redirect any taken function; addresses to the corresponding jump table entry. In this way, the distance; between function entry points is predictable and controllable. In the object; file's symbol table, the symbols for the target functions also refer to the; jump table entries, so that addresses taken outside the module will pass; any verification done inside the module. In more concrete terms, suppose we have three functions ``f``, ``g``,; ``h`` which are all of the same type, and a function foo that returns their; addresses:. .. code-block:: none. f:; mov 0, %eax; ret. g:; mov 1, %eax; ret. h:; mov 2, %eax; ret. foo:; mov f, %eax; mov g, %edx; mov h, %e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrityDesign.rst:16949,depend,depend,16949,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrityDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrityDesign.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"e semantic handling of the attribute. Parsing of the attribute is determined by the various syntactic forms attributes; can take, such as GNU, C++11, and Microsoft style attributes, as well as other; information provided by the table definition of the attribute. Ultimately, the; parsed representation of an attribute object is a ``ParsedAttr`` object.; These parsed attributes chain together as a list of parsed attributes attached; to a declarator or declaration specifier. The parsing of attributes is handled; automatically by Clang, except for attributes spelled as so-called “custom”; keywords. When implementing a custom keyword attribute, the parsing of the; keyword and creation of the ``ParsedAttr`` object must be done manually. Eventually, ``Sema::ProcessDeclAttributeList()`` is called with a ``Decl`` and; a ``ParsedAttr``, at which point the parsed attribute can be transformed; into a semantic attribute. The process by which a parsed attribute is converted; into a semantic attribute depends on the attribute definition and semantic; requirements of the attribute. The end result, however, is that the semantic; attribute object is attached to the ``Decl`` object, and can be obtained by a; call to ``Decl::getAttr<T>()``. Similarly, for statement attributes,; ``Sema::ProcessStmtAttributes()`` is called with a ``Stmt`` a list of; ``ParsedAttr`` objects to be converted into a semantic attribute. The structure of the semantic attribute is also governed by the attribute; definition given in Attr.td. This definition is used to automatically generate; functionality used for the implementation of the attribute, such as a class; derived from ``clang::Attr``, information for the parser to use, automated; semantic checking for some attributes, etc. ``include/clang/Basic/Attr.td``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; The first step to adding a new attribute to Clang is to add its definition to; `include/clang/Basic/Attr.td; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/inclu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:126613,depend,depends,126613,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"e source uses an `RClusterPool` to asynchronously read-ahead data.; When a page of a certain cluster is required, the cluster pool reads pages of _active_ columns.; For instance, if only certain fields are used (e.g., through an imposed model), only the pages of columns connected to those fields are read.; Columns can be dynamically added (e.g. during event iteration, a new field view is created in a reader).; The cluster pool reads ahead a limited number of clusters given by the _cluster bunch size_ option (default = 1).; The read-ahead uses vector reads.; For the file backend, it additionally coalesces close read requests and uses uring reads when available. The page source can be restricted to a certain entry range.; This allows for optimizing the page lists that are being read.; Additionally, it allows for optimizing the cluster pool to not read-ahead beyond the limits. #### Late model extension; Reading an RNTuple with an extended model is transparent -- i.e., no additional interface calls are required.; Internally, columns that were created as part of late model extension will have synthesized zero-initialized column ranges for the clusters that were already written before the model was extended.; In addition, pages made up of 0x00 bytes are synthesized for deferred columns in the clusters that were already (partially) filled before the model was extended.

Integrability,"e the ``#include <iostream>`` to ``import <iostream>;`` automatically. Relationships between Clang modules; -----------------------------------. Header units have pretty similar semantics with Clang modules.; The semantics of both of them are like headers. In fact, we could even ""mimic"" the sytle of header units by Clang modules:. .. code-block:: c++. module ""iostream"" {; export *; header ""/path/to/libstdcxx/iostream""; }. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 -fimplicit-modules -fmodule-map-file=.modulemap main.cpp. It would be simpler if we are using libcxx:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -fimplicit-modules -fimplicit-module-maps. Since there is already one; `module map <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/module.modulemap.in>`_; in the source of libcxx. Then immediately leads to the question: why don't we implement header units through Clang header modules?. The main reason for this is that Clang modules have more semantics like hierarchy or; wrapping multiple headers together as a big module.; However, these things are not part of Standard C++ Header units,; and we want to avoid the impression that these additional semantics get interpreted as Standard C++ behavior. Another reason is that there are proposals to introduce module mappers to the C++ standard; (for example, https://wg21.link/p1184r2).; If we decide to reuse Clang's modulemap, we may get in trouble once we need to introduce another module mapper. So the final answer for why we don't reuse the interface of Clang modules for header units is that; there are some differences between header units and Clang modules and that ignoring those; differences now would likely become a problem in the future.

If, ElseIf, Else; ----------------. .. note::; For the full documentation on the CMake if command go; `here <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/if.html>`_. That resource is; far more complete. In general CMake if blocks work the way you'd expect:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(<condition>); message(""do stuff""); elseif(<condition>); message(""do other stuff""); else(); message(""do other other stuff""); endif(). The single most important thing to know about CMake's if blocks coming from a C; background is that they do not have their own scope. Variables set inside; conditional blocks persist after the ``endif()``. Loops; -----. The most common form of the CMake ``foreach`` block is:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var ...); message(""do stuff""); endforeach(). The variable argument portion of the ``foreach`` block can contain dereferenced; lists, values to iterate, or a mix of both:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var ${my_list}); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var ${my_list} out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds. There is also a more modern CMake foreach syntax. The code below is equivalent; to the code above:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(var IN ITEMS foo bar baz); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # foo; # bar; # baz. set(my_list 1 2 3); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3. foreach(var IN LISTS my_list ITEMS out_of_bounds); message(${var}); endforeach(); # prints:; # 1; # 2; # 3; # out_of_bounds.

Each of these updates is captured in an ""update record"" that is; stored in the chained precompiled header file and will be loaded along with; the original entity. .. _pchinternals-modules:. Modules; -------. Modules generalize the chained precompiled header model yet further, from a; linear chain of precompiled headers to an arbitrary directed acyclic graph; (DAG) of AST files. All of the same techniques used to make chained; precompiled headers work --- ID number, name lookup, update records --- are; shared with modules. However, the DAG nature of modules introduce a number of; additional complications to the model:. Numbering of IDs; The simple, linear numbering scheme used in chained precompiled headers falls; apart with the module DAG, because different modules may end up with; different numbering schemes for entities they imported from common shared; modules. To account for this, each module file provides information about; which modules it depends on and which ID numbers it assigned to the entities; in those modules, as well as which ID numbers it took for its own new; entities. The AST reader then maps these ""local"" ID numbers into a ""global""; ID number space for the current translation unit, providing a 1-1 mapping; between entities (in whatever AST file they inhabit) and global ID numbers.; If that translation unit is then serialized into an AST file, this mapping; will be stored for use when the AST file is imported. Declaration merging; It is possible for a given entity (from the language's perspective) to be; declared multiple times in different places. For example, two different; headers can have the declaration of ``printf`` or could forward-declare; ``struct stat``. If each of those headers is included in a module, and some; third party imports both of those modules, there is a potentially serious; problem: name lookup for ``printf`` or ``struct stat`` will find both; declarations, but the AST nodes are unrelated.

Specifically, v6.30 includes the following changes:. - Support for custom ROOT I/O rules that target transient members of a user-defined class (see PR [#11944](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11944)). If a rule only targets transient members and it was working in TTree, it should work unmodified in RNTuple. - Improved support for user-defined classes that behave as a collection. Specifically, RNTuple now relies on the iterator interface defined in `TVirtualCollectionProxy` (see PR [#12380](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12380) for details).; Note that associative collections are not yet supported. - Support for new field types: `std::bitset<N>`, `std::unique_ptr<T>`, `std::set<T>`, `Double32_t`, scoped and unscoped enums with dictionary. - Full support for late model extension, which allows the RNTuple model to be extended after a `RNTupleWriter` has been created from the initial model (see PR [#12376](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12376)).; New top-level fields can be created at any time during the writing process.; On read-back, zero-initialized values are read for entries before the field was first seen.; The example below illustrates the use of this feature.; ```; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto fieldPt = model->MakeField<float>(""pt"", 42.0);; auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ""myNTuple"", ""out.ntuple"");; ntuple->Fill();. auto modelUpdater = ntuple->CreateModelUpdat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md:6585,interface,interface,6585,README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Rationale: not all memory and resources are managed with reference counts; it; is common for objects to manage private resources in their own, private way.; Typically these resources are completely encapsulated within the object, but; some classes offer their users direct access for efficiency. If ARC is not; aware of methods that return such ""interior"" pointers, its optimizations can; cause the owning object to be reclaimed too soon. This attribute informs ARC; that it must tread lightly. The extension rules are somewhat intentionally vague. The autorelease pool; limit is there to permit a simple implementation to simply retain and; autorelease the receiver. The other limit permits some amount of; optimization. The phrase ""derived from"" is intended to encompass the results; both of pointer transformations, such as casts and arithmetic, and of loading; from such derived pointers; furthermore, it applies whether or not such; derivations are applied directly in the calling code or by other utility code; (for example, the C library routine ``strchr``).

Internal Design and Implementation. A real-world, production quality compiler. Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are; increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source; compilers have. Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and; built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people. While we are still in; the early development stages, we strongly believe that this will become a; reality. A simple and hackable code base. Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base. A large part of this falls out of our decision to; make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible: you have your friendly; if statement, for statement, parenthesis expression, structs, unions, etc, all; represented in a simple and explicit way.; In addition to a simple design, we work to make the source base approachable; by commenting it well, including citations of the language standards where; appropriate, and designing the code for simplicity. Beyond that, clang offers; a set of AST dumpers, printers, and visualizers that make it easy to put code in; a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:11788,depend,depended,11788,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,2,['depend'],['depended']

This is not the case when going the other way since the; track has first to exit the extruding node before checking the mother.; In other words, an extrusion behavior is dependent on the track; parameters, which is a highly undesirable effect. *B)* We will call ""overlaps"" only the regions in space contained by; more than one node inside the same container. The owner of such regions; cannot be determined based on hierarchical considerations; therefore; they will be considered as belonging to the node from which the current; track is coming from. When coming from their container, the ownership is totally; unpredictable. Again, the ownership of overlapping regions highly; depends on the current track parameters. We must say that even the overlaps of type *A)* and *B)* are allowed in case; the corresponding nodes are created using; TGeoVolume::AddNodeOverlap() method. Navigation is performed in such; cases by giving priority to the non-overlapping nodes.

For example, ""bits were not; set right"" will leave the reviewer wondering about which bits, and why they; weren't right, while ""Correctly set overflow bits in TargetInfo"" conveys almost; all there is to the change.

In the rare situation where there are multiple authors, please use the `git; tag 'Co-authored-by:' to list the additional authors; <https://github.blog/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/>`_. * The title should be concise.

TableGen records are often derived from multiple classes and also often; defined through a sequence of multiclasses. Because of this, it can be; difficult for backends to report clear error messages with accurate source; file locations. To make error reporting easier, five error reporting; functions are provided, each with four overloads. * ``PrintWarning`` prints a message tagged as a warning. * ``PrintError`` prints a message tagged as an error. * ``PrintFatalError`` prints a message tagged as an error and then terminates. * ``PrintNote`` prints a note. It is often used after one of the previous; functions to provide more information. * ``PrintFatalNote`` prints a note and then terminates. Each of these five functions is overloaded four times. * ``PrintError(const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message with no source file location. * ``PrintError(ArrayRef<SMLoc> ErrorLoc, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the specified source line,; along with a pointer to the item in error. The array of; source file locations is typically taken from a ``Record`` instance. * ``PrintError(const Record *Rec, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record (see `Record`_). * ``PrintError(const RecordVal *RecVal, const Twine &Msg)``:; Prints the message followed by the source line associated with the; specified record field (see `RecordVal`_).

The fix for this problem is either to pull the copied declarations into a common header that gets included everywhere ``size_t`` is part of the API, or to eliminate the ``#ifndef`` and redefine the ``size_t`` type. The latter works for C++ headers and C11, but will cause an error for non-modules C90/C99, where redefinition of ``typedefs`` is not permitted. **Conflicting definitions**; Different system headers may provide conflicting definitions for various macros, functions, or types. These conflicting definitions don't tend to cause problems in a pre-modules world unless someone happens to include both headers in one translation unit. Since the fix is often simply ""don't do that"", such problems persist. Modules requires that the conflicting definitions be eliminated or that they be placed in separate modules (the former is generally the better answer). **Missing includes**; Headers are often missing ``#include`` directives for headers that they actually depend on. As with the problem of conflicting definitions, this only affects unlucky users who don't happen to include headers in the right order. With modules, the headers of a particular module will be parsed in isolation, so the module may fail to build if there are missing includes. **Headers that vend multiple APIs at different times**; Some systems have headers that contain a number of different kinds of API definitions, only some of which are made available with a given include. For example, the header may vend ``size_t`` only when the macro ``__need_size_t`` is defined before that header is included, and also vend ``wchar_t`` only when the macro ``__need_wchar_t`` is defined. Such headers are often included many times in a single translation unit, and will have no include guards. There is no sane way to map this header to a submodule. One can either eliminate the header (e.g., by splitting it into separate headers, one per actual A",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:54693,depend,depend,54693,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['depend'],['depend']

These are typically intended to be included at unusual; locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use header; guards, and might not include their prerequisites. Name such files with the; .inc extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when possible. In general, a header should be implemented by one or more ``.cpp`` files. Each; of these ``.cpp`` files should include the header that defines their interface; first. This ensures that all of the dependences of the header have been; properly added to the header itself, and are not implicit. System headers; should be included after user headers for a translation unit. Library Layering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A directory of header files (for example ``include/llvm/Foo``) defines a; library (``Foo``). One library (both; its headers and implementation) should only use things from the libraries; listed in its dependencies. Some of this constraint can be enforced by classic Unix linkers (Mac & Windows; linkers, as well as lld, do not enforce this constraint). A Unix linker; searches left to right through the libraries specified on its command line and; never revisits a library. In this way, no circular dependencies between; libraries can exist. This doesn't fully enforce all inter-library dependencies, and importantly; doesn't enforce header file circular dependencies created by inline functions.; A good way to answer the ""is this layered correctly"" would be to consider; whether a Unix linker would succeed at linking the program if all inline; functions were defined out-of-line.

So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so dropping the statements is OK). Types and dependence; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``RecoveryExpr`` is an ``Expr``, so it must have a type. In many cases the true; type can't really be known until the code is corrected (e.g. a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved. Among other things, this means that clang doesn't emit more errors; where a RecoveryExpr is used as a constant (e.g. array size), but also won't try; to evaluate ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:88064,depend,dependence,88064,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['depend'],['dependence']
Integrability,"eate miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"". If this argument is ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes must assume that the; rounding mode is unknown and may change at runtime. No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes.

This section describes the :program:`lit` testing architecture for users interested in; creating a new :program:`lit` testing implementation, or extending an existing one. :program:`lit` proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running; arbitrary tests, and to expose a single convenient interface to these; tests. :program:`lit` itself doesn't know how to run tests, rather this logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded.

In the future, it might make sense to; allow frontends to control this behavior. IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into llvm.memcpy; or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are flagged volatile.; Likewise, the backend should never split or merge target-legal volatile; load/store instructions. Similarly, IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot; change from integer to floating-point or vice versa. .. admonition:: Rationale. Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported; data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C; this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native; hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types.

If you do:. ``` {.cpp}; a.Draw();; ```. `Draw()` from **`TArrow`** is called and the arrow `a` is drawn. ### Data Encapsulation. We have seen previously the keyword ""`public`"". This keyword means; that every name declared public is seen by the outside world. This is; opposed to ""`private`"" that means only the class where the name was; declared private could see this name. For example, suppose we declare; in **`TArrow`** the variable `ArrowHeadSize` private. ``` {.cpp}; private:; int ArrowHeadSize;; ```. Then, only the methods (i.e. member functions) of **`TArrow`** will be; able to access this variable. Nobody else will see it. Even the; classes that we could derive from **`TArrow`** will not see it. On the; other hand, if we declare the method `Draw()` as public, everybody will; be able to see it and use it. You see that the character public or; private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data; member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case; of **`TArrow`**, the base class **`TLine`** is declared as public:. ``` {.cpp}; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; ```. This means that all methods of **`TArrow`** will be able to access all; methods of **`TLine`**, but this will be also true for anybody in the; outside world. Of course, this is true if **`TLine`** accepts the; outside world to see its methods/data members. If something is; declared private in **`TLine`**, nobody will see it, not even; **`TArrow`** members, even if **`TLine`** is declared as a public; base class. What if **`TLine`** is declared ""`private`"" instead of ""`public`"" ?; Well, it will behave as any other name declared private in; **`TArrow`**: only the data members and methods of **`TArrow`** will; be able to access **`TLine`**, its methods and data members, nobody; else.

There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks. [Most](https://lwn.net/Articles/743265/); [discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information. While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable.

JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs.

This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:30978,interface,interface,30978,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

The second use case applies when starting to edit an existing geometry.; Supposing the geometry was loaded into memory, besides the first method; that still applies one can also edit drawn geometry objects. For this,; the menu entry View/Editor of the canvas containing for instance a drawn; volume must be activated. For starting the volume editor one can click; on a volume. The GUI of the **`TGeoManager`** class can be started by; clicking on the top-right `40x40` pixels corner of the pad with a drawn; geometry. This is the main entry point for editing the geometry or creating new; objects. Once the interface is created (using one of the methods; described above), several categories can be accessed via a shutter GUI; widget:. - *General.* This allows changing the name/title of the geometry,; setting the top volume, closing the geometry and saving the geometry; in a file. The file name is formed by `geometry_name.C` or `.root`; depending if the geometry need to be saved as a `C` macro or a; `.root` file.; - *Shapes.* The category provides buttons for creation of all; supported shapes. The new shape name is chosen by the interface, but; can be changed from the shape editor GUI. Existing shapes can be; browsed and edited from the same category.; - *Volumes.* The category allows the creation of a new volume having a; given name, shape and medium. For creating a volume assembly only; the name is relevant. Existing volumes can be browsed or edited from; this category.; - *Materials.* Allows creation of new materials/mixtures or editing; existing ones.; - *Media.* The same for creation/editing of tracking media (materials; having a set of properties related to tracking); - *Matrices.* Allows creation of translations, rotations or combined; transformations.

Integrability,"ecute converged dynamic instances of the operation. By; definition, this changes the set of threads that participate in the; communication of the convergent operation, which will typically change its; result. There are a number of exceptions, though most of them require additional; knowledge. For example, hoisting and sinking across *uniform* conditional branches -- i.e.,; conditional branches where within every possible relevant set of threads, all; threads will always take the same direction -- is generally allowed. See the end; of the :ref:`example of reductions inside control flow; <convergence_example_reductions>` for a brief discussion. Some convergent operations can be hoisted but not sunk, or vice versa. A simple; example is the ``subgroupShuffle(data, id)`` operation. It returns the ``data``; operand of the thread identified by ``id``, where thread IDs are fixed and; assigned to each thread at launch. The result is undefined (or perhaps there is; UB, depending on the language and environment) if thread ``id`` is not in the; communicating set of threads. So hoisting is allowed in the following; pseudo-code example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @example(...) convergent {; %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry(); %data = ...; %id = ...; if (condition) {; %shuffled = call i32 @subgroupShuffle(i32 %data, i32 %id) [ ""convergencectrl""(token %entry) ]; ...; } else {; %shuffled = call i32 @subgroupShuffle(i32 %data, i32 %id) [ ""convergencectrl""(token %entry) ]; ...; }; }. After hoisting the calls to ``@subgroupShuffle``, the communicating set of; threads is the union of the two sets of threads in the original program, so; ``%id`` can only go ""out of range"" after hoisting if it did so in the original; program. However, speculative execution of ``@subgroupShuffle`` in the following program; may be forbidden:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @example(...) convergent {; %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry(); %data = ...; %i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst:56301,depend,depending,56301,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"ecution; of threads. Informational note: Threads that execute converged dynamic instances do not; necessarily do so at the same time. Other Interactions; ==================. A function can be both ``convergent`` and; ``speculatable``, indicating that the function does not have undefined; behavior and has no effects besides calculating its result, but is still; affected by the set of threads executing this function. This typically; prevents speculation of calls to the function unless the constraint imposed; by ``convergent`` is further relaxed by some other means. Controlled Maximal Convergence; ==============================. The :ref:`converged-with relation <convergence-definition>` over dynamic; instances of each controlled convergent operation is completely defined by the; semantics of convergence tokens. But the implementation-defined convergence at a; call to :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor; <llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor>` also depends on the cycle hierarchy; chosen if it occurs inside an irreducible cycle. When the token defined by a convergent operation ``D`` is used at another; convergent operation ``U``, the implementation must ensure that the threads that; converge at ``U`` are all the threads that reached ``U`` after converging at; ``D``. On most implementations, it is reasonable to assume that only these; threads are converged at every node they reach on any path from ``D`` to ``U``.; In other words, the converged-with relation at ``D`` produces groups of threads; that can converge only within each group, while inside the convergence region of; ``D``.

The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (or form strong references if running under garbage collection).; Object variables of ``__block`` storage type are assumed to hold; normal pointers with no provision for retain and release messages. Foundation defines (and supplies) ``-copy`` and ``-release`` methods for; Blocks. In the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages, we allow the; ``__weak`` specifier for ``__block`` variables of object type. If; garbage collection is not enabled, this qualifier causes these; variables to be kept without retain messages being sent. This; knowingly leads to dangling pointers if the Block (or a copy) outlives; the lifetime of this object.

Method 1 uses internally method 2. Method 2 works for all collection classes. **`TIter`** overloads; `operator()`. Methods 3 and 4 are specific for **`TList`**. Methods 2, 3 and 4 can also easily iterate backwards using either a; backward **`TIter`** (using argument `kIterBackward`) or by using; `LastLink()` and `lnk>Prev`() or by using the `Before()` method. ## The TObjArray Collection.

Chained precompiled headers; ---------------------------. Chained precompiled headers were initially intended to improve the performance; of IDE-centric operations such as syntax highlighting and code completion while; a particular source file is being edited by the user. To minimize the amount; of reparsing required after a change to the file, a form of precompiled header; --- called a precompiled *preamble* --- is automatically generated by parsing; all of the headers in the source file, up to and including the last; ``#include``. When only the source file changes (and none of the headers it; depends on), reparsing of that source file can use the precompiled preamble and; start parsing after the ``#include``\ s, so parsing time is proportional to the; size of the source file (rather than all of its includes). However, the; compilation of that translation unit may already use a precompiled header: in; this case, Clang will create the precompiled preamble as a chained precompiled; header that refers to the original precompiled header. This drastically; reduces the time needed to serialize the precompiled preamble for use in; reparsing. Chained precompiled headers get their name because each precompiled header can; depend on one other precompiled header, forming a chain of dependencies. A; translation unit will then include the precompiled header that starts the chain; (i.e., nothing depends on it). This linearity of dependencies is important for; the semantic model of chained precompiled headers, because the most-recent; precompiled header can provide information that overrides the information; provided by the precompiled headers it depends on, just li",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:24125,depend,depends,24125,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['depend'],['depends']

So, you can expect the same output; from this line as simple `scan-build` would do:. $ intercept-build <your build command> && analyze-build. The major difference is how and when the analyzer is run. The `scan-build`; tool has three distinct model to run the analyzer:. 1.

Everything drawn in a ROOT canvas is an object. There are classes for; all objects, and they fall into hierarchies. In addition, the ROOT has; fully cross-platform GUI classes and provides all standard components; for an application environment with common ‘look and feel'. The; object-oriented, event-driven programming model supports the modern; signals/slots communication mechanism.

Mod/Ref information is; always conservative: if an instruction **might** read or write a location,; ``ModRef`` is returned.

LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================.

We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases.

Integrability,"eful LLVM APIs; ==============================. Here we highlight some LLVM APIs that are generally useful and good to know; about when writing transformations. .. _isa:. The ``isa<>``, ``cast<>`` and ``dyn_cast<>`` templates; ------------------------------------------------------. The LLVM source-base makes extensive use of a custom form of RTTI. These; templates have many similarities to the C++ ``dynamic_cast<>`` operator, but; they don't have some drawbacks (primarily stemming from the fact that; ``dynamic_cast<>`` only works on classes that have a v-table). Because they are; used so often, you must know what they do and how they work. All of these; templates are defined in the ``llvm/Support/Casting.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Casting_8h_source.html>`__) file (note that you very; rarely have to include this file directly). ``isa<>``:; The ``isa<>`` operator works exactly like the Java ""``instanceof``"" operator.; It returns true or false depending on whether a reference or pointer points to; an instance of the specified class. This can be very useful for constraint; checking of various sorts (example below). ``cast<>``:; The ``cast<>`` operator is a ""checked cast"" operation. It converts a pointer; or reference from a base class to a derived class, causing an assertion; failure if it is not really an instance of the right type. This should be; used in cases where you have some information that makes you believe that; something is of the right type. An example of the ``isa<>`` and ``cast<>``; template is:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool isLoopInvariant(const Value *V, const Loop *L) {; if (isa<Constant>(V) || isa<Argument>(V) || isa<GlobalValue>(V)); return true;. // Otherwise, it must be an instruction...; return !L->contains(cast<Instruction>(V)->getParent());; }.

However, if your new View is target specific; AND requires unexposed backend symbols or functionality, you can define it in; the `/lib/Target/<TargetName>/MCA/` directory. To enable this target specific View, you will have to use this target's; CustomBehaviour class to override the `CustomBehaviour::getViews()` methods.; There are 3 variations of these methods based on where you want your View to; appear in the output: `getStartViews()`, `getPostInstrInfoViews()`, and; `getEndViews()`.

C retainable pointer types; --------------------------. A type is a :arc-term:`C retainable pointer type` if it is a pointer to; (possibly qualified) ``void`` or a pointer to a (possibly qualifier) ``struct``; or ``class`` type. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC does not manage pointers of CoreFoundation type (or any of the related; families of retainable C pointers which interoperate with Objective-C for; retain/release operation). In fact, ARC does not even know how to; distinguish these types from arbitrary C pointer types. The intent of this; concept is to filter out some obviously non-object types while leaving a hook; for later tightening if a means of exhaustively marking CF types is made; available. .. _arc.misc.c-retainable.audit:.

Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``.

Integrability,"ementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped.

As described in [1]_ the DDG uses graph abstraction to group nodes; that are part of a strongly connected component of the graph; into special nodes called pi-blocks. pi-blocks represent cycles of data; dependency that prevent reordering transformations. Since any strongly; connected component of the graph is a maximal subgraph of all the nodes; that form a cycle, pi-blocks are at most one level deep.

The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hprof/draw.htm?monitoring=1000>. The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>.

This set of threads doesn't change after; jump-threading, so the answer to the question posed above remains the same. .. _opportunistic_convergence:. Opportunistic convergent operations; -----------------------------------. Some programs have local regions of code that contain a sequence of convergent; operations where the code does not care about the exact set of threads with; which it is executed, but only that the set of threads is the same for all the; operations within the sequence. (If a subset of the convergent operations in the; sequence have additional, non-uniform control dependencies, then this is not; possible. However, the code may still require that the sets of threads are; logically consistent with the conditions of those control dependencies.) In this; case, :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor; <llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor>` can be used to express the desired; semantics. The following example function could be part of a hypothetical ""append buffer""; implementation, where threads conditionally write fixed-sized records; contiguously into a global buffer. The function ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer``; returns the index into the buffer at which the calling thread should store its; data. This could be achieved by using a simple atomic operation in every thread to; bump an allocation counter. However, the following implementation can be more performant on some hardware,; because it uses only a single atomic operation for an entire group of threads.; To do this, it first determines the total size of the group, which ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst:11772,depend,dependencies,11772,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Because all values; in Kaleidoscope are doubles, this makes for very simple code for add,; sub and mul. On the other hand, LLVM specifies that the `fcmp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#fcmp-instruction>`_ always returns an 'i1' value (a; one bit integer). The problem with this is that Kaleidoscope wants the; value to be a 0.0 or 1.0 value. In order to get these semantics, we; combine the fcmp instruction with a `uitofp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#uitofp-to-instruction>`_. This instruction converts its; input integer into a floating point value by treating the input as an; unsigned value. In contrast, if we used the `sitofp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#sitofp-to-instruction>`_, the Kaleidoscope '<' operator; would return 0.0 and -1.0, depending on the input value. .. code-block:: c++.

Integrability,"entation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments. For example, an HTML output might want declaration names be; linkified to where they come from in the source. Another example is that a GUI; might let you click on typedefs to expand them.

External bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ""External"" bounds annotations provide a way to express a relationship between a; pointer variable and another variable (or expression) containing the bounds; information of the pointer. In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a pointer is often available adjacent to the pointer itself, e.g., at another; parameter of the same function prototype, or at another field of the same struct; declaration. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; // off-by-one error; for (size_t i = 0; i <= count; ++i); p[i] = i;; }.

All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should; not have to adhere to special conditions to include the header. Specifically, a; header should have header guards and include all other headers it needs. There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not; self-contained. These are typically intended to be included at unusual; locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use header; guards, and might not include their prerequisites.

The `ROOT::Math::GradFunctor1D` class is used to wrap one-dimensional gradient functions. It can be constructed in three different ways:; * Any object implementing both `double operator()( double)` for the function evaluation and `double Derivative(double)` for the function derivative.; * Any object implementing any member function like `Foo::XXX(double )` for the function evaluation and any other member function like `Foo::YYY(double )` for the derivative.; * Any two function objects implementing `double operator()( double )` . One object provides the function evaluation, the other the derivative. One or both function object can be a free C function of; type `double ()(double )`. #### Wrapping Multi-dimensional Functions. The class `ROOT::Math::Functor` is used to wrap in a very simple and convenient way multi-dimensional function objects. It can wrap all the following types:; * Any C++ callable object implementing `double operator()( const double * )`.; * A free C function of type `double ()(const double * )`.; * A member function with the correct signature like `Foo::Eval(const double * )`. In this case one pass the object pointer and a pointer to the member function `(&Foo::Eval)`. The function dimension is required when constructing the functor. Example of using `Functor`:; ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/Functor.h"". class MyFunction {. public:; double operator()(const double *x) const {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. double Eval(const double * x) const { return x[0]+x[1]; }; };. double freeFunction(const double * x ); {; return x[0]+x[1];; }. int main(); {; // test directly calling the function object; MyFunction myf;. // test from a free function pointer; ROOT::Math::Functor f1(&freeFunction,2);. // test from function object; ROOT::Math::Functor f2(myf,2);. // test fro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:44858,wrap,wrap,44858,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['wrap'],['wrap']

A method may be an instance method, in which case; it can be invoked on objects of the class, or a class method, in which case it; can be invoked on objects of the metaclass.

[receiver foo: fooArg bar: barArg baz: bazArg]. This looks in the dynamic class of the receiver for a method with this name,; then in that class's superclass, etc., until it finds something it can execute.; The receiver ""expression"" may also be the name of a class, in which case the; actual receiver is the class object for that class, or (within method; definitions) it may be ``super``, in which case the lookup algorithm starts; with the static superclass instead of the dynamic class.

Before you can compile your interpreted script you need to add include; statements for the classes used in the script. Once you did that, you; can build and load a shared library containing your script. To load it; use the command `.L` and append the file name with a `+`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+; ```. The + option generates the shared library and names it by taking; the name of the file ""filename"" but replacing the dot before the; extension by an underscore and by adding the shared library extension; for the current platform. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx`; will generate `hsimple_cxx.so`. The + command rebuild the library only if the script or any of the; files it includes are newer than the library. When checking the; timestamp, ACLiC generates a dependency file which name is the same as; the library name, just replacing the 'so' extension by the extension; 'd'. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx` will generate; `hsimple_cxx.d`. To ensure that the shared library is rebuilt you can use the ++; syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```. To build, load, and execute the function with the same name as the; file you can use the `.x` command. This is the same as executing a; named script; you can also provide parameters. The only; difference is you need to append a + or a ++. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x MyScript.C+(4000); Creating shared library /home/./MyScript_C.so; ```. You can select whether the script in compiled with debug symbol or; with optimization by appending the letter 'g' or 'O' after the '+' or; '++'. Without the specification, the script is compiled with the same; level of debugging symbol and optimization as the currently running; ROOT executable.

The fields are the primary data that; backends will process. Note that TableGen assigns no meanings to fields; the; meanings are entirely up to the backends and the programs that incorporate; the output of those backends. .. note::. The term ""parent class"" can refer to a class that is a parent of another; class, and also to a class from which a concrete record inherits. This; nonstandard use of the term arises because TableGen treats classes and; concrete records similarly. A backend processes some subset of the concrete records built by the; TableGen parser and emits the output files. These files are usually C++; ``.inc`` files that are included by the programs that require the data in; those records. However, a backend can produce any type of output files. For; example, it could produce a data file containing messages tagged with; identifiers and substitution parameters. In a complex use case such as the; LLVM code generator, there can be many concrete records and some of them can; have an unexpectedly large number of fields, resulting in large output files. In order to reduce the complexity of TableGen files, classes are used to; abstract out groups of record fields. For example, a few classes may; abstract the concept of a machine register file, while other classes may; abstract the instruction formats, and still others may abstract the; individual instructions. TableGen allows an arbitrary hierarchy of classes,; so that the abstract classes for two concepts can share a third superclass that; abstracts common ""sub-concepts"" from the two original concepts.

This will result in a single binary ``ninja`` in the current directory.; It doesn't require installation and can just be copied to any location; inside ``$PATH``, say ``/usr/local/bin/``:. .. code-block:: console. $ sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin/; $ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ninja. After doing all of this, you'll need to generate Ninja build files for; LLVM with CMake. You need to make a build directory and run CMake from; it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables in an interactive manner. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using Ninja:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja check-all. Other target names can be used in the same way as with make. .. _Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst:8950,interface,interface,8950,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

In previous releases, the default minimizer type that RooFit used was hardcoded to be the original `Minuit`, while RooStats used the default minimizer specified by `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::DefaultMinimizerType()`. Now it is possible to centrally define the global minimizer for all RooFit libraries via `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer()`, or alternatively in the `.rootrc` file by adding for example `Root.Fitter: Minuit2` to select Minuit2. ### Code modernization by using `std::string` in RooFit interfaces. The following lesser-used RooFit functions now return a `std::string` instead of a `const char*`, potentially requiring the update of your code:. - [std::string RooCmdConfig::missingArgs() const](https://root.cern/doc/v628/classRooCmdConfig.html#aec50335293c45a507d347c604bf9651f); ### Uniquely identifying RooArgSet and RooDataSet objects. Before v6.28, it was ensured that no `RooArgSet` and `RooDataSet` objects on the heap were located at an address that had already been used for an instance of the same class before.; With v6.28, this is not guaranteed anymore.; Hence, if your code uses pointer comparisons to uniquely identify RooArgSet or RooDataSet instances, please consider using the new `RooArgSet::uniqueId()` or `RooAbsData::uniqueId()`. ### Introducing binned likelihood fit optimization in HistFactory.

Integrability,"erializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system. A column contains; an arbitrary number of fixed-sized elements of a well-defined set of types: integers and floats of different; bit sizes. A C++ type may be mapped to multiple columns. For instance, an `std::vector<float>` maps to two columns,; an offset column indicating the size of the vector per entry, and a payload column with the float data. Columns are partitioned into **pages** (roughly: TTree baskets) of a few kB -- a few tens of kB each.; The **physical layer** (only) needs to provide the means to store and retrieve pages. The physical layer is; decoupled from the high-level C++ logic. The physical layer implements an abstract page storage interface,; so that dedicated implementations for key-value stores and other storage systems are conceivable.; At this point, the only provided backend stores the pages in ROOT files. RNTuples are further grouped into **clusters**, which are, like TTree clusters, self-contained blocks of; consecutive entries.

The ``ASTReader`` class, which handles the loading of an AST; file, inherits from all of these abstract classes to provide lazy; deserialization of Clang's data structures. ``ASTReader`` implements the; following abstract classes:. ``ExternalSLocEntrySource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``SourceManager`` class, and; is used whenever the :ref:`source manager <pchinternals-sourcemgr>` needs to; load the details of a file, buffer, or macro instantiation. ``IdentifierInfoLookup``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``IdentifierTable`` class, and; is used whenever the program source refers to an identifier that has not yet; been seen.

As explained before various minimization packages can be used when fitting in ROOT.; We have seen before how to configure the `Fitter` class to use different minimization packages; and different minimization options.; When using the `Fit` method the minimization package (and its options) can be selected using the; static methods of the `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions` class.; For example to select `Minuit2` instead of `Minuit` for fitting an histogram do:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit2"");; // fit the histogram histo with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; ```. In the following we will give some brief description of the minimization packages.; The packages all implement the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface which can be use for; finding the minimum of a multi-dimensional function.; The interface is documented in the Mathematical Library Chapter. In addition packages like Minuit or Minuit2 provide their own interfaces. ## MINUIT (Old TMInuit Version). This package was originally written in FORTRAN by Fred James and part; of `PACKLIB` (patch D506). It has been converted to a C++ class by; René Brun. The current implementation in C++ is a straightforward; conversion of the original FORTRAN version. The main changes are:. - The variables in the various `Minuit` labeled common blocks have; been changed to the **`TMinuit`** class data members. - The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the; maximum number of parameters are now data members' arrays with a; dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems by; simply initializing the **`TMinuit`** constructor with the maximum; number of parameters. - The include file `Minuit.h` has been commented as much as possible; using ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:52731,interface,interface,52731,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"ers and exporters. `RooFitHS3` allows to different types of importers and exporters:; *Native* implementations, and *proxy-based* ones. If for a certain; class several implementations are provided, the native; implementation(s) take precedence. ### Writing your own importers and exporters: Proxy-based. Proxy-based implementations can be added very easily and without; actually writing any `C++` code -- you only need to add a short item; to a list in a `JSON` file, namely the; [export keys](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsexportkeys.json); for an exporter, or the; [factory expressions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsfactoryexpressions.json); for an importer. This works in the following way: Every `RooFit` class performs; dependency tracking via proxies, which have names. This can be; exploited to perform the mapping of proxy names to `json` keys upon; export. In the other direction, the `RooWorkspace` has a factory; interface that allows to call any constructor via a string; interface. Hence:; - If a `RooFit` class has no other members aside from proxies, it can; be exported using a set of `export keys`.; - If all relevant members to a `RooFit` class are passed as; constructor arguments, it can be imported using a `factory; expression`. For the importer, an entry in the; [factory expressions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsfactoryexpressions.json); needs to be added as follows:. ``` {.json}; ""<json-key>"": {; ""class"": ""<C++ class name>"",; ""arguments"": [; ""<json-key of constructor argument #1>"",; ""<json-key of constructor argument #2>"",; ...; ]; }; ```. Similarly, for the exporter, an entry in the; [export keys](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsexportkeys.json); needs to be added as follows:. ``` {.json}; ""<C++ class name>"": {; ""type"": ""<json-key>"",; ""proxies"": {; ""<name of proxy>"": ""<json-key of this element>"",; ""<name of proxy>"": ""<json-k",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md:3180,interface,interface,3180,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,2,['interface'],['interface']

To install ROOT you have the choice to; download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer; since it is only \~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The; binaries compiled with no debug information range from \~35 MB to \~45; MB depending on the target platform. The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A:; Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source.; The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT. Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the; right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a; version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is; installed. In such cases you'll have to install ROOT from source.

The MnUserParameterState has to main; purposes:. - It can be used as input to minimization. - The result of the minimization is transformed into the user; representable format by M . For more explanations see [api:state]. ## Input to M ##. The following input combinations to M are possible:. - $\mbox{FCN}$ + parameters + uncertainties. - $\mbox{FCN}$ with gradient + parameters + uncertainties. - $\mbox{FCN}$ + parameters + covariance. - $\mbox{FCN}$ with gradient + parameters + covariance. For each of these combinations the user can chose between a minimal; required interface (using std::vector containers) for the parameters and; uncertainties or a more functional one provided by M .

A null-terminated UTF-8 string that identifies the augmentation to this CIE; or to the FDEs that use it. If a reader encounters an augmentation string; that is unexpected, then only the following fields can be read:. * CIE: length, CIE_id, version, augmentation; * FDE: length, CIE_pointer, initial_location, address_range. If there is no augmentation, this value is a zero byte. *The augmentation string allows users to indicate that there is additional; vendor and target architecture specific information in the CIE or FDE which; is needed to virtually unwind a stack frame. For example, this might be; information about dynamically allocated data which needs to be freed on exit; from the routine.*. *Because the* ``.debug_frame`` *section is useful independently of any*; ``.debug_info`` *section, the augmentation string always uses UTF-8; encoding.*. The recommended format for the augmentation string is:. | ``[``\ *vendor*\ ``:v``\ *X*\ ``.``\ *Y*\ [\ ``:``\ *options*\ ]\ ``]``\ *. Where *vendor* is the producer, ``vX.Y`` specifies the major X and minor Y; version number of the extensions used, and *options* is an optional string; providing additional information about the extensions.

Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessR",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:13033,integrat,integration,13033,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"es that Clang has; historically rejected. In order to parse widely distributed headers for; libraries such as the Active Template Library (ATL) and Windows Runtime Library; (WRL), some template rules have been relaxed or extended in Clang on Windows. The first major semantic difference is that MSVC appears to defer all parsing; an analysis of inline method bodies in class templates until instantiation; time. By default on Windows, Clang attempts to follow suit. This behavior is; controlled by the ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` flag. While Clang delays; parsing of method bodies, it still parses the bodies *before* template argument; substitution, which is not what MSVC does. The following compatibility tweaks; are necessary to parse the template in those cases. MSVC allows some name lookup into dependent base classes. Even on other; platforms, this has been a `frequently asked question`_ for Clang users. A; dependent base class is a base class that depends on the value of a template; parameter. Clang cannot see any of the names inside dependent bases while it; is parsing your template, so the user is sometimes required to use the; ``typename`` keyword to assist the parser. On Windows, Clang attempts to; follow the normal lookup rules, but if lookup fails, it will assume that the; user intended to find the name in a dependent base. While parsing the; following program, Clang will recover as if the user had written the; commented-out code:. .. _frequently asked question:; https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct Foo : T {; void f() {; /*typename*/ T::UnknownType x = /*this->*/unknownMember;; }; };. After recovery, Clang warns the user that this code is non-standard and issues; a hint suggesting how to fix the problem. As of this writing, Clang is able to compile a simple ATL hello world; application. There are still issues parsing WRL headers for modern Windows 8; apps, but they should be addressed soon.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst:6023,depend,dependent,6023,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,2,['depend'],['dependent']

By default, Clang builds C code in GNU C17 mode, so it uses standard C99; semantics for the inline keyword. These semantics are different; from those in GNU C89 mode, which is the default mode in versions of GCC; prior to 5.0. For example, consider the following code:. inline int add(int i, int j) { return i + j; }. int main() {; int i = add(4, 5);; return i;; }. In C99, inline means that a function's definition is; provided only for inlining, and that there is another definition; (without inline) somewhere else in the program.

For each byte of a read R, R\ :sub:`byte`; may see any write to the same byte, except:. - If write\ :sub:`1` happens before write\ :sub:`2`, and; write\ :sub:`2` happens before R\ :sub:`byte`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`1`.; - If R\ :sub:`byte` happens before write\ :sub:`3`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`3`. Given that definition, R\ :sub:`byte` is defined as follows:. - If R is volatile, the result is target-dependent.

The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters. This interface extends the abstract class `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`, with methods to set/retrieve parameter values and to evaluate the function given the; independent vector of values **`X`** and vector of parameters `P`.; More information about the different `ROOT::Math` function interfaces is available in the Mathematical Library chapter. An end-user can convert a **`TF1`** object in a `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, using the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrapperMultiTF1`:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""gaus"");; ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 fitFunction(f1, f1->GetNdim() );; ROOT::Fit::Fitter fitter;; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; ```. When creating the wrapper, the parameter values stored in **`TF1`** will be copied in the `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` object.; The function object representing the model function is given to the `ROOT::Fitter` class using the `Fitter::SetFunction` method. The user has also the possibility to provide a function object, which implements the derivatives of the function with respect; to the parameters.; This information might be useful for some types of fits. In this case he needs to provide the function object as a class deriving from the; `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim` interface.; Note th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:36552,interface,interfaces,36552,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

The descriptor classes contain a copy of the meta-data; they are not linked to an open page source.; A descriptor can be used after its originating page source has been deleted. ### RField<T>; The RField<T> classes are central in RNTuple:; they link the in-memory representation of data types to their on-disk representation.; All field classes inherit from `RFieldBase`. Every type with RNTuple I/O supported has a corresponding RField<T> template specialization.; Complex types are composed of fields and sub fields.; E.g., a `struct` is represented by a parent field for the `struct` itself and a subfield for every member of the `struct`.; Fields of complex types have type-erased versions in addition to the templated ones (e.g., `RVectorField`, `RClassField`).; In this way, fields can be constructed even if the type information is only available at runtime.; To this end, `RFieldBase::Create()` creates an `RField` object from a type string. On the ""in-memory"" side, fields can construct and destroy objects of their wrapped type; (cf. `CreateValue()`, `CreateObject()`, `GetDeleter()` methods).; Existing objects in memory can be bound to fields (cf. `BindValue()` method). On the ""on-disk"" side, fields know about the possible column representations of their wrapped type.; Upon connecting a field to a page source or page sink,; fields create `RColumn` objects and register them with the page source/sink.; When reading and writing data, the field maps the in-memory information of an object to read/write calls on its columns.; For instance, when writing a `std::vector<float>`,; the field writes to an index column (storing information about the size of the vector).; Its subfield writes the actual values to a float column.
