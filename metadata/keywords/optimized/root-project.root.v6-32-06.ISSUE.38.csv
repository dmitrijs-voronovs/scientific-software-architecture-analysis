Modifiability,"The ctor of `GSLMCIntegrator` creates a `GSLRngWrapper` instance on the heap and calls its `Allocate()` member function which in turn allocates memory for a GSL random number generator via `gsl_rng_alloc()`. When the `GSLMCIntegrator` instance goes out of scope, its dtor is invoked which deletes the `GSLRngWrapper` pointer and thus invokes its dtor as well. However, `~GSLRngWrapper()` frees the allocated memory only if `fOwn` pointer is set to true, which is only set so in the assignment operator, but not in the `Allocate()` member function. Therefore, the `GSLMCIntegrator` class is leaking memory. This poses a problem, when doing a large number of integrations inside a for loop.

At the beginning of a task a new input TChain replaced the old input; TChain for that _thread_ in TTreeProcessorMT, causing a destruction of; the previous _thread-local_ TTree.; At the same time, the initialization of a new task _in a different; thread_ could delete the output TTree of a multi-thread Snapshot; action, which was listed in the fClones of the input TTree.; ; This race caused the input ~TTree to access an output tree just; after its deletion, in TTree::CopyAddresses.; ; The root cause of this issue is that TTreeProcessorMT uses thread-local; variables while RDataFrame uses processing slots which threads can; exchange between themselves. I see two options to solve this:; 1. we introduce a `FinalizeTask` method in all `RDataFrame` action helpers, and we use it in `SnapshotHelperMT` to delete the output trees when we are sure that the input tree is still in scope. This is quite easy.; 2. we have `TTreeProcessorMT` delete its thread-local `TChain`s at the end of one task, not at the beginning of the next task in that thread. @etejedor @dpiparo what do you think?; I know @amadio would be happy if we introduced a `FinalizeTask` method in symmetry with the `InitTask` that we already have",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197#issuecomment-398737985:750,variab,variables,750,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197#issuecomment-398737985,1,['variab'],['variables']

And the variable names should not lead to confusion with formula evaluation in Draw (e.g. branch names which are pure numbers). The tests suggested here are:; - test if branch name is a valid c++ variable name (w/o testing keywords).; - test if branch name begins with ""b_"" (potential problem with MakeClass). on top of that, I also have a [black list](https://github.com/pseyfert/tmva-branch-adder/blob/master/src/blacklist.cpp) of unfortunate branch names: methods of TTrees, which would clash in MakeClass, c++ keywords, variable types, and things TTree::Draw can parse (though I don't see how `TTree::Draw(""cos(x)"")` would clash with `TTree::Draw(""cos"")` if there is a variable named `cos`.

Modifiability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings. The new name,; RDefine, clearly describes what the class is supposed to do and it is in; line with RDF's naming convention (we already have RFilter).

Modifiability,"The original issue is with some python tutorial failing on macOS nodes due to; ```; <TNetXNGFile::Open>: [FATAL] Auth failed; ```; Which in turn is due to a failure in loading some xrootd security libraries, among which; ```; [Error ][Utility ] Unable to pre-load libXrdSecpwd.so: Plugin unable to load libXrdSecpwd-4.so; dlopen(libXrdSecpwd-4.so, 256): image not found; ```. This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```.

Clang uses zlib [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L1302) and [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTWriter.cpp#L2052) when building the PCH in `-fmodules-embed-all-files` mode. IIUC, the issue is the way the JIT resolves symbols. Currently, cling's JIT gives a preference to the local content to itself, i.e. resolves symbols from libCling.so first. This would mean that even if we link another version of zlib to libCore, cling will still find the symbols from llvm's library. And that's by design, because we want to resolve the embedded in ROOT LLVM symbols first. Otherwise cling will start picking up random LLVM symbols introducing a lot of compatibility and versioning issues. I'd propose we try to solve this in two steps. First we should try disabling LLVM's zlib from `interpreter/CMakeLists.txt` instead of the current patch. I suspect that LLVM will be able to find and use the system's zlib (in that case we should make sure LLVM links to the version of zlib we expect: @oshadura has a nice test case for it). If that doesn't work we should investigate how we can configure ROOT's LLVM with a custom zlib.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847:1388,config,configure,1388,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847,1,['config'],['configure']

Modifiability,"The reason for this behaviour seems to be that all the Python classes in the reproducer (`B`, `C` and `D`) get a `Dispatcher` wrapper class automatically created (`Dispatcher1`, `Dispatcher2` and `Dispatcher3`, respectively) that inherits from `A`. Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166:230,inherit,inherits,230,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166,2,['inherit'],['inherits']

Modifiability,"The variables present in TError.h are used throughout the ROOT libraries. Anytime one of these variables is requested, e.g. with a simple test such as `python -c ""import ROOT; ROOT.kError""`, the interpreter will lookup the corresponding symbol. Previously, the variables were declared and defined in the header directly but were not generating any symbol since the linkage was internal. With this commit, provide external linkage to these variables so that the corresponding symbols are materialized in libCore.so. As a consequence, a huge number of extra lookups by cling is avoided.

Modifiability,"This PR adds `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, an alternative to `RooMinimizerFcn` that calculates gradient itself outside of Minuit during minimization. To be able to use `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, `RooMinimizer` had to be refactored to be able to use `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instead of the concrete RooMinimizerFcn class. To accomodate this change, several other changes had to be made:; - `_optConst` and `_func` members were removed, since these are now managed by the `*MinimizerFcn`.; - This means also things like function name and title, but also optimization switches, were moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet. The reason for the switch is that the derivator scheme used in `RooGradMinimizerFcn` replicates that of Minuit2, so comparing",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596:209,refactor,refactored,209,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

RooFitZMQ, a wrapper of ZeroMQ functionality used in RooFit::MultiProcess for communication between processes. Modified after [code](https://gitlab.cern.ch/raaij/generate_and_sort/-/tree/master/ZMQ), contributed by @roelaaij. RooFitZMQ maybe still needs some attention, because in its current form it includes a big part of the libzmq source tree (needed for ppoll, see below), which I'm sure causes licensing issues (it's LGPLv3). I'm open to suggestions on how to handle this. To make the above additions possible, some modifications to both RooFit and non-RooFit code were made as well:. 1. In `Minuit2`:; 1. We added a subclass of the AnalyticalGradientCalculator called the ExternalInternalGradientCalculator. Whereas the AGC assumes that the gradient that is passed to it (from outside of Minuit2) is in normal parameter space, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2. To make this all work, we also had to upgrade precision of the transformation",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294:169,refactor,refactored,169,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

Extends the templation to the Plane3D, Transformation3D and Translation3D types.; 2. Where necessary provides specialised methods for the vector types, when the original code was not generic enough to work in both scalar and vector scenarios. Typically this happens in the case of conditionals, where the differences required (booleans versus masks) are difficult to avoid. This PR is not complete, in that there are still some classes in GenVector that still do not support Vc types, as they are still not templated, such as the Rotation like transformations.

Instead, I added a `Clone` method for field descriptors. . <details>; <summary>Discarded rationale for reintroducing copy constructor for field descriptors</summary>; <br>; We wanted to be able to iterate over `FieldDescriptors` in alphabetical order by name, this is implemented in a3a3da6 using a layer of indirection, namely a vector of offsets `RFieldDescriptorRange::fOffsets`. ; I decided on making this an optional adapter method `SortByNames` instead of the default ordering, because it turns out iterating over `FieldDescriptors` is used elsewhere in the code (see improvements in API client code in 222a412). It also removes move-only semantics on `RFieldDescriptor` (my eventual intent is to remove move-only semantics on all `Descriptors`). `RFieldDescriptor` is made up of value-types only, so there are no resources to worry about. . For merging `NTuples`, we need to copy many descriptors (possibly with some small adjustments). ; With move-only semantics, we'd have to implement a `Clone` method for `RFieldDescriptor`. ; This is disadvantageous compared to relying on value semantics. `Clone`, while conceptually simple, is additional code to maintain.; * If we ever add fields to the class, Clone could be buggy (missing the added field); In contrast, the copy constructor will never miss any fields. ; * Move-only object lifetimes are non-trivial to reason about, we increase the risk of introducing UB by relying on a moved-from object, etc. . Regarding performance concerns (`RFieldDescriptor` has a vector member), I think C++ helps us here with Return Value Optimization and copy elision (simplified example here: https://godbolt.org/z/FwmKaD). .

Modifiability,"This commit provides a rewrite of key functions of TGeoParallelWorld, achieving: . (a) faster initialization; (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) ; (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) ; (d) less memory consumption (better memory scalability). The development for this commit was motivated from a use case in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal i",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:23,rewrite,rewrite,23,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

Modifiability,"This commit provides the possibility to pass system library search paths as well as some compiler include paths to ROOT as environment variables.; This has the advantage that ROOT will spawn less sub-processes and we can do the setup only once, instead of doing it for every single executable that is linked to ROOT. The commit does not change any default behaviour! Rather, expert-users may use the new feature by moving the initialization of the search paths to say software environment loading. In ALICE, we do something like. ```; export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=$(LD_DEBUG=libs LD_PRELOAD=DOESNOTEXIST ls /tmp/DOESNOTEXIST 2>&1 | grep -m 1 ""system search path"" | sed 's/.*=//g' | awk '//{print $1}'). export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=$(LC_ALL=C c++ -xc++ -E -v /dev/null 2>&1 | sed -n '/^.include/,${/^ \/.*++/{p}}' | tr '\n' ':' | tr ' ' ':'); ```. speeding up the initialization of our executables at runtime and doing less syscalls that create short-lived processes, for instance calling the compiler. The effect from this operation can be seen by counting the `execve` syscalls in a small example:. ```; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 14 calls. export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=...; export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=...; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 6 calls; ```.

The `cacheValidEntries` method was originally intended to be used in; `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` to mask histogram entries out of the variable; range in case of a subrange fit.

In a subrange fit, the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` is; creating a clone of the dataset with the subrange only using; `RooAbsData::reduce()`. So all entries are valid by definition. 2.

The aforementioned implementation prevented the support for friend chains, since there was no chain to add the friends to, only trees. In this new implementation, TTreeProcessorMT always constructs a chain per TTreeView, from which TTreeReaders are created to operate on ranges of the chain.

Modifiability,"This is a follow-up to 15a14ae6b4c. The `FindCUDA` module is deprecated since CMake 3.10 and the mentioned; commit therefore removed the usage of it.

This was fine for RooFit, but TMVA not only compiles sources with the; NVidia compiler but also uses the CUDA toolkit in regular C++. Therefore, that commit broke the TMVA GPU features. Unfortunately, I didn't notice before, because of this check; in `cmake/modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake`:; ```cmake; if(tmva-gpu AND NOT CUDA_FOUND); set(tmva-gpu OFF CACHE BOOL ""Disabled because cuda not found"" FORCE); endif(); ```. The `CUDA_FOUND` variable is not set anymore now that `FindCUDA` is not; used. That means that `tmva-gpu` was silently disabled, and not building; successfully (which I had wrongly concluded because of the absence of; errors). This check needs to be replaced with; `if( NOT CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER)`. As recommended in the CMake docs, this should be done with the; `FindCUDAToolkit` module, which is what this PR suggests. The `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` command is also replaced with the regular; `add_executable`, because `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` was also deprecated with; `FindCUDA`. Furthermore, all `cuda AND tmva-gpu` checks were replaced with only; `tmva-gpu`, because `tmva-gpu` implies `cuda`. Finally, `stressTMVA` is moved to the `tmva` subdirectory so that it is built in the same cmake project as ROOT; itself, so that we can query the `tmva-gpu` and `tmva-cpu` flags.

Modifiability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable.

Modifiability,"This is done to better separate CUDA-specific code from the generic code; in RooBatchCompute. Two problems are addressed in this commit:. 1. The RooBatchCompute library had too many CUDA specific functions. The virtual RooBatchCompute interface should be backend agnostic, but; it had CUDA specific functions like `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`,; which where only implemented in the CUDA case. So an abstraction; didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics; to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library; are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor; macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. These types are only; available to `nvcc`, and in case gcc is used, these were forward; declared as stucts. This is a hack that should be avoided. In; particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the; same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`; pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,; and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function; should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`; directly. This parameter is removed.

If there is not `python` executable in `$PATH` at this time, that fails. Now, ideally the `python` name should not be hardcoded into the VDT code at all, it should be set dynamically to whatever [FindPythonInterp](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindPythonInterp.html) finds as `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`. But I wanted to solve it at ""this level"" for now. So I changed the code to call CMake explicitly for configuring VDT, in an environment in which `python` should be available.

(The change above in part 1 will not fix this.); For example: If my array is named something like: ""a.b.c[d.e.f]"" where ""a.b.c"" is the array name and ""d.e.f"" is the name of array length int, the logic in the loop will never find the correct leaf size. One could rewrite the logic such that every combination of characters in between "".""'s are tried, but this would be a bit complicated and cumbersome. Instead... Proposed change: Add an overloaded function call for TTreeReaderArray for the user to specify the array-length leaf name:; `TTreeReaderArray<float> myArr(treeReader, ""arrayLeafName"", ""arrayLengthLeafName"")`. With this, the code can attempt the user supplied array length name before it tries to search through the full leaf name for the appropriate combination.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10611:770,rewrite,rewrite,770,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10611,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

Modifiability,"This proposed new Strategy in minuit2 is the same migrad behaviour as Strategy=2 but with the following changes to the Hesse calculation:; * The step and g2 tolerances have been zeroed so that the 7 cycles are forced in the diagonal-term calculation. This was found to be necessary in cases where asimov datasets were used for the minimization and there were very few iterations for the approximate covariance to be determined from. ; * Central finite difference is used for mixed partial derivatives. This requires 3 extra function evaluations per derivative, but is necessary in the case of minima where there is high curvature (in the case of high stats) and the forward finite difference (default) behaviour leads incorrectly to a non-positive-definite covariance matrix; * Return the uncorrected covariance matrix, even if it is not positive definite. This useful for checking just how far from positive-definiteness the matrix is by being able to examine the eigenvalues. . Additionally, a lower bound on the precision allowed for the spread of eigenvalues of the ""hessian"" correlation matrix (computing a correlation matrix with the hessian as if it was a covariance matrix) was reduced from 1e-6 to 1e-12 (see MnHesse.cxx) ... it is not clear why 1e-6 was the lower bound previously, but current machine precision can beat that (I get locally 1e-8). I left a comment about whether this lower bound should be made configurable or not...

Modifiability,"This pull request adds support for the LZ4 compression algorithm (https://code.google.com/p/lz4/). The code is BSD-licensed. The pull-request includes a source tarball (allowing a ""builtin_lz4"" option in CMake analogous to ""builtin_lzma""). I am unable to test this on Windows currently. The LZ4 algorithm focuses on decompression speed while sacrificing compression ratio. Compression level < 4 uses the ""LZ4 compression"" algorithm while compression level >= 4 uses ""LZ4HC"" (HC = high compression) variant. LZ4HC is comparable to zlib in speeds, but has approximately 20% larger file size. To evaluate, I use the Event executable in the test/ directory. I extend this to allow the compression algorithm be specified via CLI. Example invocation:. time ./Event 4000 6 99 1 1000 4; time ./Event 4000 4 99 0 1000 4. Here, the CLI arguments are:; - 1: Number of events (4000); - 2: Compression ratio (6); - 3: Split level (99); - 4: 1 for write, 0 for read.; - 5: Number of tracks per event (1000).; - 6: Compression algorithm (1 = zlib, 2 = lzma, 4 = lz4. 3 is the deprecated zlib-like algorithm).

These changes enable (parallel) vector writes in concrete backends, e.g. in DAOS. Derived classes that do not override the base implementation will see a sequence of calls to `CommitSealedPage()`. The first measurements of vector writes on DAOS based on this PR, indicate an improvement of _an order of magnitude_ in the write throughput. The refactor in this PR passes all the RPageSinkBuf tests. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `CommitSealedPageV()` to the public interface of `RPageSink`. This function carries out a vector write of a number of sealed page ranges. Each range applies to a given columnId.; The default implementation of `CommitSealedPageVImpl()` sequentially calls `CommitSealedPageImpl()` for each page on each range, but derived classes can override it to provide an optimized implementation.; - Use `CommitSealedPageV()` in RPageSinkBuf. If a buffered column contains only sealed pages, commit the whole range; via `CommitSealedPageV()`.; - If all buffered columns consist solely of sealed pages, coalesce all pages to be committed in a single `CommitSealedPageV()` call that includes a sealed page range per column. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

This is considered a bug (see #11732 for all the details).; The implementation provided here also fixes issue #11732.; ; ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `RField<ItemT[N]>` template specialization that matches single-dimension arrays.; - Update `RFieldBase::Create()` to parse types of the form `T[n][m]...`. As of this PR, it returns `R__FAIL()` for multi-dimensional arrays, though it should be trivial to add support for row-major multi-dimension arrays. ; - RClassField: for class members whose type is a C style array, complete the type name with the size for each dimension, e.g. `int[4][2]`; - Add array unit tests. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This pull request introduces ntuple management at the DAOS container level, extending support for more than one ntuple to populate a container. ## Changes or fixes:; - Support for up to 2\^32 - 1 ntuples in a DAOS container, by assigning an index to a previously-unused portion of the DAOS Object ID address space. The index thus induces a subspace dedicated for all objects belonging to a given ntuple. The zeroth space (index `0`) is reserved for any container-wide metadata objects that may need to be stored in the future.; - `ROOT::Experimental::Detail::RDaosContainerNTupleLocator` is a structure that concentrates the functionality for locating and retrieving stored metadata from an ntuple by its name.; - The structure hashes the name into a well-distributed 32-bit index. Collisions are expressly forbidden to simplify implementation; a different ntuple name must be provided to the sink upon creation if an ntuple stored in the container with another name happens to have the same hash (index).; - The sink (in `RPageSinkDaos` ctor) uses the locator to assign an index for a new ntuple, which may fail if the name's resulting hash collides with some other ntuple present unless the name matches. Overwriting (""recreating"") an existing ntuple is allowed in this context.; - The source (in `RPageSourceDaos::AttachImpl()`) locates the ntuple by the name to validate that it is indeed present in storage (otherwise, an exception is thrown). The objects that are read for this validation are reused as part of the ntuple metadata deserialization procedure when attaching. ; - Unit test coverage is provided for the following cases: write and read from different ntuples in a container; and attempt to open an ntuple that was not stored there. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally + cluster on single client with libdaos 2.2.0; - [x] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This somewhat huge commit mainly demotes many class-versions to 0. . If wanted, I can for sure squash some things (right now, the commit messages contain the underlying reasoning). . In ROOT, a lot of classes were equipped with class-versions > 0 even though they are not meant for IO / streaming. ; This produces unnecessary overhead (creation of Streamer() functions) and might be misleading for users (especially if they believe streaming of these classes would be ok and then lose parts of their data). That's even more helpful when testing framework's dataobject-code. . These classes were identified by https://github.com/olifre/rootStaticAnalyzer (a new project still in early stages) and I have created this PR to fix almost all these issues. . The last commit in the series also explicitly marks two members (of TSeqCollection and THashList) as transient, even though these classes are already class-version 0. This is purely to make it more explicit that these are not streamed - and allow for programmatic testing (since then the `kTransient` bit of the `TRealData` will be set correctly). .

Modifiability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:1425,config,configuration,1425,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"To summarize the current intent of the PR and my understanding of the comments here. The PR targets at limiting cling to find modulemap files all over the place. We have advanced the infrastructure so that this is feasible. If we pick up all possible modulemaps on the include paths we have less control and rootcling goes in the opposite direction -- to be able to control much better the environment in which it works (in a previous PRs we have limited the set of flags it can take). As a side effect of this it will fix the module redefinition errors seen in the LCG builds and when ROOT is installed. IIUC the comments are reasonable and suggesting to move away from the ROOT static configuration for the essential directories such as the etcdir, libdir, incdir and so on. IMO, this not part of the PR even though it touches these functions. I support fixing these issues, however, if we want to fix them we will have to write quite a bit of utility functions which already exist in libLLVMSupport.

Modifiability,"Today, I discovered that `ROOT::TestSupport` does not always work as intended: Consider a ROOT7 build without IMT, and the unit tests `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_extended` and `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_storage`. Both call `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` which results in a warning (this should be fixed separately). `TestSupport.cxx` has a `ForbidDiagnostics noDiagCheckerInstance` that should call `SetErrorHandler` and fail the test if there is an unexpected diagnostic. It turns out this works fine for `ntuple_extended` (which is currently failing in configurations without IMT), but not for `ntuple_storage`. The reason seems to be that `ntuple_storage` doesn't use any other code from `ROOT::TestSupport`, and because it's a static library (since https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9528) the linker can just skip it. (This was different for the object library before, there you link in the individual object files.). I'm not sure what the best solution is: Is it possible and reasonable to install object libraries? If not, an ugly approach is to emit an undefined symbol from `TestSupport.hxx` that will force the linker to add the static library...",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828:552,config,configurations,552,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828,1,['config'],['configurations']

Modifiability,"Unfortunately, coming back to this, I'm not sure this change (in its final form) is sufficient: The comment in `~RPageStorage` says that tasks may hold a reference to `this`, which is an instance of a derived subclass (as `RPageStorage` is abstract; and so are `RPageSink` and `RPageSource`). However, once control flow makes it to `~RPageStorage`, the subclass has already been destructed, including its member fields (if my recollection of C++ destructor chains in the presence of inheritance serves well), so we have a race with any task that may try to access one of them. As a concrete case, the summary mentions `RPageSinkBuf::CommitPageImpl()` where the tasks access `fBufferedColumns`. If one of the tasks is only started after `~RPageStorage` calls `WaitForAllTasks`, it will read from an already destructed `std::vector`, which would explain one of the failure modes I still see in CI runs.

Modifiability,"Up to now all ES6 modules were loaded with relative path like `./jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs`. ; This works nice when all used code is located in one sub-directory `./jsrootsys/` which is alias for `$ROOTSYS/js`.; But this does not work when other location has to be used and modules have to reference jsroot code. Solution provided by modern browsers is `importmap` which can look like:; ```; <script type=""importmap"">; {; ""imports"": {; ""jsroot"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs"",; ""jsroot/draw"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/draw.mjs"",; ""jsroot/io"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/io.mjs"",; ""jsrootsys/"" :: ""./jsrootsys/""; }; }; ```.

Special handling of Qt5 is provided - while used there chromium version does not support importmap :(. ; Nevertheless all ROOT web widgets will be working. Provide `tutorials/webgui/custom` demo with usage of user-defined modules for support of custom user classes `TTriangle`. Demo should run witth ACLiC to provide dictionary for the class. Several changes in TWebCanvas and RWebWindowsManager class were done to let configure custom modules paths and register custom classes.; Macro also works in batch mode where workaround has to be implemented - until headless browser will allow to use ES6 modules directly from the file system.

Modifiability,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:1016,refactor,refactor,1016,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

We can also return a `std::vector<std::string>` here. I already talked with @Zeff020 about this change, and he is completely fine with it. The class was also only used by the RooFit Multiprocess developers so far, so changing the interface is fine.

Modifiability,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

The fourth commit is a bug fix, but since it is a rather rare bug that is only triggered in pathological cases (that I happened to trigger in one of the tests added in commit 3) and since it interacts with a specific other part (cache-and-tracking), I thought it was better to keep it separate, so that the commit can explain the rationale for that specific fix well.; 5. Commit 5 is again a minor refactoring to reduce some duplicated code.; 6. Commit 6 adds a strong warning message when fits end after only having tried parameters that give evaluation errors. In such a case, there will not actually be any valid value, but rather the error handling code will return zero as the function value. Minuit sees this as a valid function value and thinks the function converged and so RooFit would also think everything ended well. With this commit, at least a warning is issued. Perhaps this response should be stronger or weaker, that is up for discussion.; 7. Commit 7 applies a recommendation from the Form documentation to replace it with Format.; 8.

Modifiability,"You are adding it to the target, the dependency is explicit in the fact that you need to have a target to pass as argument. You don't need to add the include that the dictionary needs to the executable, you could just add it to the directory includes, but adding to the target is better as it avoids leaking it to subdirectories. You only have to do it before because of Axel's changes that force a manual header search for the dictionary header, so the search paths need to be ready for you to actually find it. In earlier versions of ROOT, not finding this header would not cause a failure, but may have picked up the wrong header and injected a bunch of absolute paths to the dictionary which in turn would end up breaking things. For example, if you know the dictionary header will always just be in the current source directory, you could just set `CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR` to `True` instead, and not add the current directory to the target includes.; ```; $ cmake --help-variable CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; -------------------------.

Modifiability,"You convinced me that the subevent-section tests should be `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`. > From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. You are right! This can easily be confirmed (even just on my x86 laptop) by changing the seed on line 66. Setting it to some other values, the `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fails sometimes (e.g. seed = 24) and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` as well (e.g. seed = 255). Some seeds even make multiple tests fail, e.g. 25534 fails `BinnedDatasetTest.EventSections` and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` and 2 makes both `SimBinnedConstrainedTest` event-splitting tests fail. I was not able to find a seed that fails the other tests, so it seems to be contained to the `*EventSections` tests. To be complete, I think we should add the explanation of why this comparison doesn't work, which is that **the calculations are**, in fact, **different**. We're comparing a single-section (""all events"") calculation to multi-section (""events section 1"" + ""section 2"" + ...). Obviously, this can give differences due to rounding from FMA or just Kahan summation which also has a small error sometimes. In other tests in the `RooAbsL` and other `RooFit::TestStatistics` suite, this doesn't typically apply. In most of the tests, we're trying to do the exact same calculation (""same"" in terms of CPU operations as well), except either in parallel or through the `TestStatistics` classes instead of the old `RooNLLVar` tree. Sometimes different ordering can change results, like the extended term you mentioned, but also the subsidiary term. Anyway, for this PR: I will suggest an explanation comment and after that it can be merged (@guitargeek agrees, we discussed it in the RooFit dev meeting just now).

The OpenStack credentials are defined [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-lcgapp/-/blob/rootci_test/code/manifests/build/root.pp#L43) (using [teigi](https://configdocs.web.cern.ch/secrets/adding.html)). If a malicious actor makes a PR with a job to print the credentials, or to upload a malicious artifact, it would still have to be approved by a maintainer. A safer alternative is not allowing pull request jobs to upload artifacts at all but then we can't run tests in a separate job. It would also cause builds to take more time on average because the object storage will be less populated. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201:508,config,configdocs,508,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201,1,['config'],['configdocs']

Adds a lot of changes to address; https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12270; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201#issuecomment-1417627970. ## Changes or fixes:. - Runs tests on CI (has to be done in the same job for now, at least on PR builds); - Disables use of OpenStack credentials in PR builds; - Loads OpenStack credentials from GitHub secrets on non-PR builds (i.e. valid secrets are no longer stored on runners); - Reduces verbosity in the config files; - Reduces permissions of the build workflow. It can now only read repository (when PR commenting is getting implemented it has to run in a separate workflow anyways); - Re-enables output buffering to improve performance, at the cost of stderr being redirected to stdout. Currently runs tests on **every** type of job, could look into ways to skip it under certain conditions. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12275:499,config,config,499,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12275,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"_Originally posted by @guitargeek in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7859#issuecomment-824967292_. > Hi @hageboeck! For the schema evolution from the previous version, I just made a test myself where I wrote a RooDataHist to a file with ROOT 6.24 and read it back with ROOT master + this PR. Do you think I should implement a unit test for that? I didn't think this was necessary, after all the change is rather trivial (removal of `_realVars` class member). I see that I never really replied to the above:; Yes, I think that kind of a test like this makes sense. Consider this:; - stressRooFit has a reference file that reads in some RooFit objects. This kind of serves as a schema evolution test, but that's more by accident than by design.; - The reference file evolves with ROOT, though! When you find that small things have to be changed, you recreate the reference file by running `./stressRooFit` with the correct arguments.; - Now you are not testing 6.2[02] schema evolution, but whatever was in master when you created that reference. This is not a good and stable test.; - Here's a test suite that tests the I/O of categories across several ROOT versions. It's trivial to extend it by creating another reference file and adding it to the test suite:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2ef9c05a04b4e65d68923737bf115e5410ddf6c3/roofit/roofitcore/test/testProxiesAndCategories.cxx#L57-L130. So the answer is:; It would be preferable to have a similar test to what I pasted above for RooDataHist. A stub is already here for RooDataHistv4:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2ef9c05a04b4e65d68923737bf115e5410ddf6c3/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooDataHist.cxx#L183-L239. By making it a value-parametrised test as for the categories, you could instantiate it very quickly for all RooDataHist versions.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8037:777,evolve,evolves,777,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8037,2,"['evolve', 'extend']","['evolves', 'extend']"

Modifiability,"_This PR is not intended to be merged into ROOT! That's why it's a draft!_. The purpose of this PR is to show which private members I had to make public to access RNTuple in a BulkIO style. Two of these changes were just to parameterize the cluster and page sizes:. * `fClusterSizeEntries` was made public so that I could set it and make it apples-to-apples with the other formats.; * `kDefaultElementsPerPage = 2097152` is large, but 8× less than the maximum size that can be compressed. The maximum is `0xffffff` because the header provides 3 bytes to specify the uncompressed size, so that uncompressed size can't exceed that. The number I chose here is `2**21`, which is 8× below that limit, to allow for 8-byte integers and floating point numbers. What's probably missing here is the logic for splitting the data to be compressed into a series of blocks with this maximum size. (TTree and normal serialized objects do that.). The rest of the changes are just turning private/protected members into public ones so that they can be read directly in a BulkIO style. Here's how that's done: suppose you're filling a buffer named `array` using a `view` of type `V` returned by `GetViewCollection` or `GetView<T>`. We know the `length` of elements to read, so the function is. ```c++; template <typename V, typename T>; void read_from_rntuple_view(T* buffer, V& view, int64_t& offset, int64_t length) {; int64_t current = 0;; while (current < length) {; T* data = (T*)view.fField.Map(offset + current);; int32_t num = view.fField.fPrincipalColumn->fCurrentPage.GetNElements();; int32_t skipped = (offset + current) - view.fField.fPrincipalColumn->fCurrentPage.GetGlobalRangeFirst();; int32_t remaining = num - skipped;; if (current + remaining > length) {; remaining = length - current;; }; if (remaining > 0) {; std::memcpy(&buffer[current], data, remaining*sizeof(T));; }; current += remaining;; }; offset += current;; }; ```.

I also see that this PR has some changes that your cling doesn't have, which is what my test is based on. So, my next step is to test the CUDA mode with the root version.; > ; > One way to test cling within ROOT would be to get this PR and then configure with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLLVM_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -Dclingtest=On` and then type `make -j cling` and that should build the cling binary ready to use. The root PR does not solve my problem. I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine. I'm not sure, if there more cases. @vgvassilev Do you have an idea? Maybe you saw something, which can help me, during your porting work. If not, it is not problem. Then, I simply have to spent more time.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-776591942:2920,config,configure,2920,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-776591942,1,['config'],['configure']

That means, the direct value server `par_mod` is **skipped** now,; misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the; `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it; wrong. That's why this commit suggests to change the logic in `RooRealIntegral`; to always add the next direct value servers that don't depend on the; integration variable, and not the leaves. A unit test that verifies that the value servers of the integral are the; mathematically direct value servers and not the computation graph leaves; is also implemented. Closes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578. The PR also fixes the same problem for the RooProjectedPdf, which is essentially a integral wrapper but it also got the server-client interface wrong. Now, it simply takes over the shape and value servers from the underlying integral, which is now implemented correctly.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11597:1758,variab,variable,1758,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11597,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years back). So even though Python changed how it treats the variable binding in the newer versions, I would say it doesn't harm us by keeping them and might benefit us in the future.

I have been asked to install ROOT v5-34 in a machine that does not have an internet connection. My configure line is:; ```; ./configure --prefix=/software/root/5.34; ```; But it fails to find the LZ4 library as shown below in the output of the `configure` command:; ```; Checking whether to build included lz4 ... yes; ```; Even if the library can be found in the PATH by the command `which`. This is a problem, because it will then try to download the package and it will fail. So I try the following configure line:; ```; ./configure --prefix=/software/root/5.34 --disable-builtin-lz4; ```; But the option is ignored and the output of the configure shows that it will build the builtin_lz4 (and therefore download it from internet):; ```; Enabled support for asimage, astiff, builtin_afterimage, builtin_glew, builtin_lz4, cintex, explicitlink, fftw3, gviz, genvector, krb5, memstat, opengl, reflex, shadowpw, shared, ssl, tmva, vdt, x11, xft, xml.; ```; I was able to bypass the behaviour for the version 6.24 using `cmake` with the following line:; ```; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<some-path> -Dasimage=on -Dcocoa=on -Dvdt=off -Dxrootd=off -Dclad=off <path-to-source>; ```; Again, for version 6.24, I was not able to use the `--disable` option, but somehow, this combination of options resulted in the bypassing of the builtin-lz4.

Modifiability,"`from ROOT import *` leads to a segmentation violation when used with Python 3.6. One could try fixing it instead of disabling it but the code which is used to install the lookup handler in the module `RootModule::SetRootLazyLookup` depends on internal CPython implementation details of the dict class which are not part of the public API. As a consequence keeping this alive will lead to very; fragile code, require continuous effort to adapt to internal changes and cause a lot of #ifdef handling. (as a matter of fact, Python 3.7 would probably already require new changes to this code already). . Also there's a statement in the bug report that `from ROOT import *` is broken in Python 3 so I don't understand why it's not disabled as it will only confuse users: https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8931. As such I would propose to instead have a clear error message that `from ROOT import *` does not work.

Modifiability,"`gInterpreter::ProcessLine` has an important run-time cost.; Instead of calling it everytime the jitting of an action is required, we now store all the strings that are to jit in TLoopManager and do a single call to `gInterpreter::ProcessLine` before running the event-loop. A couple of life-time issues had to be resolved for this to work properly: in order to let result proxies and action helpers share ownership of the result object, I introduced (simple) manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr (weird, I know). In order to deal with deferred jitting of an action that hangs from a node whose `TInterface` has already been destroyed (can happen due to the deferral of jitting) all `BuildAndBook` functions have been made independent of `TInterface`. In the long term it might be possible to refactor the jitting mechanism so that the `TAction` (and the `TTreeReaderValue/Array`s that it contains) is jitted but the action helpers are not, lifting the requirement of manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr. Although this should be possible in principle, I currently don't see how we could integrate it with the existing logic, so I decided for this much less invasive solution. Before/after runtimes for two extreme scenarios:. `test_inference.cxx` (which performs a lot of jitting).; compile time: ~8s -> ~9s; run time: ~40s -> ~7s. 50 jitted Histo1D calls in a loop (thanks to Attila for the use-case):; run time: ~35s -> <2s.

I will push the change to this PR once my build process succeeded to make sure everything compiles and works (at least on my system). Edit: Sorry, I somehow missed the configure & make part.

Modifiability,"a/browse/ROOT-5157. Chapter on schema evolution support needs to be added to the Users' Guide.; For example bases in the scenario:. ```cpp; class Position { /* point in 3D space */; public:; Position(float x, float y, float z);; // get Cartesian coordinates; float x();; float y();; float z();; // get spherical coordinates; float r();; float phi();; float theta();; // get pseudorapidity; float eta();; };. class Hit : public Position { /* localized detector signal */; public:; Hit(float energy, float x, float y, float z);; // get energy and transverse energy; float e();; float et();; };; ```. * Now, consider 3 stages of evolution for Position:. 1. Simplest implementation is to have Cartesian coordinates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct). Could you please provide a working example in which data are saved and fetched with different combinations of (1, 2, 3)x(a, b, c) (at least with 1a, 2b, 3c)?. * The next step is to consider collections of objects:. i) define. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit > m_hits;. };; ```. ii) Because the crazy developers of Hi",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14540:1102,evolve,evolves,1102,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14540,1,['evolve'],['evolves']

Modifiability,"acters (`[` and `]`, in this case), and these characters end up in variable names in the .C macro. I have included a reproducer below (`test_plot_macros.cpp`) which produces three .C macros, two of which are broken as described above.; For instance, in `plot1.C` (one of the produced macros), one can find invalid code such as ; ```cpp; Double_t pdf_Norm[x]_fx1[114] = {; -10.2002,; -10.2,; ...; ```. Would it be possible to filter these special characters when producing the macros?. ### Reproducer. Create a file `test_plot_macros.cpp` containing the script below and run `root test_plot_macros.cpp`. ```cpp; #include ""TCanvas.h"". #include ""RooArgSet.h""; #include ""RooDataSet.h""; #include ""RooGaussian.h""; #include ""RooPlot.h""; #include ""RooRealVar.h"". using namespace RooFit;. void test_plot_macros() {; // Create a PDF; RooRealVar x(""x"", ""x"", -10, 10);; RooRealVar mean(""mean"", ""mean"", 0, -10, 10);; RooRealVar width(""width"", ""width"", 2, 0, 5);; RooGaussian gaus(""pdf"", ""pdf"", x, mean, width);. // Generate some data; RooDataSet* data = gaus.generate(RooArgSet(x), Name(""data""), NumEvents(2000));. // Plots; TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(""c"");. // Plot 1; // Broken .C macro because of default pdf ""Name()""; RooPlot* frame1 = x.frame();; data->plotOn(frame1);; gaus.plotOn(frame1);; frame1->Draw();; c->SaveAs(""./plot1.png"");; c->SaveAs(""./plot1.C"");. // Plot 2; // Not broken .C macro because of explicit (and safe) ""Name()"" configuration; RooPlot* frame2 = x.frame();; data->plotOn(frame2);; gaus.plotOn(frame2, Name(""gaus""));; frame2->Draw();; c->SaveAs(""./plot2.png"");; c->SaveAs(""./plot2.C"");. // Plot 3; // Broken .C macro again because special charecters are not filtered from ""Name""; RooPlot* frame3 = x.frame();; data->plotOn(frame3);; gaus.plotOn(frame3, Name(""a+b""));; frame3->Draw();; c->SaveAs(""./plot3.png"");; c->SaveAs(""./plot3.C"");; }; ```. ### ROOT version. 6.24.06. ### Installation method.

Modifiability,"and it gets only worse over time. And so far I have the feeling ROOT will still be there in the next decade or the one after. And if these codes stay around than they should be maintained and improved occasionally. Of course maintenance takes resources. And I know that nobody ever has time to do it. But leaving everything as is in the face of possible improvements also has a cost that we pay be doing nothing. For this particular PR, if I jump into a header file, I do not know which methods are overriding something from a base class. But this knowledge helps me when reading new code. Now I pay the cost for having to look this information up in the inheritance hierarchy. In recent years we are lucky enough to even have automatic refactoring tools. They are far from perfect. But they are good. And applying them has very little cost for a moderate benefit. So I think at least those automatic refactorings should be applied to old code. Regular manual refactoring of production code would be even better, but I know I live in a dream world here ;). There is also the broken window theory, stating that code with bad quality encourages people working on it to also tolerate new code to be bad. I just started here in ROOT and I already heard from a few people that ROOT code is bad and I should have low expectations. So if we would improve the old code just a little we could also improve this mindset by a bit 👍 . So please consider to apply at least automatic refactorings!. > We cannot merge this as is. @bernhardmgruber what do you want to do with this? Can we close this, discuss, and then do what we converged on? I don't think this ""monster PR"" :-) will survive without conflicts for long, and it still needs a ton of work. @hageboeck mentioned somewhere to me that he would prefer to have smaller PRs just targeting subparts of ROOT, even if the changes are simple/automatic. I guess I could break up the PR into smaller pieces.

Modifiability,"ates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct). Could you please provide a working example in which data are saved and fetched with different combinations of (1, 2, 3)x(a, b, c) (at least with 1a, 2b, 3c)?. * The next step is to consider collections of objects:. i) define. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit > m_hits;. };; ```. ii) Because the crazy developers of Hit decided to make such class variable size, one needs to store a vector of pointers instead of objects:. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit* > m_hits;. };; ```. iii) Disk space is very short! We cannot waste the single 32-bits word used by the STL vector... ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; unsigned int m_Nhits;; Hit* m_hits; //[m_Nhits]. };; ```. Please, provide some working example that shows how to write and read all these 3 evolutions of Track (you may use whatever version of Hits). . [Courtesy of Diego Casadei]. ### ROOT version.

Modifiability,"ation based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `...Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. ## Todo:. There are still a couple of things that require attention, which I hope the reviewers can help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_types.h`: maybe we could replace this with @guitargeek's new configuration structs.; 4. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test. Finally, one thing that in an ideal world I would have liked to do is add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, I'm rather short on time right now, and these things almost always tend to take longer than one expects, so I'm hesitant to build it now. The **advantage** would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the `MultiProcess` minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `Li",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700:2058,config,configuration,2058,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700,1,['config'],['configuration']

A check with `readelf` reveals the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` is the reason for this problem. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/root/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:2697,Config,Configure,2697,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,1,['Config'],['Configure']
Modifiability,"ber of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_type""); ```. That leak occurs when `findScope` in the LookupHelper starts parsing whenever `quickFindDecl()` fails (it's nothing to do with `mpz_class` or `ClassInfo_IsEnum` per se, just that that's where it was first found).

I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine.

Modifiability,"c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_type""); ```.

Modifiability,"ce, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2. To make this all work, we also had to upgrade precision of the transformation functions to long double instead of double, otherwise round off errors would still persist and ruin any chances of exact bit-wise equality.; 2. In `mathcore`: Some additions to `IFunction` were made to allow Minuit2 to probe functions for their ability to generate gradients and second derivatives. Similar additions were made to function adapter classes in Minuit2.; 3. In RooFit:; 1. Most RooMinimizerFcn functionality was moved into an abstract base class RooAbsMinimizerFcn, which in turn forms the base class of the new RooMinimizerFcn, but also of the added RooGradMinimizerFcn (serial, but gradient external to Minuit2) and MinuitFcnGrad (with parallel MultiProcess back-end) classes.; 2. The RooRealMPFE based classes can make use of an added parameter `CPUAffinity`. In Unix systems (not macOS), this makes the MPFE based parallelization a lot faster by pinning processes to physical CPU cores.; 3. To accomodate the new minimization frameworks, RooMinimizer was changed quite a bit as well. It is still backwards compatible, but the new functionality can be accessed through a new `create` template factory function. This template function allows users to pass in their own calculation back-ends, e.g. for calculating on GPUs or in autograd enabled frameworks.

It may be that because I have other versions of LLVM/Clang in the system, z3 got installed and picked up by the builtin LLVM from the ROOT build. Ideally, this sort of behavior of automatically picking whatever is installed on the system should be avoided, as it can cause problems, so I recommend looking into the configuration of the builtin LLVM more closely and either disabling z3 if not used, or adding it to the dependencies of ROOT and enabling by force. - Test tutorial-v7-ntuple-ntpl005_introspection failure is related to uring support, is that tested in nightlies?

As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:3041,config,config,3041,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,3,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"clad is a C++ plugin for clang and cling that implements automatic; differentiation of user-defined functions by employing the chain rule in; forward and reverse mode, coupled with source code transformation and AST; constant fold. In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a; set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function; specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer; program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary; arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.); and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain; rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can; be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at; most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original; program. AD is an alternative technique to symbolic and numerical differentiation.; These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads; to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of; converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical; differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization; process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with; calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase.; Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial; derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for; gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves; all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more software; dependencies. This patch allows ROOT to interoperate with clad. Namely, users can ask; the interpreter to produce a derivative or a gradient to a known function.

Drop `.clingrc` for now and keep `.cling_profile` only ? If a cling script can easily tell if it is in interactive mode then keeping only 1 script makes sense. Otherwise it is better to keep both to align with bash and other interpreter inspired by bash design. By easily telling I mean a macro like `CLING_INTERACTIVE` or something simple that does not access `gCling`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11262#issuecomment-1229254493:79,config,config,79,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11262#issuecomment-1229254493,3,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"cribe the bug. When adding two histograms, the weights associated with the bin contents of those histograms should also be added appropriately. `THnSparse` does not do this. It still reports the weights of the first histogram, ignoring the second. ### Expected behavior. The sum of weights should include the weights of both histograms that were added together. ### To Reproduce. The script is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5wvixrmdtdx3b5/testTHNadd.C?dl=0; (GitHub apparently does not allow attaching .C files). ```bash; root -b -l -q testTHNadd.C; ```. This script shows the bug by comparing two cases:; 1. Filling one histogram twice; 2. Filling two histograms once and adding them.

Modifiability,"declares its dependency on VDT in a very silly way that does not make any sense to me...). Even though it clearly ""publicly"" depends on those headers. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/vecops/inc/ROOT/RVec.hxx#L54. ### Expected behavior. When using the exported target `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`, I would expect to be able to use `RVec.hxx` just by linking my own target against `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`. Not having to care about the ""internal"" dependency of the ROOT code on VDT myself. To fix, the following should happen:; - VDT should be used in the ROOT CMake configuration through an imported target, not through `${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}` and `${VDT_LIBRARIES}`. (Since these make relocation very hard.); - Once `ROOTVecOps` depends on a library like `VDT::vdt`, `ROOTConfig.cmake.in` will need to include. ```cmake; find_dependency(VDT); ```. somewhere around here: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/cmake/scripts/ROOTConfig.cmake.in#L88-L99. In such a setup, as long as `builtin_vdt` is ""correctly"" installed alongside ROOT, the configuration should start becoming correct under all circumstances. ### To Reproduce. Don't really have a reproducer. But a CMake project like:. ```cmake; cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.10 ); project( VecOpsTest ). find_package( ROOT REQUIRED ). add_executable( VecOpsTest VecOpsText.cpp ); target_link_libraries( VecOpsTest PRIVATE ROOT::ROOTVecOps ); ```. , with a simple. ```c++; #include <ROOT/RVec.hxx>. int main() { return 0; }; ```. (as `VecOpsTest.cpp`) should be able to produce an error. As long as ROOT and VDT headers are not in the same location. Which is usually the case unfortunately... ### Setup. This is primarily an issue with ""LCG builds"" of ROOT. Where currently we have to manually take care of linking our code explicitly against VDT, even if we don't use those headers directly ourselves. ### Additional context.

The build starts ""pretty much"" at the left hand side of the timeline, and lasts until ""pretty much"" the right hand side of it. As you can see, the build starts out very well. Building LLVM scales perfectly to 64 threads. And I believe it would scale well to even beyond that. But once the LLVM build is done, many bottlenecks show up. First there is a big bottleneck with building `libCling` and `rootcling`, but after that the build of `libRIO` is also taking a surprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.). The reason I blame the dictionary generat",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432:1290,config,configuration,1290,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432,1,['config'],['configuration']

Executor | Map | Reduce | MapReduce | Foreach | Chunking | Parallel reduction | ; ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |; TExecutorCRTP | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |; TExecutor | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ |; TThreadExecutor | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |; TProcessExecutor | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |; TSequentialExecutor | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |. * [WIP] All common interfaces (no chunking, no foreach, no parallel reduction) are declared in the base class, TExecutorCRTP. Among these, the only three differing Map implementations call MapImpl, deleted functions on the base class and expected to be implemented by the child classes. * Every other interface (chunking, foreach, parallel reduction) is declared and implemented in the executor that supports it. ### TODO.

Modifiability,"e code, from 10k+ to a manageable level of under 1k (and going down). However, currently, there is no safeguard to prevent new commits from introducing new errors, which is prone to happen, as not everyone is familiar with the doxygen syntax. To maintain in a sustainable way the 'clean status' of the reference guide and online documentation, it would be helpful to add an automation script that compiles the documentation only with the files modified in the Pull Request to be merged, in the same way that a bot checks now about clang-format, etc. Because Doxygen can be configured to have only one input file, this extra check will not involve much time as compared to building the whole documentation. Then, it could be checked whether no warnings are produced by the 'touched' files. ### Optional: share how it could be improved; - [ ] The Github action or CI script should modify the -DDOCU_INPUT CMake flag to only add those touched by the Pull Request; - [x] The INCLUDE_PATH in the Doxyfile should be extended (for good, not just in the script) to all possible include folders, as you might touch a 'source file', but would get a bunch of warnings if Doxygen does not find the corresponding include path. (This is not the case in the full build, as the include files are also part of the INPUT, but wouldn't be the case if we just 'touch' the sources in the PR).; - [ ] The WARN_LOGFILE (-DDOCU_LOGFILE in cmake) should be set by the CI script to a useful filename. If the file is empty after running doxygen, the Test passes.; - [ ] Optional: HAVE_DOT, listLibs, etc. could be set to NO in case a speedup is wanted.; - [ ] Potentially hook it also up with spell-checking checks, see https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell; - [ ] Alternative approach suggested by albert-github to avoid missing references: use the overnight tag file from https://root.cern/reference/ with the pull request update test; - [ ] https://github.com/root-project/jenkins-pipelines/issues/10 jenkins parsing",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9953:1154,extend,extended,1154,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9953,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"e moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet. The reason for the switch is that the derivator scheme used in `RooGradMinimizerFcn` replicates that of Minuit2, so comparing to that makes more sense. Also, it just hasn't been tested at all with Minuit 1, I'm not even sure it will work with that version. Other than these `RooMinimizer` changes and the addition of `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new test was added called `testRooGradMinimizer`. It also uses a `test_lib.h` header that will also be used later on in tests of other new likelihood minimization implementations. **Do note that the test currently fails.** I originally had carefully made sure the results were bit-wise exactly the same as those from using classic `RooMinimizerF",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596:1495,refactor,refactor,1495,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"e, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:2945,portab,portability,2945,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,1,['portab'],['portability']

Modifiability,"e. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros. Level 1 would enable the warning messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag WARNINGMSG is defined. Level 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined.

Modifiability,"eighted samples. It should be clarified both in the code documentation and in the user guide, if the implementation can handle weighted templates in the asymptotic limit, by applying the SPD approximation discussed by Bohm and Zech, 2014. This is possible (as we show in our paper https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), but only if the implementations handles this special case. Conway's paper does not discuss weighted templates and does not explain how to use the SPD approximation in this context. Long version:. The code documentation of RooBarlowBeestonLL on the master is incorrect. It is stated that this class implements the Barlow-Beeston likelihood computation, but it actually implements an approximation introduced by Conway in 2011. The approximation is only asymptotically equivalent to Barlow-Beeston, for small samples it is inferior. We recently published a paper about a new approximation to Barlow-Beeston (https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), which is fast to compute and can be used with weighted templates and weighted data. In this paper, we compare the performance of Barlow-Beeston and several approximations including ours. It is shown there, that Conway's approximation is inferior to the exact computation by Barlow-Beeston. I was pointed to this class by the LHCb collaboration. There is uncertainty in the community what this class actually computes and whether it is asymptotically correct for weighted templates. I kindly ask to correct and extend the documentation. **I think the best solution is to revert the implementation of BarlowBeestonLL to actually implement the original BarlowBeeston.** Then make a new class called ConwayLL which implements Conway's approximation. I am happy to provide another class which implements our method in ROOT. So far, the reference implementation is in the iminuit Python package. ### ROOT version.

Modifiability,"er/CMakeLists.txt` and runtime searches in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CIFactory.cpp`. Below I'm listing a number of things I noticed, and I think it would be worth it to clean up this business:. - [ ] Let's start with the obvious: `CLING_CXX_PATH` and `CLING_CXX_HEADERS` are declared as `option`s in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CMakeLists.txt`. This gives them a type of `BOOL` instead of `STRING` (or maybe `FILEPATH` for `CLING_CXX_PATH`?).; - [ ] If these variables are not set by the user, the build system starts to make some guesses. These choices are not `FORCE`d back into the `CACHE`, so it will be re-computed on every CMake invocation.; - [ ] The code for determining `CLING_CXX_PATH` has a large section dealing with `ccache` and `distcc`, which can only be taken if users set the environment variable `CXX=""ccache g++""`. Since CMake 3.4, it is recommended to instead use `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`, or ROOT's `ccache=ON`, so this may be obsolete?; - [ ] The header lookup is inconsistent between the build system and the `CIFactory`: The messages during configuration suggest that the order is; 1. Determined directories of C++ headers, or if not found; 2. Invocation of the compiler's full path, or as a fallback; 3. Invocation of the compiler's relative path. I think this matches the initial implementation, but it's not true anymore since commit afabc3b63885427251fd69b4aeda887bae35a289 switched to asking the compiler in the `PATH` first, to address a problem report from CMS.; - [ ] It also appears that the default guess from the build system is to *either* set the compiler's full path *or* its relative path. This is potentially problematic because changing the `PATH` could make the interpreter pick up a different compiler, even though it could still ask the existing full path. It's also inconsistent with respect to the previous point because a compiler in `PATH` takes precedence over the directories determined at build time, while a compiler out",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612:1241,config,configuration,1241,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"ery strict source compatibility requirements: ""we should only break source compatibility if the ROOT constructs were actively harmful in some way, the volume of affected ROOT code is relatively small, and we can provide source compatibility and migration"". As discussed with @pcanal, and with TExecutor introduced in ROOT 6.08, there's little possibilities any user has implemented a new derived class from TExecutor. If this happened, the user is most probably advanced enough to be able to change the implementation. In any case, the volume of affected ROOT code will be relatively small. . As suggested by @dpiparo, for the moment we will keep the new ```TExecutor``` in ```ROOT::Internals```, not exposing it to the user. The executor usage will look as following:. ```cpp ; ROOT::Internal::TExecutor pool(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial);; auto mapFunction = [](unsigned i){return 1u;};; auto reductionFunction = [](const std::vector<unsigned> &v) {; return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0u);; };. pool.MapReduce(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial, mapFunction, ROOT::TSeq<unsigned>(20), reductionFunction);; ```. **TLDR;** This PR changes the behaviour of existing executors and introduces; new ones:. * TExecutor: changes its functionality to be a general Executor, while; TExecutorBaseImpl takes the role of the previous TExecutor. TExecutor; now acts as a general interface to the executors. The executor it will; resolve to is specified by a execution policy parameter in its; constructor. * TExecutorBaseImpl: Plays the previous role of TExecutor. * TSequentialExecutor: provides a sequential implementation of the; executor model, defined by TExecutorBaseImpl. This PR is not finished, but I'm opening it for discussion. Things left:; - [x] Change kSerial to kSequential. - [x] Move Execution Policies to ROOT::Internal. - [x] Adapt Fitting functions to use the new TExecutor instead of if statements.

Modifiability,"es.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```.

Modifiability,"evel 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros. Level 1 would enable the warning messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag WARNINGMSG is defined. Level 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero.

Modifiability,"far to little context to understand what you are trying to solve here. I assume something broke when you switched to C++20. C++20 (leaving `operator<=>` on the side for now) introduced comparison rewrite rules which may be a potential cause. E.g. an expression `tstring == charptr` can now be rewritten by the compiler to `operator==(charptr, tstring)`. This is further complicated by the presence of non-`explicit` unary constructors, since the compiler can use such constructors to perform conversions in order to be able to rewrite comparisons. Looking at `TString.h`, I see lots of non-explicit constructors, non-explicit conversion operators (to `std::string_view` and `std::string`) in the header file (clang-tidy fills up the file with warnings on these). I strongly suspect that the compiler could somehow rewrite a comparison using any of the conversions and find a better match. I strongly believe adding `operator<=>` does not solve anything but just hides an existing problem. Also this block:; ```c++; #ifndef WIN32; // To avoid ambiguities.; inline Bool_t operator==(const char *s1, const std::string_view &s2) { ... }; inline Bool_t operator==(const std::string_view &s1, const char *s2) { ... }; #endif; ```; fosters my believe that there is already something fishy. I would advice to step through a failing unit test in C++20 mode and observe what overloads and conversions are picked .; I am also scared by e.g. defining `operator==(const TString &s1, const char *s2);` at the beginning of the file and the symmetric `operator==(const char *s1, const TString &s2)` at the end. If there is any call to ` charptr == tstring` anywhere in-between, you would get a conversion in C++17 `TString(charptr) == tstring` and a rewrite in C++20, which could change behavior if there is an inconsistency anywhere. I would advice to refactor and keep asymmetric operators close together. (And just a though: you could just delete all comparisons, and rely on the conversion to `std::string_view`)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12525#issuecomment-1479606106:1891,rewrite,rewrite,1891,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12525#issuecomment-1479606106,2,"['refactor', 'rewrite']","['refactor', 'rewrite']"

Modifiability,"first and; second derivatives of the scale factors are smooth. The `PiecewiseInterpolation` class is more general, because instead of; taking constant interpolation parameters, it takes other `RooAbsReals`.; That means it makes no sense for that class to cache the polynomial; coefficients that have to re recomputed anyway each time the input; changes. It uses an optimized formula to do the interpolation on the; fly. The `FlexibleInterpVar` however precomputes and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero. It was also checked that this change has no performance; effect on fitting the full ATLAS Higgs combination modes. ```txt; param ref new diff_abs diff_rel; 0 -1.00 0.9000000000 0.9000000000 0.0000000000 0.00E+00; 1 -0.95 0.9047424331 0.9047437816 0.0000013485 1.49E-06; 2 -0.85 0.9140836603 0.9141118876 0.0000282273 3.09E-05; 3 -0.75 0.9230659064 0.9231653329 0.0000994265 1.08E-04; 4 -0.65 0.9317147727 0.9319176341 0.0002028614 2.18E-04; 5 -0.55 0.9402402768 0.9405514067 0.0003111300 3.31E-04; 6 -0.45 0.9489635592 0.9493568763 0.0003933171 4.14E-04; 7 -0.35 0.9582539443 0.9586769214 0.00",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067:1189,Flexible,FlexibleInterpVar,1189,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067,1,['Flexible'],['FlexibleInterpVar']

Modifiability,"fixes #7584 . This PR shows a possible refactor of the logic that finally creates the ranges to send to the distributed resources. It works in the following steps:; 1. Split the big HeadNode class in differente head node types according to the original data source (e.g. EntriesHeadNode, TreeHeadNode, in the future also RNTupleHeadNode). Use a factory to get the correct head node type according to user provided arguments to the RDataFrame constructor; 2. Create a different Range type per each head node type. This makes the passing of information more modular, allowing sending only a couple of integers in the case of empty RDF , or adding info about friend trees in the case of a tree based RDF; 3. Better support friends with the recently introduced `ROOT::Internal::TreeUtils` functions; 4. NEW: Cache the created `Range`s for reuse in the same python session.

Modifiability,"g the output of some ML pipeline during the execution of the analysis is definitely something we want to address. For what concerns this specification, the easy part is just deciding for something more generic than ""treenames"" when specifying these other data formats; the trickier part is deciding how these other input data should be read. See the next comment for more discussion about this. > The more general term for this is a a join, and I think you should use that concept here rather than the precise concept of friends in TTree/RNtuple. Yes I agree we can describe adding more columns to the main dataset as a join, with the implicit but crucial clarification that it is a view on the join operation and not a concrete join operation that would involve copying the two operands. With this sense, a friend TTree is equivalent to a left join where both unique IDs correspond to the event index and are the same number. I completely agree that this is a limit, indexed friends only extend it a little bit by allowing different sets of event indexes in the two tables. The idea of an heterogeneous dataset layout, with some datasets/samples having to be left-joined and others having to be inner-joined (for example), involves some design work and I would like to discuss it further, although I'd like to get a better idea of the use cases that need any joins other than left join. > Entry ranges: I don't think this is very useful data to record. This is either kept track of as a good-luminosity block list, or specified at execution time by the user. During the meeting a few weeks ago there was quite a large consensus on this information being useful when written at the datasets/samples level.

Modifiability,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3.

Modifiability,"hDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can see, so that's still a minor weakness, but I guess that could easily be added in the documentation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:1173,variab,variables,1173,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"have this feature is that I realized that lines with a width of 1 can become badly visible in presentations or on posters which is why I prefer to use line width 2 as default everywhere. For the implementation via the marker styles as you propose I see basically 2 ways to implement this:; 1. At the moment we have marker styles up to 49. One could just start to redefine all existing marker styles where a linewidth makes sense from 50 upwards with a linewidth of 1, 2, 3 ...; However, I think this might become confusing if further styles are added in the future, because then there will be no logic behind the numbers and the corresponding markers, although there is not much logic behind the style numbers right now too.; 2. One could define it in a way that adding 100 to the marker style corresponds to an increase of the linewidth of 1. As an example the regular + marker with linewidth 1 would be 2, with linewidth 2 it would be 102, with linewidth 3 202 ...; I know this would be rather equal to defining a standalone linewidth attribute, but it would allow us to add up to 50 additional marker styles in the future without breaking the logic and I doubt we will have more than 100 different marker styles one day. Since you are the responsible coordinator for the graphics part of ROOT, I think this decision should be up to you. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

Modifiability,"his:; ```; y; B; y; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx A xxxxxx; y; y; ```; where A and B are the minima along the x and y axis respectively. This approach has the advantage that the number of function evaluations scales like with k * n, where k is the number of dimensions and n the number of steps per dimension, while a full grid search scales like n ^ k. However, this approach will fail miserably when x and y are correlated, trying this on the Rosenbrock function for instance gives terrible results (basically no improvement with respect to the starting value). ### What to do?. The current behavior of MnScan is not what people usually consider a scan, which most people understand as a full grid search over the whole N-dimensional space. It seems that MnScan is not really used in ROOT, but I may be mistaken. If it is not really used, I would suggested to keep the name MnScan and change the implemenation to do a full hypercube scan. I am strongly convinced that MnScan should do a full grid search instead of what it currently does, because the current implementation is fairly pointless for most real-world functions which have correlations. If MnScan has a use case that I am not aware of, then I propose to add a new Minimizer, MnHyperScan (or similar name), which implements the full scan. ### Other issues with current MnScan. - One cannot configure the number of steps taken per dimension when MnScan is called through the minimizer interface (MnApplication). The maxcalls option should be used for this.; - A gradient and second derivatives are computed for the starting values, only to be discarded. This is wasteful.; - The scan returns EDM = 0, which is very misleading. It should either return inf or NaN, to indicate that the EDM is invalid. Ideally, a proper EDM should be calculated for the obtained minimum after the scan.; - MnScan always builds a vector of all the (parameter, function value) pairs obtained during the scan, but that vector is discarded after the run.

Modifiability,"hnjo hm that's an interesting clue, but then I still don't fully understand why `RooFit::TestStatistics::RooUnbinnedL` would give a different answer, because it also just calls `RooAbsPdf::extendedTerm`, so it should still get the exact same result... Yes, you are absolutely right, I got carried away by finding the first / one of the differences by comparing x86 to mac13arm. Looking some more why `RooUnbinnedL` gives two different results on the same platform, it is actually closely related: in `RooUnbinnedL::evaluatePartition`, the `extendedTerm` is added to the first partition, if `events.begin_fraction == 0`. With one big partition, this is added at the very end, just before returning. For the sub event sections, it is added to the first partition and the other partitions are later added on top. This exhibits different rounding, which is *triggered* by mac13arm using the FMA instructions and having a different `extendedTerm` than x86. One solution to this would be to add the `extendedTerm` to the last partition, that is if `events.end_fraction == 1`. This fixes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` on `mac13arm`, but makes it fail on x86 (didn't investigate why). It also makes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fail (both on `mac13arm` and x86) - this test looks even worse in terms of floating point arithmetic, since it expects summing up two partitions individually and then adding the result being bitwise identical to summing up the whole range at once. From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. > Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. See above; the additional problem is that the (optimizing) compiler will insert FMA operations if it sees fit (and is allowed to do so).

Modifiability,"htlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example.

Please ignore this. The issue seems to be caused by the plugin manager which is trying to resolve a url. The crash is still present for `root.exe -l -b -e 'gSystem->AccessPathName(""httppp://KKKKK"",kFileExists)'` which just goes over the available plugins and asks if one could resolve the url. The current flow is that we first parse the string `gSystem->AccessPathName(""httppp://KKKKK"",kFileExists)` and start executing it. Then, at execution time, we realize that might be a url and start parsing and executing various file fetch plugins (davix, http...) and then upon execution of `etc/plugins/TSystem/P050_TWebSystem.C` we crash. The code of the plugin is nothing complicated:; ```c++; void P050_TWebSystem(); {; gPluginMgr->AddHandler(""TSystem"", ""^http:"", ""TWebSystem"",; ""Net"", ""TWebSystem()"");; }; ```. Oddly, removing the backslashes makes the crash disappear: `gSystem->AccessPathName(""httppp:KKKKK"",kFileExists)`.

Modifiability,"ill create conflicts when backporting changes across this commit. Could we have a discussion on the benefit/cost ratio?. Well, that raises an even more general question: if there is little commitment to touch/refactor/maintain old code, what is your long term strategy for these parts of ROOT then? Will these old codes be deprecated/removed then? Code rot is a fact and it gets only worse over time. And so far I have the feeling ROOT will still be there in the next decade or the one after. And if these codes stay around than they should be maintained and improved occasionally. Of course maintenance takes resources. And I know that nobody ever has time to do it. But leaving everything as is in the face of possible improvements also has a cost that we pay be doing nothing. For this particular PR, if I jump into a header file, I do not know which methods are overriding something from a base class. But this knowledge helps me when reading new code. Now I pay the cost for having to look this information up in the inheritance hierarchy. In recent years we are lucky enough to even have automatic refactoring tools. They are far from perfect. But they are good. And applying them has very little cost for a moderate benefit. So I think at least those automatic refactorings should be applied to old code. Regular manual refactoring of production code would be even better, but I know I live in a dream world here ;). There is also the broken window theory, stating that code with bad quality encourages people working on it to also tolerate new code to be bad. I just started here in ROOT and I already heard from a few people that ROOT code is bad and I should have low expectations. So if we would improve the old code just a little we could also improve this mindset by a bit 👍 . So please consider to apply at least automatic refactorings!. > We cannot merge this as is. @bernhardmgruber what do you want to do with this? Can we close this, discuss, and then do what we converged on?

Modifiability,"ing it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_type""); ```. That leak occurs when `findScope` in the LookupHelper starts parsing whenever `quickFindDecl()` fails (it's nothing to do with `mpz_class` or `ClassInfo_IsEnum` per se, just that that's where it was first found). If `quickFindDecl()` succeeds, then no leak. Since this is an accumulation of internal state, it will _not_ be reported by valgrind as a leak. Use of `findScope` is pervasive, not just from Python, but also from I/O and in clingutils. So, you're sitting on a leak even in HEP (where, especially in the LHC experiments, memory is precious), but your standard test tools won't catch it. To discover these types of deep problems, you need portable software, as that allows it to be used by a wider audience, causing it to be better tested simply through the virtue of having more eyes on it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:4600,portab,portable,4600,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,1,['portab'],['portable']

In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine.

Modifiability,"is clear) were written to the most recently opened file, not to those with which they were initialized. In the link above, I found the way to solve this:. TFile.Write(). would save its objects. I find this very non-straightforward. I think that if a file is associated with TTree, it should be written to that file. On the line 891 of [TTree.cxx](https://root.cern/doc/master/TTree_8cxx_source.html) there is a fixme comment:. > // Insert ourself into the current directory.; // FIXME: This is very annoying behaviour, we should; // be able to choose to not do this like we; // can with a histogram. That comment was misleading for me, I thought that was not implemented and was looking for hackish ways not to do that. ### Optional: share how it could be improved; I see several ways how it could be improved:. 1) make Write use TTree's file if that was set in the constructor. This is natural and doesn't contradict inheritance from TObject, because a) not all ROOT objects belong to the global directory b) virtual functions can be reimplemented in daughter classes; this is fine when the general behaviour is the same.; 2) add to TTree:Write documentation the way to write to a given file instead of the current file (this might be easier to find and understand than in the vast docs of TTree).; 3) maybe create a method Write(file) of TTree with an argument TFile/(its parent). In the [program of work for 2020](https://indico.cern.ch/event/875784/contributions/3690258/attachments/1975740/3288395/ROOT-PoW2020-EP-SFT.pdf) on page 10 Axel Naumann proposes: ""Keep interfaces readable for current ROOT users. canv->cd(); hist->Draw(); becomes canv->Draw(hist)."" I think this is very much in line with this suggestion, and it's just a good design. ### Setup; 1. ROOT 6.22/06. ### Additional context; I found a question [TTree.Write() vs. TFile.Write()](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/ttree-write-vs-tfile-write/82) on the Forum, so it may be better to explain (or implement) it more explicitly in doc",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7308:2102,inherit,inheritance,2102,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7308,1,['inherit'],['inheritance']

Modifiability,"iscussion on the benefit/cost ratio?. Well, that raises an even more general question: if there is little commitment to touch/refactor/maintain old code, what is your long term strategy for these parts of ROOT then? Will these old codes be deprecated/removed then? Code rot is a fact and it gets only worse over time. And so far I have the feeling ROOT will still be there in the next decade or the one after. And if these codes stay around than they should be maintained and improved occasionally. Of course maintenance takes resources. And I know that nobody ever has time to do it. But leaving everything as is in the face of possible improvements also has a cost that we pay be doing nothing. For this particular PR, if I jump into a header file, I do not know which methods are overriding something from a base class. But this knowledge helps me when reading new code. Now I pay the cost for having to look this information up in the inheritance hierarchy. In recent years we are lucky enough to even have automatic refactoring tools. They are far from perfect. But they are good. And applying them has very little cost for a moderate benefit. So I think at least those automatic refactorings should be applied to old code. Regular manual refactoring of production code would be even better, but I know I live in a dream world here ;). There is also the broken window theory, stating that code with bad quality encourages people working on it to also tolerate new code to be bad. I just started here in ROOT and I already heard from a few people that ROOT code is bad and I should have low expectations. So if we would improve the old code just a little we could also improve this mindset by a bit 👍 . So please consider to apply at least automatic refactorings!. > We cannot merge this as is. @bernhardmgruber what do you want to do with this?

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug; <!--; A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is.; -->; When passing a argument to a formula based RooFit function (e.g. `RooFormulaVar` or `RooGenericPdf`), RooFit will search for all occurrences of the object name in the formula and replace them with an ordinal parameter (needed for the underling `TFormula`). However, when the argument is a `RooConst` the name is just a string containing the value and this can break if there are numeric literals inside the formula.; For example; ```; RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.)); ```; becomes inside the `TFormula`; ```; x[0].7*x[0]; ```; because the name 2 of the `RooConst` matched the 2 of the numeric literal. This of course breaks during formula compilation. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; The variables do not replace numeric literals no matter the name. Possibly `RooConst`s should be matched only by index?. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

Modifiability,"ity issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_type""); ```. That leak occurs when `findScope` in the LookupHelper starts parsing whenever `quickFindDecl()` fails (it's nothing to do with `mpz_class` or `ClassInfo_IsEnum` per se, just that that's where it was first found). If `quickFindDecl()` succeeds, then no leak.

Modifiability,"jblomer , we are trying to test latest root master changes in [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/8973) and our build failed with errors like [a]. Looks like this change is causing cmssw to fail. I guess we need to update cmssw to use `model.GetDefaultEntry()->GetPtr<T>(name)` instead of `model.Get<T>(name)` ... right? What about `addField<T>()` calls?. We also want same cmssw code to work for ROOT 6.26 and above. So should we add some `#if ROOT_VERSION_CODE >= ROOT_VERSION(6,31,0)` blocks ?.
