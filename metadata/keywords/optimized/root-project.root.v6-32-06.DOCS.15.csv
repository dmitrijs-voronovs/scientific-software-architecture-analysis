It is; the base class for a series of subclasses, one for each of the; available field types. The ``RecTy`` class has one data member that is an; enumerated type specifying the specific type of field value. (A better; name for this class might be ``FieldTy``.). The ``RecTy`` class provides a few useful functions. * A virtual function to get the type name as a string. * A virtual function to check whether all the values of this type can; be converted to another given type. * A virtual function to check whether this type is a subtype of; another given type. * A function to get the corresponding ``list``; type for lists with elements of this type. For example, the function; returns the ``list<int>`` type when called with the ``int`` type. The subclasses that inherit from ``RecTy`` are; ``BitRecTy``,; ``BitsRecTy``,; ``CodeRecTy``,; ``DagRecTy``,; ``IntRecTy``,; ``ListRecTy``,; ``RecordRecTy``, and; ``StringRecTy``.; Some of these classes have additional members that; are described in the following subsections. *All* of the classes derived from ``RecTy`` provide the ``get()`` function.; It returns an instance of ``Recty`` corresponding to the derived class.; Some of the ``get()`` functions require an argument to; specify which particular variant of the type is desired. These arguments are; described in the following subsections. A ``RecTy`` instance can be printed to an output stream with the ``<<``; operator. .. warning::; It is not specified whether there is a single ``RecTy`` instance of a; particular type or multiple instances. ``BitsRecTy``; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~. This class includes a data member with the size of the ``bits`` value and a; function to get that size.

Modifiability,"lang with PGO; =======================. If you prefer to not use the script or the cmake cache, this briefly goes over; how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO. First, you should have at least LLVM, Clang, and compiler-rt checked out; locally. Next, at a high level, you're going to need to do the following:. 1. Build a standard Release Clang and the relevant libclang_rt.profile library; 2. Build Clang using the Clang you built above, but with instrumentation; 3. Use the instrumented Clang to generate profiles, which consists of two steps:. - Running the instrumented Clang/LLVM/lld/etc. on tasks that represent how; users will use said tools.; - Using a tool to convert the ""raw"" profiles generated above into a single,; final PGO profile. 4. Build a final release Clang (along with whatever other binaries you need); using the profile collected from your benchmark. In more detailed steps:. 1. Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires). 3. As mentioned above, this has two steps: gathering profile data, and then; massaging it into a useful form:. a. Build your benchmark using the Clang generated in step 2.

In addition to rules, the refactoring action; provides the action's command name and description to ``clang-refactor``.; Each action must implement the ``RefactoringAction`` interface.

StringRef getDescription() const override {; return ""Finds and renames symbols in code with no indexer support"";; }. RefactoringActionRules createActionRules() const override {; ...; }; };. Refactoring Action Rules; ------------------------. An individual refactoring action is responsible for creating the set of; grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.; Although the rules in one action may have a number of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result. It should be easy for users to; identify which refactoring action produced the result regardless of which; refactoring action rule was used. The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of actions; that define a set of different rules that produce similar results. For example,; the ""add missing switch cases"" refactoring operation typically adds missing; cases to one switch at a time. However, it could be useful to have a; refactoring that works on all switches that operate on a particular enum, as; one could then automatically update all of them after adding a new enum; constant. To achieve that, we can create two different rules that will use one; ``clang-refactor`` subcommand. The first rule will describe a local operation; that's initiated when the user selects a single switch. The second rule will; describe a global operation that works across translation units and is initiated; when the user provides the name of the enum to clang-refactor (or the user could; select the enum declaration instead).

Modifiability,"lation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them to the multilib system.; To see what flags are emitted for a given set of command line options, use; the ``-print-multi-flags-experimental`` command line option; along with the rest of the options you want to use.; #. Load ``multilib.yaml`` from sysroot.; #. Generate additional flags. ``multilib.yaml`` contains a ``Mappings`` section,; which specifies how to generate additional flags based on the flags derived; from command line options. Flags are matched using regular expressions.; These regular expressions shall use the POSIX extended regular expression; syntax.; #. Match flags against multilib variants. If the generated flags are a superset; of the flags specified for a multilib variant then the variant is considered; a match.; If more than one variant matches then a toolchain may opt to either use only; the *last* matching multilib variant, or may use all matching variants,; thereby :ref:`layering<multilib-layering>` them.; #. Generate ``-isystem`` and ``-L`` options. Iterate in reverse order over; the matching multilib variants, and generate ``-isystem`` and ``-L``; options based on the multilib variant's directory. .. _multilib-layering:. Multilib layering; =================. When Clang selects multilib variants, it may find that more than one variant; matches. It is up to the ToolChain subclass to decide what to do in this case.; There are two options permitted:. #. Use only the *last* matching multilib variant. This option exists primarily; for compatibility with the previous multilib design.; #",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst:3223,extend,extended,3223,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,1,['extend'],['extended']
Modifiability,"lation tool using Clang Transformer. .. contents::; :local:. What is Clang Transformer?; --------------------------. Clang Transformer is a framework for writing C++ diagnostics and program; transformations. It is built on the clang toolchain and the LibTooling library,; but aims to hide much of the complexity of clang's native, low-level libraries. The core abstraction of Transformer is the *rewrite rule*, which specifies how; to change a given program pattern into a new form. Here are some examples of; tasks you can achieve with Transformer:. * warn against using the name ``MkX`` for a declared function,; * change ``MkX`` to ``MakeX``, where ``MkX`` is the name of a declared function,; * change ``s.size()`` to ``Size(s)``, where ``s`` is a ``string``,; * collapse ``e.child().m()`` to ``e.m()``, for any expression ``e`` and method named; ``m``. All of the examples have a common form: they identify a pattern that is the; target of the transformation, they specify an *edit* to the code identified by; the pattern, and their pattern and edit refer to common variables, like ``s``,; ``e``, and ``m``, that range over code fragments. Our first and second examples also; specify constraints on the pattern that aren't apparent from the syntax alone,; like ""``s`` is a ``string``."" Even the first example (""warn ..."") shares this form,; even though it doesn't change any of the code -- it's ""edit"" is simply a no-op. Transformer helps users succinctly specify rules of this sort and easily execute; them locally over a collection of files, apply them to selected portions of; a codebase, or even bundle them as a clang-tidy check for ongoing application. Who is Clang Transformer for?; -----------------------------. Clang Transformer is for developers who want to write clang-tidy checks or write; tools to modify a large number of C++ files in (roughly) the same way. What; qualifies as ""large"" really depends on the nature of the change and your; patience for repetitive editing.

In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and; fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call; to fit the histogram, the ""fitter"" will dynamically load libMinuit if; it is not yet loaded. #### Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking. plugin manager The Plugin Manager **`TPluginManager`** allows; postponing library dependencies to runtime: a plugin library will only; be loaded when it is needed. Non-plugins will need to be linked, and; are thus loaded at start-up. Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them.

Data members that are references (as; `MyClass &fObj;`) are never saved, it is always the responsibility of; the object's constructor to set them properly. ### Automatically Generated Streamers. A `Streamer `usually calls other `Streamers`: the `Streamer `of its; parents and data members. This architecture depends on all classes; having `Streamers`, because eventually they will be called. To ensure; that a class has a `Streamer`, `rootcling` automatically creates one in; the `ClassDef` macro that is defined in `$ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h`.; `ClassDef` defines several methods for any class, and one of them is the; `Streamer`. The automatically generated `Streamer `is complete and can; be used as long as no customization is needed. The `Event` class is defined in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.h`. Looking at the; class definition, we find that it inherits from **`TObject`**. It is a; simple example of a class with diverse data members. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; TDirectory *fTransient; //! current directory; Float_t fPt; //! transient value; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr; //|| don't split; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; ...; ```.

What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++; compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is; very hard to do in a performance-portable way. In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization; paths, which drives its performance.; For example, basic inheritance sequentially lines up classes, whereas; multiple (virtual) inheritance usually requires thunks.; Thus, when calling base class methods on a derived instance, the latter; requires offset calculations that depend on that instance, whereas the former; has fixed offsets fully determined by the class definitions themselves.; By labeling classes appropriately, single inheritance classes (by far the; most common case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:2662,portab,portable,2662,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['portab'],['portable']

If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one.

RefactoringActionRules Rules;; Rules.push_back(; createRefactoringActionRule<DeleteSelectedRange>(; SourceRangeSelectionRequirement()); );. The ``createRefactoringActionRule`` function takes in a list of refactoring; action rule requirement values.

Refactoring Action Rule Requirements; ------------------------------------. A refactoring action rule requirement is a value whose type derives from the; ``RefactoringActionRuleRequirement`` class. The type must define an; ``evaluate`` member function that returns a value of type ``Expected<...>``.; When a requirement value is used as an argument to; ``createRefactoringActionRule``, that value is evaluated during the initiation; of the action rule. The evaluated result is then passed to the rule's; constructor unless the evaluation produced an error. For example, the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` sample rule that's defined in the previous section; will be evaluated using the following steps:. #. ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement``'s ``evaluate`` member function will be; called first. It will return an ``Expected<SourceRange>``. #. If the return value is an error the initiation will fail and the error; will be reported to the client. Note that the client may not report the; error to the user. #. Otherwise the source range return value will be used to construct the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` rule.

When a class contains text or derives from a text class, it needs to be; able to set text attributes like font type, size, and color. To do so,; the class inherits from the **`TAttText`** class (a secondary; inheritance), which defines text attributes. **`TLatex`** and; **`TText`** inherit from **`TAttText`**. #### Setting Text Alignment. Text alignment may be set by a method call. What is said here applies to; all objects deriving from **`TAttText`**, and there are many. We will; take an example that may be transposed to other types. Suppose ""`la`"" is; a **`TLatex`** object. The alignment is set with:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] la->SetTextAlign(align); ```. The parameter `align` is a `short` describing the alignment:. `align = 10*HorizontalAlign + VerticalAlign`. For horizontal alignment, the following convention applies:. - 1 = left. - 2 = centered. - 3 = right. For vertical alignment, the following convention applies:. - 1 = bottom. - 2 = centered. - 3 = top. For example, align: 11 = left adjusted and bottom adjusted; 32 = right; adjusted and vertically centered. #### Setting Text Angle. Use `TAttText::SetTextAngle` to set the text angle. The `angle` is the; degrees of the horizontal. ``` {.cpp}; root[] la->SetTextAngle(angle); ```. #### Setting Text Color.

Variables can also be substituted later on the; same line they were defined on. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: op [[REG:r[0-9]+]], [[REG]]. Can be useful if you want the operands of ``op`` to be the same register,; and don't care exactly which register it is. If ``--enable-var-scope`` is in effect, variables with names that; start with ``$`` are considered to be global. All others variables are; local. All local variables get undefined at the beginning of each; CHECK-LABEL block. Global variables are not affected by CHECK-LABEL.; This makes it easier to ensure that individual tests are not affected; by variables set in preceding tests. FileCheck Numeric Substitution Blocks; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. :program:`FileCheck` also supports numeric substitution blocks that allow; defining numeric variables and checking for numeric values that satisfy a; numeric expression constraint based on those variables via a numeric; substitution. This allows ``CHECK:`` directives to verify a numeric relation; between two numbers, such as the need for consecutive registers to be used. The syntax to capture a numeric value is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>:]]`` where:. * ``%<fmtspec>,`` is an optional format specifier to indicate what number; format to match and the minimum number of digits to expect. * ``<NUMVAR>:`` is an optional definition of variable ``<NUMVAR>`` from the; captured value. The syntax of ``<fmtspec>`` is: ``#.<precision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:28027,variab,variables,28027,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,2,['variab'],['variables']

In the standard asan runtime, these; functions are weak symbols, i.e. one can just override them with the desired configuration. That's what's happening here. This can be achieved in two ways:; 1. `LD_PRELOAD`: A micro library `libROOTSanitizerConfig.<dylib|so>` is created with the setup in this folder, and can be found in `<builddir>/lib/`.; Loading it with `LD_PRELOAD` will bring ROOT's default sanitiser config into any non-sanitised executable, e.g. python.; 2. ROOT executables will get the config automatically, using a static version of the config library, `libROOTStaticSanitizerConfig.a`.; All ROOT executables statically link against it, so they start up without reporting lots of unfixable memory leaks (e.g. llvm). #### Small linker magic to get the config symbols into ROOT's executables; When linking a ROOT executable, the setup functions from the sanitiser config library might get ignored, because they are not used in any of our executables.; In `cmake/modules/SetUp{Linux|MacOS}.cmake`, the functions are therefore marked as ""undefined"" for the linker, so it starts copying; them into all ROOT executables.; This way, root.exe, cling, ... can start up with a sane default config. ### Use your own address/leak sanitizer configuration; The default configurations can be overridden using the environment variables `ASAN_OPTIONS` and `LSAN_OPTIONS`. Refer to the; [address sanitizer documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or use `ASAN_OPTIONS=help=1` when starting; up a sanitised executable (e.g. `root.exe`). A template for a leak suppression file can be found in `$ROOTSYS/etc/lsan-root.supp`. ## Create your own sanitised executable; ROOT exports a library target called `ROOT::ROOTStaticSanitizerConfig` that can be used to create sanitised executables with ROOT's default; address sani",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md:1207,config,config,1207,core/sanitizer/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md,2,['config'],['config']

The compiler runtime library provides definitions of functions implicitly; invoked by the compiler to support operations not natively supported by; the underlying hardware (for instance, 128-bit integer multiplications),; and where inline expansion of the operation is deemed unsuitable. The default runtime library is target-specific. For targets where GCC is; the dominant compiler, Clang currently defaults to using libgcc_s. On most; other targets, compiler-rt is used by default. compiler-rt (LLVM); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. `LLVM's compiler runtime library <https://compiler-rt.llvm.org/>`_ provides a; complete set of runtime library functions containing all functions that; Clang will implicitly call, in ``libclang_rt.builtins.<arch>.a``. You can instruct Clang to use compiler-rt with the ``--rtlib=compiler-rt`` flag.; This is not supported on every platform. If using libc++ and/or libc++abi, you may need to configure them to use; compiler-rt rather than libgcc_s by passing ``-DLIBCXX_USE_COMPILER_RT=YES``; and/or ``-DLIBCXXABI_USE_COMPILER_RT=YES`` to ``cmake``. Otherwise, you; may end up with both runtime libraries linked into your program (this is; typically harmless, but wasteful). libgcc_s (GNU); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. `GCC's runtime library <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html>`_; can be used in place of compiler-rt. However, it lacks several functions; that LLVM may emit references to, particularly when using Clang's; ``__builtin_*_overflow`` family of intrinsics. You can instruct Clang to use libgcc_s with the ``--rtlib=libgcc`` flag.; This is not supported on every platform. Atomics library; ---------------. If your program makes use of atomic operations and the compiler is not able; to lower them all directly to machine instructions (because there either is; no known suitable machine instruction or the operand is not known to be; suitably aligned), a call to a runtime library ``__atomic_*`` function; will be generated.

It also adds the; classes and functions declared in included files with the same name; as the script file and any of the following extensions: `.h`, `.hh`,; `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.hPP`, `.hXX`. This means that, by default, you; cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using; `#include` statements; you will need to compile each script; separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables; declared in the script to the dictionary also.

If you need to keep the intermediate; files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use; gDebug=7. ### Moving between Interpreter and Compiler. The best way to develop portable scripts is to make sure you can; always run them with both, the interpreter and with ACLiC. To do so,; do not use the Cling extensions and program around the Cling; limitations. When it is not possible or desirable to program around; the Cling limitations, you can use the C preprocessor symbols defined; for Cling and `rootcling`. The preprocessor symbol `__CLING__` is defined for both ROOT and; `rootcling`. The symbol `__ROOTCLING__` (and `__MAKECINT__` for backward; compatibility) is only defined in `rootcling`. Use `!defined(__CLING__) || defined(__ROOTCLING__)` to bracket code that; needs to be seen by the compiler and `rootcling`, but will be invisible; to the interpreter. Use `!defined(__CLING__) `to bracket code that should be seen only by; the compiler and not by Cling nor `rootcling. `For example, the following; will hide the declaration and initialization of the array `gArray`; from both Cling and `rootcling`. ``` {.cpp}; #if !defined(__CLING__); int gArray[] = { 2, 3, 4};; #endif; ```.

Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash. Here is example of a; configuration file:. ::. # Several options on line; -c --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. # Long option split between lines; -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/../../../../\; include/c++/5.4.0. # other config files may be included; @linux.options.

For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

It; also doesn't apply to inline members with static local variables, to ensure; that the same instance of the variable is used inside and outside the DLL. Using this flag can cause problems when inline functions that would otherwise; be dllexported refer to internal symbols of a DLL. For example:. .. code-block:: c. void internal();. struct __declspec(dllimport) S {; void foo() { internal(); }; }. Normally, references to `S::foo()` would use the definition in the DLL from; which it was exported, and which presumably also has the definition of; `internal()`. However, when using ``/Zc:dllexportInlines-``, the inline; definition of `S::foo()` is used directly, resulting in a link error since; `internal()` is not available. Even worse, if there is an inline definition of; `internal()` containing a static local variable, we will now refer to a; different instance of that variable than in the DLL:. .. code-block:: c. inline int internal() { static int x; return x++; }. struct __declspec(dllimport) S {; int foo() { return internal(); }; }. This could lead to very subtle bugs. Using ``-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`` can; lead to the same issue.

There is a minimal UBSan runtime available suitable for use in production; environments. This runtime has a small attack surface. It only provides very; basic issue logging and deduplication, and does not support ``-fsanitize=vptr``; checking. To use the minimal runtime, add ``-fsanitize-minimal-runtime`` to the clang; command line options. For example, if you're used to compiling with; ``-fsanitize=undefined``, you could enable the minimal runtime with; ``-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-minimal-runtime``. Stack traces and report symbolization; =====================================; If you want UBSan to print symbolized stack trace for each error report, you; will need to:. #. Compile with ``-g`` and ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer`` to get proper debug; information in your binary.; #. Run your program with environment variable; ``UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1``.; #.

ACLiC executes two steps and a third one if needed. These are:. - Calling `rootcling` to create a dictionary using `rootcling`.; - Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; - If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy; executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the; classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the; classes and functions declared in included files with the same name; as the script file and any of the following extensions: `.h`, `.hh`,; `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.hPP`, `.hXX`. This means that, by default, you; cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using; `#include` statements; you will need to compile each script; separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables; declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious; about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3; and ACLiC will print these steps. If you need to keep the intermediate; files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use; gDebug=7. ### Moving between Interpreter and Compiler. The best way to develop portable scripts is to make sure you can; always run them with both, the interpreter and with ACLiC. To do so,; do not use the Cling extensions and program around the Cling; limitations. When it is not possible or desirable to program around; the Cling limitations, you can use the C preprocessor symbols defined; for Cling and `rootcling`. The preprocessor symbol `__CLING__` is defined for both ROOT and; `rootcling`. The symbol `__ROOTCLING__` (and `__MAKECINT__` for backward; compatibility) is only defined in `rootcling`.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See; :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a; subset of the options specified on the command line, see; :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after; parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for; supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`; by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as; inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

For this purpose we can use lattice in a form of a mapping from variable; declarations to initialization states; each initialization state is represented; by the following lattice:. ![Lattice for definitive initialization analysis](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/DefinitiveInitializationLattice.svg). A lattice element could also capture the source locations of the branches that; lead us to the corresponding program point. Diagnostics would use this; information to show a sample buggy code path to the user. ## Example: refactoring raw pointers to `unique_ptr`. Modern idiomatic C++ uses smart pointers to express memory ownership, however in; pre-C++11 code one can often find raw pointers that own heap memory blocks. Imagine that we would like to refactor raw pointers that own memory to; `unique_ptr`. There are multiple ways to design a data flow analysis for this; problem; let's look at one way to do it. For example, we would like to refactor the following code that uses raw; pointers:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi = new int;; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; delete pi;; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi);; }; }; ```. into code that uses `unique_ptr`:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; auto pi = std::make_unique<int>();; if (...) {; Borrow(pi.get());; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi.release());; }; }; ```. This problem can be solved with a lattice in form of map from value declarations; to pointer states:. ![Lattice that identifies candidates for unique_ptr refactoring](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/UniquePtrLattice.svg). We can perform the refactoring if at the exit of a function `pi` is; `Compatible`. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi; // pi is Compatible; pi = new int; // pi is Defined; if (...) {; Borrow(pi); // pi is Defined; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi); // pi is Compatible; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```.

The CMake language provides control flow constructs in the form of foreach loops; and if blocks. To make the example above more complicated you could add an if; block to define ""APPLE"" when targeting Apple platforms:. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(HelloWorld); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp); if(APPLE); target_compile_definitions(HelloWorld PUBLIC APPLE); endif(). Variables, Types, and Scope; ===========================. Dereferencing; -------------. In CMake variables are ""stringly"" typed. All variables are represented as; strings throughout evaluation. Wrapping a variable in ``${}`` dereferences it; and results in a literal substitution of the name for the value. CMake refers to; this as ""variable evaluation"" in their documentation. Dereferences are performed; *before* the command being called receives the arguments. This means; dereferencing a list results in multiple separate arguments being passed to the; command. Variable dereferences can be nested and be used to model complex data. For; example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(var_name var1); set(${var_name} foo) # same as ""set(var1 foo)""; set(${${var_name}}_var bar) # same as ""set(foo_var bar)"". Dereferencing an unset variable results in an empty expansion. It is a common; pattern in CMake to conditionally set variables knowing that it will be used in; code paths that the variable isn't set. There are examples of this throughout; the LLVM CMake build system. An example of variable empty expansion is:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(APPLE); set(extra_sources Apple.cpp); endif(); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp ${extra_sources}).

It is not an error if either of these files is not found. The configuration file consists of command-line options specified on one or; more lines. Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash. Here is example of a; configuration file:. ::. # Several options on line; -c --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. # Long option split between lines; -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/../../../../\; include/c++/5.4.0. # other config files may be included; @linux.options. Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

When deciding between creating a type hierarchy (with either tagged or virtual; dispatch) and using templates or concepts-based polymorphism, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code. We have also found that a large; amount of our usage of type hierarchies fits better with tag-based pattern; matching rather than dynamic dispatch across a common interface. Within LLVM we; have built custom helpers to facilitate this design.

Modifiability,"ller raw profile size, and; better runtime performance. Frontend-based instrumentation, on the other hand,; has better source correlation, so it should be used with source line-based; coverage testing. The flag ``-fcs-profile-generate`` also instruments programs using the same; instrumentation method as ``-fprofile-generate``. However, it performs a; post-inline late instrumentation and can produce context-sensitive profiles. Here are the steps for using profile guided optimization with; instrumentation:. 1. Build an instrumented version of the code by compiling and linking with the; ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` option. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -fprofile-instr-generate code.cc -o code. 2. Run the instrumented executable with inputs that reflect the typical usage.; By default, the profile data will be written to a ``default.profraw`` file; in the current directory. You can override that default by using option; ``-fprofile-instr-generate=`` or by setting the ``LLVM_PROFILE_FILE``; environment variable to specify an alternate file. If non-default file name; is specified by both the environment variable and the command line option,; the environment variable takes precedence. The file name pattern specified; can include different modifiers: ``%p``, ``%h``, ``%m``, ``%t``, and ``%c``. Any instance of ``%p`` in that file name will be replaced by the process; ID, so that you can easily distinguish the profile output from multiple; runs. .. code-block:: console. $ LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=""code-%p.profraw"" ./code. The modifier ``%h`` can be used in scenarios where the same instrumented; binary is run in multiple different host machines dumping profile data; to a shared network based storage. The ``%h`` specifier will be substituted; with the hostname so that profiles collected from different hosts do not; clobber each other. While the use of ``%p`` specifier can reduce the likelihood for the profiles; dumped from different processes to clobbe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:103942,variab,variable,103942,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

This funny looking code creates an IRBuilder object that is pointing at; the first instruction (.begin()) of the entry block. It then creates an; alloca with the expected name and returns it.

The goal is to make it a drop-in replacement for; GNU's :program:`addr2line`. Here are some of those differences:. - ``llvm-addr2line`` interprets all addresses as hexadecimal and ignores an; optional ``0x`` prefix, whereas ``llvm-symbolizer`` attempts to determine; the base from the literal's prefix and defaults to decimal if there is no; prefix. - ``llvm-addr2line`` defaults not to print function names. Use `-f`_ to enable; that. - ``llvm-addr2line`` defaults not to demangle function names. Use `-C`_ to; switch the demangling on. - ``llvm-addr2line`` defaults not to print inlined frames. Use `-i`_ to show; inlined frames for a source code location in an inlined function. - ``llvm-addr2line`` uses `--output-style=GNU`_ by default. - ``llvm-addr2line`` parses options from the environment variable; ``LLVM_ADDR2LINE_OPTS`` instead of from ``LLVM_SYMBOLIZER_OPTS``.

This isn’t perfect, as stores may have; been moved, modified or deleted before inlining, but it does at least keep the; information about the variable correct within the non-inlined scope. **Splitting** stores: SROA and passes that split stores treat `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics similarly to `llvm.dbg.declare` intrinsics. Clone the; `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics linked to the store, update the FragmentInfo in; the `ValueExpression`, and give the split stores (and cloned intrinsics) new; `DIAssignID` attachments each. In other words, treat the split stores as; separate assignments.

Classes are simply; abstract records and so go through the same steps. 1. Build the record name (:token:`NameValue`) and create an empty record. 2. Parse the parent classes in the :token:`ParentClassList` from left to; right, visiting each parent class's ancestor classes from top to bottom. a. Add the fields from the parent class to the record.; b. Substitute the template arguments into those fields.; c. Add the parent class to the record's list of inherited classes. 3. Apply any top-level ``let`` bindings to the record. Recall that top-level; bindings only apply to inherited fields. 4. Parse the body of the record. * Add any fields to the record.; * Modify the values of fields according to local ``let`` statements.; * Define any ``defvar`` variables. 5. Make a pass over all the fields to resolve any inter-field references. 6. Add the record to the final record list.

The clang-refactor tool will then analyze; the selection and other options passed to the refactoring action, and will pick; the most appropriate rule for the given selection and other options. Rule Types; ^^^^^^^^^^. Clang's refactoring engine supports several different refactoring rules:. - ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` produces source replacements that are applied; to the source files. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to; implement the ``createSourceReplacements`` member function. This type of; rule is typically used to implement local refactorings that transform the; source in one translation unit only. - ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` produces a ""partial"" refactoring; result: a set of occurrences that refer to a particular symbol. This type; of rule is typically used to implement an interactive renaming action that; allows users to specify which occurrences should be renamed during the; refactoring. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to implement; the ``findSymbolOccurrences`` member function. The following set of quick checks might help if you are unsure about the type; of rule you should use:. #. If you would like to transform the source in one translation unit and if; you don't need any cross-TU information, then the; ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` should work for you. #. If you would like to implement a rename-like operation with potential; interactive components, then ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` might; work for you.

But this is not attractive as if the attribute is for a variable that; happens to end with a non-singleton stack, it will not simply put a; location description on the stack. Presumably the intent of using; ``DW_OP_call*`` on a variable or formal parameter debugger information; entry is to push just one location description on the stack. That; location description may have more than one single location description. The previous rule for ``exprloc`` also has the same problem, as normally; a variable or formal parameter location expression may leave multiple; entries on the stack and only return the top entry. GDB implements ``DW_OP_call*`` by always executing E on the same stack.; If the location list has multiple matching entries, it simply picks the; first one and ignores the rest. This seems fundamentally at odds with; the desire to support multiple places for variables. So, it feels like ``DW_OP_call*`` should both support pushing a location; description on the stack for a variable or formal parameter, and also; support being able to execute an operation expression on the same stack.; Being able to specify a different operation expression for different; program locations seems a desirable feature to retain. A solution to that is to have a distinct ``DW_AT_LLVM_proc`` attribute; for the ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure`` debugging information entry. Then the; ``DW_AT_location`` attribute expression is always executed separately; and pushes a location description (that may have multiple single; location descriptions), and the ``DW_AT_LLVM_proc`` attribute expression; is always executed on the same stack and can leave anything on the; stack.

The most interesting part of this is that we ignore top-level; semicolons. Why is this, you ask? The basic reason is that if you type; ""4 + 5"" at the command line, the parser doesn't know whether that is the; end of what you will type or not. For example, on the next line you; could type ""def foo..."" in which case 4+5 is the end of a top-level; expression. Alternatively you could type ""\* 6"", which would continue; the expression. Having top-level semicolons allows you to type ""4+5;"",; and the parser will know you are done. Conclusions; ===========. With just under 400 lines of commented code (240 lines of non-comment,; non-blank code), we fully defined our minimal language, including a; lexer, parser, and AST builder. With this done, the executable will; validate Kaleidoscope code and tell us if it is grammatically invalid.; For example, here is a sample interaction:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ./a.out; ready> def foo(x y) x+foo(y, 4.0);; Parsed a function definition.; ready> def foo(x y) x+y y;; Parsed a function definition.; Parsed a top-level expr; ready> def foo(x y) x+y );; Parsed a function definition.; Error: unknown token when expecting an expression; ready> extern sin(a);; ready> Parsed an extern; ready> ^D; $. There is a lot of room for extension here. You can define new AST nodes,; extend the language in many ways, etc. In the `next; installment <LangImpl03.html>`_, we will describe how to generate LLVM; Intermediate Representation (IR) from the AST.

While the function remains in SSA form, virtual register `%2` is sufficient to; identify the value computed by the instruction -- however the function; eventually leaves SSA form, and register optimisations will obscure which; register the desired value is in. Instead, a more consistent way of identifying; the instruction's value is to refer to the `MachineOperand` where the value is; defined: independently of which register is defined by that `MachineOperand`. In; the code above, the `DBG_INSTR_REF` instruction refers to instruction number; one, operand zero, while the `ADD32rr` has a `debug-instr-number` attribute; attached indicating that it is instruction number one. De-coupling variable locations from registers avoids difficulties involving; register allocation and optimisation, but requires additional instrumentation; when the instructions are optimised instead.

The 'Value' object enables wrapping a memory region that comes from the; JIT, and bringing it back to the compiled code (and vice versa).; This is a very useful functionality when:. - connecting an interpreter to the compiled code, or; - connecting an interpreter in another language. For example, this feature helps transport values across boundaries. A notable; example is the cppyy project code makes use of this feature to enable running C++; within Python. It enables transporting values/information between C++; and Python. Note: `cppyy <https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/>`_ is an automatic, run-time,; Python-to-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++.; It uses LLVM along with a C++ interpreter (e.g., Cling) to enable features like; run-time instantiation of C++ templates, cross-inheritance, callbacks,; auto-casting, transparent use of smart pointers, etc. In a nutshell, this feature enables a new way of developing code, paving the; way for language interoperability and easier interactive programming. Implementation Details; ======================. Interpreter as a REPL vs. as a Library; --------------------------------------. 1 - If we're using the interpreter in interactive (REPL) mode, it will dump; the value (i.e., value printing). .. code-block:: console. if (LastValue.isValid()) {; if (!V) {; LastValue.dump();; LastValue.clear();; } else; *V = std::move(LastValue);; }. 2 - If we're using the interpreter as a library, then it will pass the value; to the user. Incremental AST Consumer; ------------------------.

Between runs, CMake preserves the values set for all options. CMake has the; following build types defined:. Debug. These builds are the default. The build system will compile the tools and; libraries unoptimized, with debugging information, and asserts enabled. Release. For these builds, the build system will compile the tools and libraries; with optimizations enabled and not generate debug info. CMakes default; optimization level is -O3. This can be configured by setting the; ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE`` variable on the CMake command line. RelWithDebInfo. These builds are useful when debugging. They generate optimized binaries with; debug information. CMakes default optimization level is -O2. This can be; configured by setting the ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO`` variable on the; CMake command line. Once you have LLVM configured, you can build it by entering the *OBJ_ROOT*; directory and issuing the following command:. .. code-block:: console. % make. If the build fails, please `check here`_ to see if you are using a version of; GCC that is known not to compile LLVM. If you have multiple processors in your machine, you may wish to use some of the; parallel build options provided by GNU Make. For example, you could use the; command:. .. code-block:: console. % make -j2. There are several special targets which are useful when working with the LLVM; source code:. ``make clean``.

This method takes two call sites (``CS1``; & ``CS2``), returns ``NoModRef`` if neither call writes to memory read or; written by the other, ``Ref`` if ``CS1`` reads memory written by ``CS2``,; ``Mod`` if ``CS1`` writes to memory read or written by ``CS2``, or ``ModRef`` if; ``CS1`` might read or write memory written to by ``CS2``. Note that this; relation is not commutative. Other useful ``AliasAnalysis`` methods; --------------------------------------. Several other tidbits of information are often collected by various alias; analysis implementations and can be put to good use by various clients. The ``getModRefInfoMask`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``getModRefInfoMask`` method returns a bound on Mod/Ref information for; the supplied pointer, based on knowledge about whether the pointer points to; globally-constant memory (for which it returns ``NoModRef``) or; locally-invariant memory (for which it returns ``Ref``). Globally-constant; memory includes functions, constant global variables, and the null pointer.; Locally-invariant memory is memory that we know is invariant for the lifetime; of its SSA value, but not necessarily for the life of the program: for example,; the memory pointed to by ``readonly`` ``noalias`` parameters is known-invariant; for the duration of the corresponding function call. Given Mod/Ref information; ``MRI`` for a memory location ``Loc``, ``MRI`` can be refined with a statement; like ``MRI &= AA.getModRefInfoMask(Loc);``. Another useful idiom is; ``isModSet(AA.getModRefInfoMask(Loc))``; this checks to see if the given; location can be modified at all. For convenience, there is also a method; ``pointsToConstantMemory(Loc)``; this is synonymous with; ``isNoModRef(AA.getModRefInfoMask(Loc))``. .. _never access memory or only read memory:.

To; achieve a better understanding of the widgets' properties they are; separated by their type and their inheritance. As all of them inherit; from **`TGObject`** and most from **`TGWidget`**, these base classes are; described first. ### TGObject. **`TGObject`** is the base class for all ROOT GUI classes. It inherits; from **`TObject`**. The two data members of this class contain important; information about X11/Win32 window identifier and the connection to the; host's graphics system. Every GUI element, which derives from; **`TGObject`** has access to the **`TGClient`** via the data member; `fClient` of **`TGObject. TGClient`** creates the connection with the; host's graphics system and sets up the complete graphics system for all; widgets. ### TGWidget. The widgets base class **`TGWidget`** is typically used as a mix-in; class via multiple inheritances. Its properties are available for all; deriving widgets: **`TGButton`**, **`TGComboBox`**, **`TGTab`**,; **`TGColorPalette`**, **`TGColorPick`**, **`TGDoubleSlider`**,; **`TGListTree`**, **`TGNumberEntry`**, **`TGScrollBar`**,; **`TGShutterItem`**, **`TGTextEntry`**, **`TGSlider`**, **`TGListBox`**,; **`TGView.`**. This class has four data members keeping information about the widget id; - important for event processing, the window which handles the widget's; events, the widget status flags and the assigned command (if there is; any). The general properties of **`TGWidget`** are specified by; `SetFlags(Int_t flags)` and `ClearFlags(Int_t flags)` methods. The; status flags are: `kWidgetWantFocus`, `kWidgetHasFocus`, and; `kWidgetIsEnabled`.

The final code handles various cleanups: now that we have the ""NextVar""; value, we can add the incoming value to the loop PHI node. After that,; we remove the loop variable from the symbol table, so that it isn't in; scope after the for loop. Finally, code generation of the for loop; always returns 0.0, so that is what we return from; ``ForExprAST::codegen()``. With this, we conclude the ""adding control flow to Kaleidoscope"" chapter; of the tutorial. In this chapter we added two control flow constructs,; and used them to motivate a couple of aspects of the LLVM IR that are; important for front-end implementors to know.

TEST DISCOVERY; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Once test suites are located, :program:`lit` recursively traverses the source; directory (following *test_source_root*) looking for tests. When :program:`lit`; enters a sub-directory, it first checks to see if a nested test suite is; defined in that directory. If so, it loads that test suite recursively,; otherwise it instantiates a local test config for the directory (see; :ref:`local-configuration-files`). Tests are identified by the test suite they are contained within, and the; relative path inside that suite. Note that the relative path may not refer to; an actual file on disk; some test formats (such as *GoogleTest*) define; ""virtual tests"" which have a path that contains both the path to the actual; test file and a subpath to identify the virtual test. .. _local-configuration-files:. LOCAL CONFIGURATION FILES; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. When :program:`lit` loads a subdirectory in a test suite, it instantiates a; local test configuration by cloning the configuration for the parent directory; --- the root of this configuration chain will always be a test suite. Once the; test configuration is cloned :program:`lit` checks for a *lit.local.cfg* file; in the subdirectory. If present, this file will be loaded and can be used to; specialize the configuration for each individual directory. This facility can; be used to define subdirectories of optional tests, or to change other; configuration parameters --- for example, to change the test format, or the; suffixes which identify test files.

[CernVM-FS](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) should be installed; on all machines as the preferred method for software distribution. > Configuration instructions for the latest CernVM-FS can be found; > [here](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/techinformation). A brief step-by-step procedure to install CernVM-FS is hereby described. - Download and install the latest stable version from; [here](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem): pick one which is; appropriate to your operating system. You need the `cvmfs` package,; you *don't* need the `cvmfs-devel` or `cvmfs-server` ones. - As root user, run:. # cvmfs_config setup. - Start the `autofs` service: how to to this depends on your operating; system. On Ubuntu using Upstart:. # restart autofs. On RHEL-based or older Ubuntus:. # service autofs restart. - Prepare a `/etc/cvmfs/default.local` file (create it if it does not; exists) with the following configuration bits:. ``` {.bash}; CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy-server.domain.ch:3128,DIRECT; CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=your-experiment.cern.ch,sft.cern.ch; CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=50000; ```. You need to properly specify your closest HTTP caching proxy:; separate many of them via commas. The last fallback value, `DIRECT`,; tells cvmfs to connect directly without using any proxy at all. Among the list of repositories (comma-separated), always specify; `sft.cern.ch` and the one containing the software to your experiment; (e.g., `cms.cern.ch`). The quota limit is, in Megabytes, the amount of local disk space to; use as cache. - Check the configuration and repositories with:. # cvmfs_config chksetup; OK; # cvmfs_config probe; Probing /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch... OK; Probing /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch... OK. > You might need special configurations for some custom software; > repositories! Special cases are not covered in this guide. ### Firewall configuration.

To add; library that should be used during linking of the shared library use; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->AddLinkedLibs(""-L/my/path -lanylib"");; ```. This is especially useful for static libraries. For shared ones you; can also simply load them before trying to compile the script:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->Load(""mydir/mylib"");; ```. ACLiC uses the directive `fMakeSharedLibs` to create the shared; library. If loading the shared library fails, it tries to output a; list of missing symbols by creating an executable (on some platforms; like OSF, this does not HAVE to be an executable) containing the; script. It uses the directive `fMakeExe` to do so. For both; directives, before passing them to `TSystem::Exec()`, it expands the; variables `$SourceFiles`, `$SharedLib`, `$LibName`, `$IncludePath`,; `$LinkedLibs`, `$ExeName `and` $ObjectFiles`. See `SetMakeSharedLib()`; for more information on those variables. When the file being passed to; ACLiC is on a read only file system, ACLiC warns the user and creates; the library in a temporary directory:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L readonly/t.C++; Warning in <ACLiC>: /scratch/aclic/subs/./readonly is not writable!; Warning in <ACLiC>: Output will be written to /tmp; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library; /tmp//scratch/aclic/subs/./readonly/t_C.so; ```.

Modifiability,"lvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```. The first three parameters look and behave like an `llvm.dbg.value`. `ID` is a; reference to a store (see next section). `Address` is the destination address; of the store and it is modified by `AddressExpression`. An empty/undef/poison; address means the address component has been killed (the memory address is no; longer a valid location). LLVM currently encodes variable fragment information; in `DIExpression`s, so as an implementation quirk the `FragmentInfo` for; `Variable` is contained within `ValueExpression` only. The formal LLVM-IR signature is:; ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata); ```. ### Instruction link: `DIAssignID`. `DIAssignID` metadata is the mechanism that is currently used to encode the; store<->marker link. The metadata node has no operands and all instances are; `distinct`; equality is checked for by comparing addresses. `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics use a `DIAssignID` metadata node instance as an; operand.

Language and Compiler Issues; ----------------------------. Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Compiler warnings are often useful and help improve the code. Those that are; not useful, can be often suppressed with a small code change. For example, an; assignment in the ``if`` condition is often a typo:. .. code-block:: c++. if (V = getValue()) {; ...; }. Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }. Write Portable Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In almost all cases, it is possible to write completely portable code. When; you need to rely on non-portable code, put it behind a well-defined and; well-documented interface. Do not use RTTI or Exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In an effort to reduce code and executable size, LLVM does not use exceptions; or RTTI (`runtime type information; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information>`_, for example,; ``dynamic_cast<>``). That said, LLVM does make extensive use of a hand-rolled form of RTTI that use; templates like :ref:`isa\<>, cast\<>, and dyn_cast\<> <isa>`.; This form of RTTI is opt-in and can be; :doc:`added to any class <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. Prefer C++-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When casting, use ``static_cast``, ``reinterpret_cast``, and ``const_cast``,; rather than C-style casts.

Modifiability,"ly a good idea if:. - you've landed 3-5 patches of larger scope than ""fix a typo"". - you'd be willing to review changes that are closely related to yours. - you'd like to keep contributing to LLVM. Getting commit access; ---------------------. LLVM uses Git for committing changes. The details are in the `developer; policy; document <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#obtaining-commit-access>`__. With great power; ----------------. Actually, this would be a great time to read the rest of the `developer; policy <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html>`__, too. At minimum,; you need to be subscribed to the relevant commits list before landing; changes (e.g. llvm-commits@lists.llvm.org), as discussion often happens; there if a new patch causes problems. Post-commit errors; ------------------. Once your change is submitted it will be picked up by automated build; bots that will build and test your patch in a variety of configurations. You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while. The console view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console helps to get a; better understanding of the build results of a specific patch. If you; want to follow along how your change is affecting the build bots, **this; should be the first place to look at** - the colored bubbles correspond; to projects in the waterfall. If you see a broken build, do not despair - some build bots are; continuously broken; if your change broke the build, you will see a red; bubble in the console view, while an already broken build will show an; orange bubble.

By default, each target can appear in multiple distributions; a target will be; installed as part of all distributions it appears in, and it'll be exported by; the last distribution it appears in (the order of distributions is the order; they appear in *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS*). We also define some umbrella targets (e.g.; ``llvm-libraries`` to install all LLVM libraries); a target can appear in a; different distribution than its umbrella, in which case the target will be; exported by the distribution it appears in (and not the distribution its; umbrella appears in). Set *LLVM_STRICT_DISTRIBUTIONS* to ``On`` if you want to; enforce a target appearing in only one distribution and umbrella distributions; being consistent with target distributions. We strongly encourage looking at ``clang/cmake/caches/MultiDistributionExample.cmake``; as an example of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows.

This is useful in; cases where the memory accessed by the snippet depends on the location; of the snippet, like RIP-relative addressing. EXAMPLE 1: benchmarking instructions; ------------------------------------. Assume you have an X86-64 machine. To measure the latency of a single; instruction, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=latency --opcode-name=ADD64rr. Measuring the uop decomposition or inverse throughput of an instruction works similarly:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=uops --opcode-name=ADD64rr; $ llvm-exegesis --mode=inverse_throughput --opcode-name=ADD64rr. The output is a YAML document (the default is to write to stdout, but you can; redirect the output to a file using `--benchmarks-file`):. .. code-block:: none. ---; key:; opcode_name: ADD64rr; mode: latency; config: ''; cpu_name: haswell; llvm_triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu; num_repetitions: 10000; measurements:; - { key: latency, value: 1.0058, debug_string: '' }; error: ''; info: 'explicit self cycles, selecting one aliasing configuration.; Snippet:; ADD64rr R8, R8, R10; '; ... To measure the latency of all instructions for the host architecture, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=latency --opcode-index=-1. EXAMPLE 2: benchmarking a custom code snippet; ---------------------------------------------. To measure the latency/uops of a custom piece of code, you can specify the; `snippets-file` option (`-` reads from standard input). .. code-block:: bash. $ echo ""vzeroupper"" | llvm-exegesis --mode=uops --snippets-file=-.

This is the default for arm64.; * ``always`` - Always emit DWARF unwind regardless.; * ``default`` - Use the platform-specific default (``always`` for all; non-arm64-platforms). ``no-compact-unwind`` is a performance optimization -- Clang will emit smaller; object files that are more quickly processed by the linker. This may cause; binary compatibility issues on older x86_64 targets, however, so use it with; caution. .. _configuration-files:. Configuration files; -------------------. Configuration files group command-line options and allow all of them to be; specified just by referencing the configuration file. They may be used, for; example, to collect options required to tune compilation for particular; target, such as ``-L``, ``-I``, ``-l``, ``--sysroot``, codegen options, etc. Configuration files can be either specified on the command line or loaded; from default locations. If both variants are present, the default configuration; files are loaded first. The command line option ``--config=`` can be used to specify explicit; configuration files in a Clang invocation. If the option is used multiple times,; all specified files are loaded, in order. For example:. ::. clang --config=/home/user/cfgs/testing.txt; clang --config=debug.cfg --config=runtimes.cfg. If the provided argument contains a directory separator, it is considered as; a file path, and options are read from that file. Otherwise the argument is; treated as a file name and is searched for sequentially in the directories:. - user directory,; - system directory,; - the directory where Clang executable resides. Both user and system directories for configuration files are specified during; clang build using CMake parameters, ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_USER_DIR`` and; ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_DIR`` respectively.

This type; of rule is typically used to implement an interactive renaming action that; allows users to specify which occurrences should be renamed during the; refactoring. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to implement; the ``findSymbolOccurrences`` member function. The following set of quick checks might help if you are unsure about the type; of rule you should use:. #. If you would like to transform the source in one translation unit and if; you don't need any cross-TU information, then the; ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` should work for you. #. If you would like to implement a rename-like operation with potential; interactive components, then ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` might; work for you. How to Create a Rule; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once you determine which type of rule is suitable for your needs you can; implement the refactoring by subclassing the rule and implementing its; interface. The subclass should have a constructor that takes the inputs that; are needed to perform the refactoring. For example, if you want to implement a; rule that simply deletes a selection, you should create a subclass of; ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` with a constructor that accepts the selection; range:. .. code-block:: c++. class DeleteSelectedRange final : public SourceChangeRefactoringRule {; public:; DeleteSelection(SourceRange Selection) : Selection(Selection) {}.

Modifiability,"ly. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Toolchains**. The gcc driver has no direct understanding of tool chains. Each gcc; binary roughly corresponds to the information which is embedded; inside a single ToolChain. The clang driver is intended to be portable and support complex; compilation environments. All platform and tool chain specific code; should be protected behind either abstract or well defined interfaces; (such as whether the platform supports use as a driver driver).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:16503,portab,portable,16503,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['portab'],['portable']

To determine whether a statement reads or writes a field we can implement; symbolic evaluation of `DeclRefExpr`s, `LValueToRValue` casts, pointer; dereference operator and `MemberExpr`s. ### Using data flow results to identify output parameters. Let's take a look at how we use data flow analysis to identify an output; parameter. The refactoring can be safely done when the data flow algorithm; computes a normal state with all of the fields proven to be overwritten in the; exit basic block of the function. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; };. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; } else {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; ```. When the data flow algorithm computes a normal state, but not all fields are; proven to be overwritten we can't perform the refactoring. ```c++; void target(bool b, Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; if (b) {; c->account_id = 42; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; } else {; c->name = ""Konrad""; // Overwritten: {c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {}; }; ```. Similarly, when the data flow algorithm computes a failure state, we also can't; perform the refactoring. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; print(c->name); // Unsafe read; } else {; kGlobalCustomer = c; // Pointer escape; }; // Unsafe read, Pointer escape; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead stores. Let's say we want to find redundant stores, because they indicate potential; bugs. ```c++; x = GetX();; x = GetY();; ```. The first store to `x` is never read, probably there is a bug. The implementation of dead store analysis is very similar to output parameter; analysis: we need to track stores",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:19011,refactor,refactoring,19011,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

It is also possible to write n-tuples of arbitrary type by using ROOT's; `TBranch` class. This is especially important as `TNtuple::Fill()`; accepts only floats. The following macro creates the same n-tuple as; before but the branches are booked directly. The `Fill()` function then; fills the current values of the connected variables to the tree. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_ntuple_to_file_advanced.C; ```. The `Branch()` function requires a pointer to a variable and a; definition of the variable type. The following table lists some of the possible; values.; Please note that ROOT is not checking the input and mistakes are likely; to result in serious problems. This holds especially if values are read; as another type than they have been written, e.g. when storing a; variable as float and reading it as double.

The string ""`->`"" in the comment field of the; members `*fTracks` and `*fH` instructs the automatic `Streamer` to; assume that the objects `*fTracks` and `*fH` are never null pointers and; that `fTracks->Streamer` can be used instead of the more time consuming; form `R__b << fTracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr;; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; static TClonesArray *fgTracks;; static TH1F *fgHist;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(Event,1) //Event structure; };; ```. ### The EventHeader Class. The `EventHeader` class (also defined in `Event.h`) does not inherit; from **`TObject`**. Beginning with ROOT 3.0, an object can be placed on; a branch even though it does not inherit from **`TObject`**. In previous; releases branches were restricted to objects inheriting from the; **`TObject`**. However, it has always been possible to write a class not; inheriting from **`TObject`** to a tree by encapsulating it in a; **`TObject`** descending class as is the case in `EventHeader` and; `Event`. ``` {.cpp}; class EventHeader {; private:; Int_t fEvtNum;; Int_t fRun;; Int_t fDate;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(EventHeader,1) //Event Header; };; ```. ### The Track Class. The `Track` class descends from **`TObject`** since tracks are in a; **`TClonesArray`** (i.e. a ROOT collection class) and contains a; selection of basic types and an array of vertices. Its **`TObject`**; inheritance enables `Track` to be in a collection and in `Event` is a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Tracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Track : public TObject {; private:; Float_t fPx; //X component of the momentum; Float_t fPy; //Y component of the momentum; Float_t fPz; //Z component of the momentum; Float_t fRandom; //A random track quantity; Float_t fMass2; //The mass squar",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:60345,inherit,inheriting,60345,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['inherit'],['inheriting']

A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is; required to ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of; different SAs. It ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed; before executing a subsequent vector memory and so can be used to meet the; requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.; * The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges; of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.; * On GFX10.3 and GFX11 a memory attached last level (MALL) cache exists for GPU memory.; The MALL cache is fully coherent with GPU memory and has no impact on system; coherence. All agents (GPU and CPU) access GPU memory through the MALL cache. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively.

Setting a variable in a; CMakeLists file, will set the variable for that file, and all subdirectories.; Variables set in a CMake module that is included in a CMakeLists file will be; set in the scope they are included from, and all subdirectories. When a variable that is already set is set again in a subdirectory it overrides; the value in that scope and any deeper subdirectories. The CMake set command provides two scope-related options. PARENT_SCOPE sets a; variable into the parent scope, and not the current scope. The CACHE option sets; the variable in the CMakeCache, which results in it being set in all scopes. The; CACHE option will not set a variable that already exists in the CACHE unless the; FORCE option is specified. In addition to directory-based scope, CMake functions also have their own scope.; This means variables set inside functions do not bleed into the parent scope.; This is not true of macros, and it is for this reason LLVM prefers functions; over macros whenever reasonable. .. note::; Unlike C-based languages, CMake's loop and control flow blocks do not have; their own scopes.

Modifiability,"ments can be used in the fields of the parent class to; initialize them in a custom manner. That is, record or class ``A`` can; request parent class ``S`` with one set of template arguments, while record or class; ``B`` can request ``S`` with a different set of arguments. Without template; arguments, many more classes would be required, one for each combination of; the template arguments. Both classes and concrete records can include fields that are uninitialized.; The uninitialized ""value"" is represented by a question mark (``?``). Classes; often have uninitialized fields that are expected to be filled in when those; classes are inherited by concrete records. Even so, some fields of concrete; records may remain uninitialized. TableGen provides *multiclasses* to collect a group of record definitions in; one place. A multiclass is a sort of macro that can be ""invoked"" to define; multiple concrete records all at once. A multiclass can inherit from other; multiclasses, which means that the multiclass inherits all the definitions; from its parent multiclasses. `Appendix C: Sample Record`_ illustrates a complex record in the Intel X86; target and the simple way in which it is defined. Source Files; ============. TableGen source files are plain ASCII text files. The files can contain; statements, comments, and blank lines (see `Lexical Analysis`_). The standard file; extension for TableGen files is ``.td``. TableGen files can grow quite large, so there is an include mechanism that; allows one file to include the content of another file (see `Include; Files`_). This allows large files to be broken up into smaller ones, and; also provides a simple library mechanism where multiple source files can; include the same library file.

Please note that Clang does not and will not support all of the GCC builtins; for vector operations. Instead of using builtins, you should use the functions; defined in target-specific header files like ``<xmmintrin.h>``, which define; portable wrappers for these. Many of the Clang versions of these functions are; implemented directly in terms of :ref:`extended vector support; <langext-vectors>` instead of builtins, in order to reduce the number of; builtins that we need to implement. ``__builtin_alloca``; --------------------. ``__builtin_alloca`` is used to dynamically allocate memory on the stack.

Modifiability,"ments in registers. Live out values are typically return values in; registers. Live in values are marked as such, and are given a dummy ""defining""; instruction during live intervals analysis. If the last basic block of a; function is a ``return``, then it's marked as using all live out values in the; function. ``PHI`` nodes need to be handled specially, because the calculation of the live; variable information from a depth first traversal of the CFG of the function; won't guarantee that a virtual register used by the ``PHI`` node is defined; before it's used. When a ``PHI`` node is encountered, only the definition is; handled, because the uses will be handled in other basic blocks. For each ``PHI`` node of the current basic block, we simulate an assignment at; the end of the current basic block and traverse the successor basic blocks. If a; successor basic block has a ``PHI`` node and one of the ``PHI`` node's operands; is coming from the current basic block, then the variable is marked as *alive*; within the current basic block and all of its predecessor basic blocks, until; the basic block with the defining instruction is encountered. Live Intervals Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. We now have the information available to perform the live intervals analysis and; build the live intervals themselves. We start off by numbering the basic blocks; and machine instructions. We then handle the ""live-in"" values. These are in; physical registers, so the physical register is assumed to be killed by the end; of the basic block. Live intervals for virtual registers are computed for some; ordering of the machine instructions ``[1, N]``. A live interval is an interval; ``[i, j)``, where ``1 >= i >= j > N``, for which a variable is live. .. note::; More to come... .. _Register Allocation:; .. _register allocator:.

Modifiability,"merical calculation; of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off; both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of; the limits (expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by; distance between limits). The user must therefore be aware of the fact; that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then; the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of; most machines. The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course,; so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the; ''parabolic'' parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users; should however realize that the transformation is only a linear; approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or; more parameters is very close to a limit, where; $\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0$. Therefore, it is; recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the; limits should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits. ### How to Get the Right Answer from Minuit. `Minuit` offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms.; The `MIGRAD` algorithm is in general the best minimized for nearly all; functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line search, a; stable metric updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness.; Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first; derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very inaccurate.

The result of the expression is returned,; if it is either a builtin type (int, long, float, double, and; `const char*` are supported), a Python type that can cross, or a ROOT; type.

Modifiability,"modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant. If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module. A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific; numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces; may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target; instructions are used to access the variable. The default address space; is zero. The address space qualifier must precede any other attributes. LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for globals.

Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

As for LLVM SSA registers, we have not found it necessary to associate a label; with each byte or bit of data, as some other tools do. Instead, labels are; associated directly with registers. Loads will result in a union of; all shadow labels corresponding to bytes loaded, and stores will; result in a copy of the label of the stored value to the shadow of all; bytes stored to. Propagating labels through arguments; ------------------------------------. In order to propagate labels through function arguments and return values,; DataFlowSanitizer changes the ABI of each function in the translation unit.; There are currently two supported ABIs:. * Args -- Argument and return value labels are passed through additional; arguments and by modifying the return type. * TLS -- Argument and return value labels are passed through TLS variables; ``__dfsan_arg_tls`` and ``__dfsan_retval_tls``. The main advantage of the TLS ABI is that it is more tolerant of ABI mismatches; (TLS storage is not shared with any other form of storage, whereas extra; arguments may be stored in registers which under the native ABI are not used; for parameter passing and thus could contain arbitrary values). On the other; hand the args ABI is more efficient and allows ABI mismatches to be more easily; identified by checking for nonzero labels in nominally unlabelled programs. Implementing the ABI list; -------------------------. The `ABI list <DataFlowSanitizer.html#abi-list>`_ provides a list of functions; which conform to the native ABI, each of which is callable from an instrumented; program. This is implemented by replacing each reference to a native ABI; function with a reference to a function which uses the instrumented ABI.; Such functions are automatically-generated wrappers for the native functions.; For example, given the ABI ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst:10295,variab,variables,10295,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly; used by C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by; Clang developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers; who happen to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their; functionality. They are developed in three components: the underlying; infrastructure for building a standalone tool based on Clang, core; shared logic used by many different tools in the form of refactoring and; rewriting libraries, and the tools themselves. The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the; :doc:`LibTooling <LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much; more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The; common refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of; LibTooling organizationally. A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as; examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of; the tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation; from the core libraries. We intentionally do not support public; libraries in the side repository, as we want to carefully review and; find good APIs for libraries as they are lifted out of a few tools and; into the core Clang library set. Regardless of which repository Clang Tools' code resides in, the; development process and practices for all Clang Tools are ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst:1401,refactor,refactoring,1401,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

Modifiability,"mpiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If you; have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic up on; the llvm-dev list. At the very worst, you can always treat LLVM as if it; were a ""dumb code generator"" and implement the high-level optimizations; you desire in your front-end, on the language-specific AST. Tips and Tricks; ===============. There is a variety of useful tips and tricks that you come to know after; working on/with LLVM that aren't obvious at first glance. Instead of; letting everyone rediscover them, this section talks about some of these; issues. Implementing portable offsetof/sizeof; -------------------------------------. One interesting thing that comes up, if you are trying to keep the code; generated by your compiler ""target independent"", is that you often need; to know the size of some LLVM type or the offset of some field in an; llvm structure. For example, you might need to pass the size of a type; into a function that allocates memory. Unfortunately, this can vary widely across targets: for example the; width of a pointer is trivially target-specific. However, there is a; `clever way to use the getelementptr; instruction <http://nondot.org/sabre/LLVMNotes/SizeOf-OffsetOf-VariableSizedStructs.txt>`_; that allows you to compute this in a portable way. Garbage Collected Stack Frames; ------------------------------. Some languages want to explicitly manage their stack frames, often so; that they are garbage collected or to allow easy implementation of; closures. There are often better ways to implement these features than; explicit stack frames, but `LLVM does ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst:11505,portab,portable,11505,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,1,['portab'],['portable']
Modifiability,"mpiler IR, as an on-disk bitcode representation; (suitable for fast loading by a Just-In-Time compiler), and as a human; readable assembly language representation. This allows LLVM to provide a; powerful intermediate representation for efficient compiler; transformations and analysis, while providing a natural means to debug; and visualize the transformations. The three different forms of LLVM are; all equivalent. This document describes the human readable; representation and notation. The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while; being expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be; a ""universal IR"" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that; high-level ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how; microprocessors are ""universal IR's"", allowing many source languages to; be mapped to them). By providing type information, LLVM can be used as; the target of optimizations: for example, through pointer analysis, it; can be proven that a C automatic variable is never accessed outside of; the current function, allowing it to be promoted to a simple SSA value; instead of a memory location. .. _wellformed:. Well-Formedness; ---------------. It is important to note that this document describes 'well formed' LLVM; assembly language. There is a difference between what the parser accepts; and what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following; instruction is syntactically okay, but not well formed:. .. code-block:: llvm. %x = add i32 1, %x. because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The; LLVM infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to; verify that an LLVM module is well formed.

Modifiability,"mpute, as follows (using C syntax):. .. code-block:: c++. idx1 = (char*) &MyVar + 0; idx2 = (char*) &MyVar + 4; idx3 = (char*) &MyVar + 8. Since the type ``i32`` is known to be four bytes long, the indices 0, 1 and 2; translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No memory is; accessed to make these computations because the address of ``@MyVar`` is passed; directly to the GEP instructions. The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of ``%idx2`` and ``%idx3``. They; result in the computation of addresses that point to memory past the end of the; ``@MyVar`` global, which is only one ``i32`` long, not three ``i32``\s long.; While this is legal in LLVM, it is inadvisable because any load or store with; the pointer that results from these GEP instructions would trigger undefined; behavior (UB). Why is the extra 0 index required?; ----------------------------------. Quick answer: there are no superfluous indices. This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a global; variable which is always a pointer type. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. %MyStruct = external global { ptr, i32 }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { ptr, i32 }, ptr %MyStruct, i64 0, i32 1. The GEP above yields a ``ptr`` by indexing the ``i32`` typed field of the; structure ``%MyStruct``. When people first look at it, they wonder why the ``i64; 0`` index is needed. However, a closer inspection of how globals and GEPs work; reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following facts will dispel the; confusion:. #. The type of ``%MyStruct`` is *not* ``{ ptr, i32 }`` but rather ``ptr``.; That is, ``%MyStruct`` is a pointer (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``.

You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================. For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator. The `documentation; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#path_and_environment>`_; describes the necessary environment variable settings, but the simplest thing; is to use a `developer command-prompt window; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts>`_; or call a `developer command file; <https://docs.microsoft.co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst:2230,variab,variable,2230,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"n ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If you; have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic up on; the llvm-dev list. At the very worst, you can always treat LLVM as if it; were a ""dumb code generator"" and implement the high-level optimizations; you desire in your front-end, on the language-specific A",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst:10177,enhance,enhancements,10177,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,2,"['enhance', 'extend']","['enhancements', 'extend']"

However, because debug variable locations are defined for; every machine instruction, in effect every IR instruction uses every variable; location, which would lead to a large number of debugging intrinsics being; generated. Examining the example above, variable ``!30`` is assigned ``%input`` on both; conditional paths through the function, while ``!23`` is assigned differing; constant values on either path. Where control flow merges in ``%bb1`` we would; want ``!30`` to keep its location (``%input``), but ``!23`` to become undefined; as we cannot determine at runtime what value it should have in %bb1 without; inserting a PHI node. mem2reg does not insert the PHI node to avoid changing; codegen when debugging is enabled, and does not insert the other dbg.values; to avoid adding very large numbers of intrinsics. Instead, LiveDebugValues determines variable locations when control; flow merges. A dataflow analysis is used to propagate locations between blocks:; when control flow merges, if a variable has the same location in all; predecessors then that location is propagated into the successor. If the; predecessor locations disagree, the location becomes undefined. Once LiveDebugValues has run, every block should have all valid variable; locations described by DBG_VALUE instructions within the block. Very little; effort is then required by supporting classes (such as; DbgEntityHistoryCalculator) to build a map of each instruction to every; valid variable location, without the need to consider control flow. From; the example above, it is otherwise difficult to determine that the location; of variable ``!30`` should flow ""up"" into block ``%bb1``, but that the location; of variable ``!23`` should not flow ""down"" into the ``%exit`` block. .. _ccxx_frontend:.

The string ""`->`"" in the comment field of the; members `*fTracks` and `*fH` instructs the automatic `Streamer` to; assume that the objects `*fTracks` and `*fH` are never null pointers and; that `fTracks->Streamer` can be used instead of the more time consuming; form `R__b << fTracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr;; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; static TClonesArray *fgTracks;; static TH1F *fgHist;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(Event,1) //Event structure; };; ```. ### The EventHeader Class. The `EventHeader` class (also defined in `Event.h`) does not inherit; from **`TObject`**. Beginning with ROOT 3.0, an object can be placed on; a branch even though it does not inherit from **`TObject`**. In previous; releases branches were restricted to objects inheriting from the; **`TObject`**. However, it has always been possible to write a class not; inheriting from **`TObject`** to a tree by encapsulating it in a; **`TObject`** descending class as is the case in `EventHeader` and; `Event`. ``` {.cpp}; class EventHeader {; private:; Int_t fEvtNum;; Int_t fRun;; Int_t fDate;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(EventHeader,1) //Event Header; };; ```. ### The Track Class. The `Track` class descends from **`TObject`** since tracks are in a; **`TClonesArray`** (i.e. a ROOT collection class) and contains a; selection of basic types and an array of vertices.

This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own. Typically, you will want to build your **lib** directory first followed by your; **tools** directory. Writing LLVM Style Makefiles; ============================. The LLVM build system provides a convenient way to build libraries and; executables. Most of your project Makefiles will only need to define a few; variables. Below is a list of the variables one can set and what they can; do:. Required Variables; ------------------. ``LEVEL``. This variable is the relative path from this ``Makefile`` to the top; directory of your project's source code. For example, if your source code; is in ``/tmp/src``, then the ``Makefile`` in ``/tmp/src/jump/high``; would set ``LEVEL`` to ``""../..""``. Variables for Building Subdirectories; -------------------------------------. ``DIRS``. This is a space separated list of subdirectories that should be built. They; will be built, one at a time, in the order specified. ``PARALLEL_DIRS``. This is a list of directories that can be built in parallel. These will be; built after the directories in DIRS have been built. ``OPTIONAL_DIRS``. This is a list of directories that can be built if they exist, but will not; cause an error if they do not exist. They are built serially in the order; in which they are listed.

When you create a branch in the main ROOT repository (i.e., this repository) and add a test to `roottest`,; make sure to do this under the same branch name (and open a PR for it). Our CI infrastructure automatically picks up the; changes defined in the `roottest` PR based on this branch name, and uses that for testing your PR here. ## Continuous Integration.

A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened; by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The; redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.; The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.; When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended; attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,; the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the; pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.; It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen many updates during the last few months. Specifically, v6.28 includes the following changes:. - Complete support for big-endian architectures (PR [#10402](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10402)). - Support for `std::pair<T1, T2>` and `std::tuple<Ts...>` fields. - Support for C array fields whose type is of the form `T[N]`. Note that only single-dimension arrays are currently supported. - Improvements to the ROOT file embedding (PR [#10558](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10558)).

This has been; changed to an Armv9.0a core. However, crypto options are not enabled; by default for Armv9 cores, so `-mcpu=neoverse-n2+crypto` is now required; to enable crypto for this core. As far as the compiler is concerned,; Armv9.0a has the same features enabled as Armv8.5a, with the exception; of crypto. * ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:2442,config,configuration,2442,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

Constants, which are described in the section Constants_ below. LLVM requires that values start with a prefix for two reasons: Compilers; don't need to worry about name clashes with reserved words, and the set; of reserved words may be expanded in the future without penalty.; Additionally, unnamed identifiers allow a compiler to quickly come up; with a temporary variable without having to avoid symbol table; conflicts. Reserved words in LLVM are very similar to reserved words in other; languages. There are keywords for different opcodes ('``add``',; '``bitcast``', '``ret``', etc...), for primitive type names ('``void``',; '``i32``', etc...), and others. These reserved words cannot conflict; with variable names, because none of them start with a prefix character; (``'%'`` or ``'@'``).

After strength reduction:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = shl i32 %X, 3.

Modifiability,"n goals for the driver, as; well as details of the internal implementation. Features and Goals; ==================. The Clang driver is intended to be a production quality compiler driver; providing access to the Clang compiler and tools, with a command line; interface which is compatible with the gcc driver. Although the driver is part of and driven by the Clang project, it is; logically a separate tool which shares many of the same goals as Clang:. .. contents:: Features; :local:. GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possible.; - Don't parse arguments more than once.; - Provide a few simple interfaces for efficiently searching arguments. Simple; ------. Finally, the driver was designed to be ""as simple as possible"", gi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:1221,flexible,flexible,1221,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['flexible'],['flexible']
Modifiability,"n how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental build",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:10374,config,configuration,10374,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

Rules for updating debug values; ===============================. Deleting an IR-level Instruction; --------------------------------. When an ``Instruction`` is deleted, its debug uses change to ``undef``. This is; a loss of debug info: the value of one or more source variables becomes; unavailable, starting with the ``llvm.dbg.value(undef, ...)``. When there is no; way to reconstitute the value of the lost instruction, this is the best; possible outcome. However, it's often possible to do better:. * If the dying instruction can be RAUW'd, do so. The; ``Value::replaceAllUsesWith`` API transparently updates debug uses of the; dying instruction to point to the replacement value. * If the dying instruction cannot be RAUW'd, call ``llvm::salvageDebugInfo`` on; it. This makes a best-effort attempt to rewrite debug uses of the dying; instruction by describing its effect as a ``DIExpression``. * If one of the **operands** of a dying instruction would become trivially; dead, use ``llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith`` to rewrite the debug uses of that; operand. Consider the following example function:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i16 @foo(i16 %a) {; %b = sext i16 %a to i32; %c = and i32 %b, 15; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %c, ...); %d = trunc i32 %c to i16; ret i16 %d; }. Now, here's what happens after the unnecessary truncation instruction ``%d`` is; replaced with a simplified instruction:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i16 @foo(i16 %a) {; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 undef, ...); %simplified = and i16 %a, 15; ret i16 %simplified; }. Note that after deleting ``%d``, all uses of its operand ``%c`` become; trivially dead. The debug use which used to point to ``%c`` is now ``undef``,; and debug info is needlessly lost. To solve this problem, do:. .. code-block:: cpp. llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith(%c, th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst:7229,rewrite,rewrite,7229,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']
Modifiability,"n is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }. With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly. While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate. If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:6337,variab,variable,6337,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

(The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as the unaligned store. Backends are; also expected to generate an i8 store as an i8 store, and not an instruction; which writes to surrounding bytes.

Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in automatic storage. As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression. Captured variables in Blocks on the heap are destroyed; when the reference count of the Block drops to zero. Variables declared as residing in ``__block`` storage may be initially; allocated in the heap or may first appear on the stack and be copied; to the heap as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. When copied; from the stack, ``__block`` variables are copied using their normal; qualification (i.e. without adding const). In C++11, ``__block``; variables are copied as x-values if that is possible, then as l-values; if not; if both fail, it's an error.

It is also very easy to accidentally forget; to drain an autorelease pool when using the manual API, and this can; significantly inflate the process's high-water-mark.

Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation. This means that the variable is; retained elsewhere, and therefore the implementation can elide retaining and; releasing its value. Such a variable is implicitly ``const`` for safety. In; contrast with ``__unsafe_unretained``, an externally-retained variable still; behaves as a strong variable outside of initialization and destruction. For; instance, when an externally-retained variable is captured in a block the value; of the variable is retained and released on block capture and destruction. It; also affects C++ features such as lambda capture, ``decltype``, and template; argument deduction. Implicitly, the implementation assumes that the :ref:`self parameter in a; non-init method <arc.misc.self>` and the :ref:`variable in a for-in loop; <arc.misc.enumeration>` are externally-retained. Externally-retained semantics can also be opted into with the; ``objc_externally_retained`` attribute.

The ``AllowErrnoReadOutsideConditionExpressions`` option allows read of the; errno value if the value is not used in a condition (in ``if`` statements,; loops, conditional expressions, ``switch`` statements).

Modifiability,"n you're; done with it. ### Use of Python Functions. It is possible to mix Python functions with ROOT and perform such; operations as plotting and fitting of histograms with them. In all; cases, the procedure consists of instantiating a ROOT **`TF1`**,; **`TF2`**, or **`TF3`** with the Python function and working with that; ROOT object. There are some memory issues, so it is for example not yet; possible to delete a **`TF1`** instance and then create another one with; the same name. In addition, the Python function, once used for; instantiating the **`TF1`**, is never deleted. Instead of a Python function, you can also use callable instances (e.g.,; an instance of a class that has implemented the `__call__` member; function). The signature of the Python callable should provide for one; or two arrays. The first array, which must always be present, shall; contain the `x`, `y`, `z`, and t values for the call. The second array,; which is optional and its size depends on the number given to the; **`TF1`** constructor, contains the values that parameterize the; function. For more details, see the **`TF1`** documentation and the; examples below. #### Plotting Python Function. This is an example of a parameter less Python function that is plotted; on a default canvas:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TCanvas. def identity( x ):; return x[0]. # create an identity function; f = TF1('pyf1', identity, -1., 1.). # plot the function; c = TCanvas(); f.Draw(); ```. Because no number of parameters is given to the **`TF1`** constructor,; '`0`' (the default) is assumed. This way, the '`identity'` function need; not handle a second argument, which would normally be used to pass the; function parameters. Note that the argument '`x`' is an array of size 4.; The following is an example of a parameterized Python callable instance; that is plotted on a default canvas:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TF1, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:25931,parameteriz,parameterize,25931,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterize']

As stated above, the **`TIterator`** class is abstract; it is not; possible to create **`TIterator`** objects. However, it should be; possible to write generic code to process all members of a collection so; there is a need for a generic iterator object. A **`TIter`** object acts; as generic iterator. It provides the same `Next()` and `Reset()` methods; as **`TIterator`** although it has no idea how to support them! It works; as follows:. - To create a **`TIter`** object its constructor must be passed an; object that inherits from **`TCollection`**. The **`TIter`**; constructor calls the `MakeIterator()` method of this collection to; get the appropriate iterator object that inherits from; **`TIterator`**. - The `Next()` and `Reset()` methods of **`TIter`** simply call the; `Next()` and `Reset()` methods of the iterator object. Therefore, **`TIter`** simply acts as a wrapper for an object of a; concrete class inheriting from **`TIterator`**. To see this working in practice, consider the **`TObjArray`**; collection. Its associated iterator is **`TObjArrayIter`**. Suppose; `myarray` is a pointer to a **`TObjArray`** that contains `MyClass`; objects, i.e. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray *myarray;; ```. To create a **`TIter`** object called `myiter`:. ``` {.cpp}; TIter myiter(myarray);; ```. ![](pictures/020001A4.jpg). As shown in the diagram, this results in several methods being called:. - The **`TIter`** constructor is passed a **`TObjArray`**. - **`TIter`** asks embedded **`TCollection`** to make an iterator. - **`TCollection`** asks **`TObjArray`** to make an iterator. - **`TObjArray`** returns a **`TObjArrayIter`**.

Modifiability,"n),; or ``+`` (right align). The default is right aligned. ``style`` is an optional string consisting of a type specific that controls the; formatting of the value. For example, to format a floating point value as a percentage,; you can use the style option ``P``. Custom formatting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two ways to customize the formatting behavior for a type. 1. Provide a template specialization of ``llvm::format_provider<T>`` for your; type ``T`` with the appropriate static format method. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; template<>; struct format_provider<MyFooBar> {; static void format(const MyFooBar &V, raw_ostream &Stream, StringRef Style) {; // Do whatever is necessary to format `V` into `Stream`; }; };; void foo() {; MyFooBar X;; std::string S = formatv(""{0}"", X);; }; }. This is a useful extensibility mechanism for adding support for formatting your own; custom types with your own custom Style options. But it does not help when you want; to extend the mechanism for formatting a type that the library already knows how to; format. For that, we need something else. 2. Provide a **format adapter** inheriting from ``llvm::FormatAdapter<T>``. .. code-block:: c++. namespace anything {; struct format_int_custom : public llvm::FormatAdapter<int> {; explicit format_int_custom(int N) : llvm::FormatAdapter<int>(N) {}; void format(llvm::raw_ostream &Stream, StringRef Style) override {; // Do whatever is necessary to format ``this->Item`` into ``Stream``; }; };; }; namespace llvm {; void foo() {; std::string S = formatv(""{0}"", anything::format_int_custom(42));; }; }. If the type is detected to be derived from ``FormatAdapter<T>``, ``formatv``; will call the; ``format`` method on the argument passing in the specified style. This allows; one to provide custom formatting of any type, including one which already has; a builtin format provider. ``formatv`` Examples; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Below is intended to provide an incomplete set of examples demonstrating; the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:14048,extend,extend,14048,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']

An `llvm.dbg.assign` that uses a `DIAssignID` that is not attached; to any instruction indicates that the memory location isn’t valid. **Merging** stores: In many cases no change is required as `DIAssignID`; attachments are automatically merged if `combineMetadata` is called. One way or; another, the `DIAssignID` attachments must be merged such that new store; becomes linked to all the `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics that the merged stores; were linked to. This can be achieved simply by calling a helper function; `Instruction::mergeDIAssignID`. **Inlining** stores: As stores are inlined we generate `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics and `DIAssignID` attachments as if the stores represent source; assignments, just like the in frontend. This isn’t perfect, as stores may have; been moved, modified or deleted before inlining, but it does at least keep the; information about the variable correct within the non-inlined scope. **Splitting** stores: SROA and passes that split stores treat `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics similarly to `llvm.dbg.declare` intrinsics. Clone the; `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics linked to the store, update the FragmentInfo in; the `ValueExpression`, and give the split stores (and cloned intrinsics) new; `DIAssignID` attachments each. In other words, treat the split stores as; separate assignments.

Occurrences of class `MyClass`; of `MyLib` will now be referenced as `../mylib/MyClass.html`. ### Search Engine. **`THtml`** can invoke external search engines. The ROOT reference guide; sets `Root.Html.Search` to <http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+site%3A%u>.; Calling **`THtml::SetSearchStemURL()`** will set the same. If this URL stem is; set, `THtml` will create search fields in the index pages. It will; send the words entered in these search fields as %s in the URL; %u will; be replaced by the current document's path, allowing a site- and; directory-specific search. ### ViewCVS. Most code is managed in a version control system like CVS. ViewCVS is a; WWW reader interface to the versioning control system that allows e.g.; tracking a file's changes. **`THtml`** will reference these pages; automatically if the `.rootrc` variable `Root.Html.ViewCVS` is set to; the URL stem of the ViewCVS. installation. Alternatively, one can call; THtml::SetViewCVS(). ### Wiki Pages. In some contexts it might be desirable to let users comment on classes,; e.g. for suggestions of use or alternatives, details of behavior, and; cross references to other relevant classes. A successful example of this; is the PHP.net documentation with its user annotations. **`THtml`** can; include a link to a class's Wiki page by setting the Wiki base URL via; `Root.Html.WikiURL` or **`THtml`**`::SetWikiURL()`. ## Tutorial. You can run the tutorial `htmlex.C` to see how **`THtml`** converts a; script to HTML and how it creates the corresponding class reference:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x $(ROOTSYS)/tutorials/htmlex.C+; ```.

Modifiability,"namically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============. The compound statement of a Block is treated much like a function body; with respect to control flow in that goto, break, and continue do not; escape the Block. Exceptions are treated *normally* in that when; thrown they pop stack frames until a catch clause is found. Objective-C Extensions; ======================.

Allocator; ---------; Scudo was designed with security in mind, but aims at striking a good balance; between security and performance. It was designed to be highly tunable and; configurable, and while we provide some default configurations, we encourage; consumers to come up with the parameters that will work best for their use; cases. The allocator combines several components that serve distinct purposes:. - the Primary allocator: fast and efficient, it services smaller allocation; sizes by carving reserved memory regions into blocks of identical size. There; are currently two Primary allocators implemented, specific to 32 and 64 bit; architectures. It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of caches. - the Quarantine: offers a way to delay the deallocation operations, preventing; blocks to be immediately available for reuse. Blocks held will be recycled; once certain size criteria are reached. This is essentially a delayed freelist; which can help mitigate some use-after-free situations.

The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #.

Braced Initializer Lists; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Starting from C++11, there are significantly more uses of braced lists to; perform initialization. For example, they can be used to construct aggregate; temporaries in expressions. They now have a natural way of ending up nested; within each other and within function calls in order to build up aggregates; (such as option structs) from local variables. The historically common formatting of braced initialization of aggregate; variables does not mix cleanly with deep nesting, general expression contexts,; function arguments, and lambdas. We suggest new code use a simple rule for; formatting braced initialization lists: act as-if the braces were parentheses; in a function call. The formatting rules exactly match those already well; understood for formatting nested function calls. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. foo({a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3});. llvm::Constant *Mask[] = {; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 0),; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 1),; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 2)};.

Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Name##PluginInfo();``; - ``extern ""C"" ::llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo llvmGetPassPluginInfo() LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK;``. Pass plugins are compiled and linked dynamically by default. Setting; ``LLVM_${NAME}_LINK_INTO_TOOLS`` to ``ON`` turns the project into a statically; linked extension. For an in-tree example, see ``llvm/examples/Bye/``. To make ``PassBuilder`` aware of statically linked pass plugins:. .. code-block:: c++. // Declare plugin extension function declarations.; #define HANDLE_EXTENSION(Ext) llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Ext##PluginInfo();; #include ""llvm/Support/Extension.def"". ... // Register plugin extensions in PassBuilder.; #define HANDLE_EXTENSION(Ext) get##Ext##PluginInfo().RegisterPassBuilderCallbacks(PB);; #include ""llvm/Support/Extension.def"".

MathCore Numerical Algorithms. Classes implementing numerical methods which can be used by all the other ROOT library have been added in MathCore. These originate mainly from methods present previously in the implementation of the TF1 class. Now they can be used also outside this class. In addition, in order to have a common entry point, interfaces classes for these numerical algorithms have been; included.; These interfaces are as well implemented by classes using the GSL library and located in the MathMore library. The library can be loaded automatically using the ROOT plug-in manager.; In detail, the new classes containing implementations present previously in TF1 are:. ; GaussIntegrator and GaussLegendreIntegrator for numerical integration of one-dimensional functions. The first class uses Gaussian 8 and 16 point quadrature approximation, it provides the translation of the CERNLIB algorithm; DGAUSS by Sigfried Kolbig, and it is used by the TF1::Integral method. The second one uses the Gauss Legendre quadrature formula. It is used by the TF1::IntegralFast method.; These classes implement both the same virtual interface as the adaptive integration methods provided by the MathMore library. They can all be created and used easily via the common class ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim providing the interfaces for numerical integration.; New template methods have been also included in the common Integration class in order to be able to integrate automatically any C++ callable object.

We can require that; the increment step be a unary increment like this:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""++""))). Specifying what is incremented introduces another quirk of Clang's AST:; Usages of variables are represented as ``DeclRefExpr``'s (""declaration; reference expressions"") because they are expressions which refer to; variable declarations. To find a ``unaryOperator`` that refers to a; specific declaration, we can simply add a second condition to it:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(; hasOperatorName(""++""),; hasUnaryOperand(declRefExpr()))). Furthermore, we can restrict our matcher to only match if the; incremented variable is an integer:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(; hasOperatorName(""++""),; hasUnaryOperand(declRefExpr(to(varDecl(hasType(isInteger()))))))). And the last step will be to attach an identifier to this variable, so; that we can retrieve it in the callback:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(; hasOperatorName(""++""),; hasUnaryOperand(declRefExpr(to(; varDecl(hasType(isInteger())).bind(""incrementVariable"")))))). We can add this code to the definition of ``LoopMatcher`` and make sure; that our program, outfitted with the new matcher, only prints out loops; that declare a single variable initialized to zero and have an increment; step consisting of a unary increment of some variable. Now, we just need to add a matcher to check if the condition part of the; ``for`` loop compares a variable against the size of the array.

Modifiability,"nd purpose: they; establish the substitution order so that both ``%{check}`` and its parameters; expand as desired. There's a simple way to remember the required definition; order in a test file: define a substitution before any substitution that might; refer to it. In general, substitution expansion behaves as follows:. - Upon arriving at each ``RUN:`` line, lit expands all substitutions in that; ``RUN:`` line using their current values from the substitution list. No; substitution expansion is performed immediately at ``DEFINE:`` and; ``REDEFINE:`` directives except ``%(line)``, ``%(line+<number>)``, and; ``%(line-<number>)``.; - When expanding substitutions in a ``RUN:`` line, lit makes only one pass; through the substitution list by default. In this case, a substitution must; have been inserted earlier in the substitution list than any substitution; appearing in its value in order for the latter to expand. (For greater; flexibility, you can enable multiple passes through the substitution list by; setting `recursiveExpansionLimit`_ in a lit configuration file.); - While lit configuration files can insert anywhere in the substitution list,; the insertion behavior of the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives is; specified below and is designed specifically for the use case presented in the; example above.; - Defining a substitution in terms of itself, whether directly or via other; substitutions, should be avoided. It usually produces an infinitely recursive; definition that cannot be fully expanded. It does *not* define the; substitution in terms of its previous value, even when using ``REDEFINE:``. The relationship between the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directive is; analogous to the relationship between a variable declaration and variable; assignment in many programming languages:. - ``DEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to a new substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there is already a; subst",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:31766,config,configuration,31766,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

If it is not specified, two; copies of the tree headers are saved. ``` {.cpp}; void tree3AddBranch() {; TFile f(""tree3.root"",""update"");; Float_t new_v;; TTree *t3 = (TTree*)f->Get(""t3"");; TBranch *newBranch = t3-> Branch(""new_v"",&new_v,""new_v/F"");; //read the number of entries in the t3; Int_t nentries = (Int_t)t3->GetEntries();; for (Int_t i = 0; i < nentries; i++){; new_v= gRandom->Gaus(0,1);; newBranch->Fill();; }; t3->Write("""",TObject::kOverwrite); // save only the new version of; // the tree; }; ```. Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only; file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the; new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::AddFriend. A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method.

To do; this, :program:`FileCheck` supports string substitution blocks that allow; string variables to be defined and substituted into patterns. Here is a simple; example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: test5:; ; CHECK: notw	[[REGISTER:%[a-z]+]]; ; CHECK: andw	{{.*}}[[REGISTER]]. The first check line matches a regex ``%[a-z]+`` and captures it into the; string variable ``REGISTER``. The second line verifies that whatever is in; ``REGISTER`` occurs later in the file after an ""``andw``"". :program:`FileCheck`; string substitution blocks are always contained in ``[[ ]]`` pairs, and string; variable names can be formed with the regex ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*``. If a; colon follows the name, then it is a definition of the variable; otherwise, it; is a substitution. :program:`FileCheck` variables can be defined multiple times, and substitutions; always get the latest value. Variables can also be substituted later on the; same line they were defined on. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: op [[REG:r[0-9]+]], [[REG]].

The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ErrorInfo utility, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class BadFileFormat : public ErrorInfo<BadFileFormat> {; public:; static char ID;; std::string Path;.

Optimization outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }.

However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time.

Where did all of my code go??; -----------------------------; If you are using the LLVM demo page, you may often wonder what happened to; all of the code that you typed in. Remember that the demo script is running; the code through the LLVM optimizers, so if your code doesn't actually do; anything useful, it might all be deleted. To prevent this, make sure that the code is actually needed. For example, if; you are computing some expression, return the value from the function instead; of leaving it in a local variable. If you really want to constrain the; optimizer, you can read from and assign to ``volatile`` global variables. What is this ""``undef``"" thing that shows up in my code?; --------------------------------------------------------; ``undef`` is the LLVM way of representing a value that is not defined. You; can get these if you do not initialize a variable before you use it. For; example, the C function:. .. code-block:: c. int X() { int i; return i; }. Is compiled to ""``ret i32 undef``"" because ""``i``"" never has a value specified; for it.

Why not make the verifier reject it?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; This is a common problem run into by authors of front-ends that are using; custom calling conventions: you need to make sure to set the right calling; convention on both the function and on each call to the function.

But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper() {; ...; }. bool StringSort::operator<(const char *RHS) const {; ...; }.

Modifiability,"nding the Language: Mutable Variables; =======================================================. .. contents::; :local:. Chapter 7 Introduction; ======================. Welcome to Chapter 7 of the ""`Implementing a language with; LLVM <index.html>`_"" tutorial. In chapters 1 through 6, we've built a; very respectable, albeit simple, `functional programming; language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>`_. In our; journey, we learned some parsing techniques, how to build and represent; an AST, how to build LLVM IR, and how to optimize the resultant code as; well as JIT compile it. While Kaleidoscope is interesting as a functional language, the fact; that it is functional makes it ""too easy"" to generate LLVM IR for it. In; particular, a functional language makes it very easy to build LLVM IR; directly in `SSA; form <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_.; Since LLVM requires that the input code be in SSA form, this is a very; nice property and it is often unclear to newcomers how to generate code; for an imperative language with mutable variables. The short (and happy) summary of this chapter is that there is no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:1164,variab,variables,1164,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Note that some code bases (e.g. ``libc++``) have special reasons to deviate; from the coding standards. For example, in the case of ``libc++``, this is; because the naming and other conventions are dictated by the C++ standard. There are some conventions that are not uniformly followed in the code base; (e.g. the naming convention). This is because they are relatively new, and a; lot of code was written before they were put in place. Our long term goal is; for the entire codebase to follow the convention, but we explicitly *do not*; want patches that do large-scale reformatting of existing code. On the other; hand, it is reasonable to rename the methods of a class if you're about to; change it in some other way. Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------.

For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_. The question for this article is ""who places the phi nodes when lowering; assignments to mutable variables?"".

Once the ``compile_commands.json`` file has been created by Ninja, you can; use that compilation database with Clang Tooling. One caveat is that because; there are indirect settings obtained through the environment variables,; you may need to run any Clang Tooling executables through a command prompt; window created for use with Visual Studio as described above.

The ``annotation`` metadata can be used to attach a tuple of annotation strings; or a tuple of a tuple of annotation strings to any instruction. This metadata does; not impact the semantics of the program and may only be used to provide additional; insight about the program and transformations to users. Example:. .. code-block:: text. %a.addr = alloca ptr, align 8, !annotation !0; !0 = !{!""auto-init""}.

'``func_sanitize``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``func_sanitize`` metadata is used to attach two values for the function; sanitizer instrumentation. The first value is the ubsan function signature.; The second value is the address of the proxy variable which stores the address; of the RTTI descriptor. If :ref:`prologue <prologuedata>` and '``func_sanitize``'; are used at the same time, :ref:`prologue <prologuedata>` is emitted before; '``func_sanitize``' in the output. Example:. .. code-block:: text. @__llvm_rtti_proxy = private unnamed_addr constant ptr @_ZTIFvvE; define void @_Z3funv() !func_sanitize !0 {; return void; }; !0 = !{i32 846595819, ptr @__llvm_rtti_proxy}. .. _md_kcfi_type:.

The type data is emitted before the; function entry in the assembly. Indirect calls with the :ref:`kcfi operand; bundle<ob_kcfi>` will emit a check that compares the type identifier to the; metadata. Example:. .. code-block:: text. define dso_local i32 @f() !kcfi_type !0 {; ret i32 0; }; !0 = !{i32 12345678}.

Machine operands can have C/C++ style comments, which are annotations enclosed; between ``/*`` and ``*/`` to improve readability of e.g. immediate operands.; In the example below, ARM instructions EOR and BCC and immediate operands; ``14`` and ``0`` have been annotated with their condition codes (CC); definitions, i.e. the ``always`` and ``eq`` condition codes:. .. code-block:: text. dead renamable $r2, $cpsr = tEOR killed renamable $r2, renamable $r1, 14 /* CC::always */, $noreg; t2Bcc %bb.4, 0 /* CC:eq */, killed $cpsr. As these annotations are comments, they are ignored by the MI parser.; Comments can be added or customized by overriding InstrInfo's hook; ``createMIROperandComment()``. Debug-Info constructs; ---------------------. Most of the debugging information in a MIR file is to be found in the metadata; of the embedded module. Within a machine function, that metadata is referred to; by various constructs to describe source locations and variable locations. Source locations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every MIR instruction may optionally have a trailing reference to a; ``DILocation`` metadata node, after all operands and symbols, but before; memory operands:. .. code-block:: text. $rbp = MOV64rr $rdi, debug-location !12.

This example illustrates a few important details about LLVM debugging; information. In particular, it shows how the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic and; location information, which are attached to an instruction, are applied; together to allow a debugger to analyze the relationship between statements,; variable definitions, and the code used to implement the function. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata i32* %X, metadata !11, metadata !13), !dbg !14; ; [debug line = 2:7] [debug variable = X].

Scudo is currently the default allocator in; `Fuchsia <https://fuchsia.dev/>`_, and in `Android <https://www.android.com/>`_; since Android 11. The name ""Scudo"" comes from the Italian word for; `shield <https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/scudo>`_; (and Escudo in Spanish). Design; ======. Allocator; ---------; Scudo was designed with security in mind, but aims at striking a good balance; between security and performance. It was designed to be highly tunable and; configurable, and while we provide some default configurations, we encourage; consumers to come up with the parameters that will work best for their use; cases. The allocator combines several components that serve distinct purposes:. - the Primary allocator: fast and efficient, it services smaller allocation; sizes by carving reserved memory regions into blocks of identical size. There; are currently two Primary allocators implemented, specific to 32 and 64 bit; architectures. It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of cac",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst:979,config,configurable,979,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,2,['config'],"['configurable', 'configurations']"

The type is used for a byte count to decide how much space to allocate.; The variable written is simply the block of bytes starting at the; starting address given in the second parameter. It may or may not match; the leaf list depending on whether or not the programmer is being; careful when choosing the leaf address, name, and type. By default, a variable will be copied with the number of bytes specified; in the type descriptor symbol. However, if the type consists of two; characters, the number specifies the number of bytes to be used when; copying the variable to the output buffer. The line below describes; `ntrack` to be written as a 16-bit integer (rather than a 32-bit; integer). ``` {.cpp}; ""ntrack/I2""; ```. With this Branch method, you can also add a leaf that holds an entire; array of variables. To add an array of floats use the `f[n]` notation; when describing the leaf. ``` {.cpp}; Float_t f[10];; tree->Branch(""fBranch"",f,""f[10]/F"");; ```. You can also add an array of variable length:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TFile *f = new TFile(""peter.root"",""recreate"");; Int_t nPhot;; Float_t E[500];; TTree* nEmcPhotons = new TTree(""nEmcPhotons"",""EMC Photons"");; nEmcPhotons->Branch(""nPhot"",&nPhot,""nPhot/I"");; nEmcPhotons->Branch(""E"",E,""E[nPhot]/F"");; }; ```.

When; demonstrating instructions, we will follow an instruction with a comment; that defines the type and name of value produced. High Level Structure; ====================. Module Structure; ----------------. LLVM programs are composed of ``Module``'s, each of which is a; translation unit of the input programs.

Every global variable and pointer type is assigned to one of these address; spaces, with 0 being the default address space. Intrinsics are provided which; can be used to convert pointers between the generic and non-generic address; spaces.

Modifiability,"neral improvements; ====================; - New collapse clause scheme to avoid expensive remainder operations.; Compute loop index variables after collapsing a loop nest via the; collapse clause by replacing the expensive remainder operation with; multiplications and additions. - When using the collapse clause on a loop nest the default behavior; is to automatically extend the representation of the loop counter to; 64 bits for the cases where the sizes of the collapsed loops are not; known at compile time. To prevent this conservative choice and use; at most 32 bits, compile your program with the; `-fopenmp-optimistic-collapse`. GPU devices support; ===================. Data-sharing modes; ------------------. Clang supports two data-sharing models for Cuda devices: `Generic` and `Cuda`; modes. The default mode is `Generic`. `Cuda` mode can give an additional; performance and can be activated using the `-fopenmp-cuda-mode` flag. In; `Generic` mode all local variables that can be shared in the parallel regions; are stored in the global memory. In `Cuda` mode local variables are not shared; between the threads and it is user responsibility to share the required data; between the threads in the parallel regions. Often, the optimizer is able to; reduce the cost of `Generic` mode to the level of `Cuda` mode, but the flag,; as well as other assumption flags, can be used for tuning. Features not supported or with limited support for Cuda devices; ---------------------------------------------------------------. - Cancellation constructs are not supported. - Doacross loop nest is not supported. - User-defined reductions are supported only for trivial types. - Nested parallelism: inner parallel regions are executed sequentially. - Debug information for OpenMP target regions is supported, but sometimes it may; be required to manually specify the address class of the inspected variables.; In some cases the local variables are actually allocated in the global memory,; but the de",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenMPSupport.rst:1777,variab,variables,1777,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenMPSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenMPSupport.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:. Global Variables; ----------------. Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time; instead of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`. Either global variable definitions or declarations may have an explicit section; to be placed in and may have an optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not.

This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============.

On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================. The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code with; GDB. This is due to MCJIT's ability to use the MC emitter to provide full; DWARF debugging information to GDB.

Binned pdfs shapes are fundamentally RooHistPdf and RooHistFuncs; (with interpolation order set to zero). Products and sums of exclusively binned shapes are also recognized; as binned shapes. For such binned shapes generate() will now by default follow the 'binned' strategy ; -- that is, take the expectation value in each bin and sample a Poisson distribution from that -- rather; than follow the unbinned strategy. The rationale is that such datasets result in much faster likelihood; calculations (for nbin smaller than nevent). The optimization is also exact: the likelihood of a binned ; data using a binned pdf is identical to that of an unbinned dataset with a binned pdf. Nevertheless you can ; switch off this feature by passing AutoBinned(false) to RooAbsPdf::generate(). Mixed binned/unbinned generation from simultaneous pdf.

The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23592,adapt,adapter,23592,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"ng the approach (2) - it should be possible to avoid; performance overhead, and clarity seems nice. **Gabor:**. At this point, I am a bit wondering about two questions. * When should something belong to a checker and when should something belong to the engine?; Sometimes we model library aspects in the engine and model language constructs in checkers. * What is the checker programming model that we are aiming for? Maximum freedom or more easy checker development?. I think if we aim for maximum freedom, we do not need to worry about the; potential stress on checkers, and we can introduce abstractions to mitigate that; later on.; If we want to simplify the API, then maybe it makes more sense to move language; construct modeling to the engine when the checker API is not sufficient instead; of complicating the API. Right now I have no preference or objections between the alternatives but there; are some random thoughts:. * Maybe it would be great to have a guideline how to evolve the analyzer and; follow it, so it can help us to decide in similar situations. * I do care about performance in this case. The reason is that we have a; limited performance budget. And I think we should not expect most of the checker; writers to add modeling of language constructs. So, in my opinion, it is ok to; have less nice/more verbose API for language modeling if we can have better; performance this way, since it only needs to be done once, and is done by the; framework developers. **Artem:** These are some great questions, i guess it'd be better to discuss; them more openly. As a quick dump of my current mood:. * To me it seems obvious that we need to aim for a checker API that is both; simple and powerful. This can probably by keeping the API as powerful as; necessary while providing a layer of simple ready-made solutions on top of it.; Probably a few reusable components for assembling checkers.

When using the minimal required interface, all variable parameters are; free and unbound. The user, in their $\mbox{FCN}$, must of course be able to ""see"" all; types of defined parameters, and they therefore have access to what we call; the *external parameter list*, that is, the parameters as he defined; them.

The transformation of course also affects the parameter error matrix, so; M does a transformation of the error matrix (and the ""parabolic""; parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users should however; realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that; it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very; close to a limit, where; $\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}} / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 0$.; Therefore, it is recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits; should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits.

In garbage collected environments, the ``__weak`` variable is set to; nil when the object it references is collected, as long as the; ``__block`` variable resides in the heap (either by default or via; ``Block_copy()``). The initial Apple implementation does in fact; start ``__block`` variables on the stack and migrate them to the heap; only as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. It is a runtime error to attempt to assign a reference to a; stack-based Block into any storage marked ``__weak``, including; ``__weak`` ``__block`` variables. C++ Extensions; ==============. Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in automatic storage. As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression. Captured variables in Blocks on the heap are destroyed; when the reference count of the Block drops to zero.

This layout is; described in a string where the layers are separated by semicolons.; The input/output layers are defined by giving the expression for each; neuron, separated by comas. Hidden layers are just described by the; number of neurons. In addition, input and output layer formulas can be preceded by '@'; (e.g. ""@out"") if one wants to normalize the corresponding value. Also,; if the string ends with '`!`', output neurons are set up for; classification, i.e. with a sigmoid (1 neuron) or softmax (more; neurons) activation function.

Variables, Types, and Scope; ===========================. Dereferencing; -------------. In CMake variables are ""stringly"" typed. All variables are represented as; strings throughout evaluation. Wrapping a variable in ``${}`` dereferences it; and results in a literal substitution of the name for the value. CMake refers to; this as ""variable evaluation"" in their documentation. Dereferences are performed; *before* the command being called receives the arguments. This means; dereferencing a list results in multiple separate arguments being passed to the; command. Variable dereferences can be nested and be used to model complex data. For; example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(var_name var1); set(${var_name} foo) # same as ""set(var1 foo)""; set(${${var_name}}_var bar) # same as ""set(foo_var bar)"". Dereferencing an unset variable results in an empty expansion. It is a common; pattern in CMake to conditionally set variables knowing that it will be used in; code paths that the variable isn't set. There are examples of this throughout; the LLVM CMake build system. An example of variable empty expansion is:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(APPLE); set(extra_sources Apple.cpp); endif(); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp ${extra_sources}). In this example the ``extra_sources`` variable is only defined if you're; targeting an Apple platform. For all other targets the ``extra_sources`` will be; evaluated as empty before add_executable is given its arguments. Lists; -----. In CMake lists are semi-colon delimited strings, and it is strongly advised that; you avoid using semi-colons in lists; it doesn't go smoothly. A few examples of; defining lists:. .. code-block:: cmake. # Creates a list with members a, b, c, and d; set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list ""a;b;c;d""). # Creates a string ""a b c d""; set(my_string ""a b c d"").

Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant.

Modifiability,"nk the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

Modifiability,"nny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers. Note that the ""sroa"" pass is; more powerful and can promote structs, ""unions"", and arrays in many; cases. All of these properties are easy to satisfy for most imperative; languages, and we'll illustrate it below with Kaleidoscope. The final; question you may be asking is: should I bother with this nonsense for my; front-end? Wouldn't it be better if I just did SSA construction; directly, avoiding use of the mem2reg optimization pass? In short, we; strongly recommend that you use this technique for building SSA form,; unless there is an extremely good reason not to. Using this technique; is:. - Proven and well tested: clang uses this technique; for local mutable variables. As such, the most common clients of LLVM; are using this to handle a bulk of their variables. You can be sure; that bugs are found fast and fixed early.; - Extremely Fast: mem2reg has a number of special cases that make it; fast in common cases as well as fully general. For example, it has; fast-paths for variables that are only used in a single block,; variables that only have one assignment point, good heuristics to; avoid insertion of unneeded phi nodes, etc.; - Needed for debug info generation: `Debug information in; LLVM <../../SourceLevelDebugging.html>`_ relies on having the address of; the variable exposed so that debug info can be attached to it. This; technique dovetails very naturally with this style of debug info. If nothing else, this makes it much easier to get your front-end up and; running, and is very simple to implement.

ARC must perform special operations when initializing an object and; when destroying it. In many common situations, ARC knows when an; object is created and when it is destroyed and can ensure that these; operations are performed correctly. Otherwise, however, ARC requires; programmer cooperation to establish its initialization invariants; because it is infeasible for ARC to dynamically infer whether they; are intact. For example, there is no syntactic difference in C between; an assignment that is intended by the programmer to initialize a variable; and one that is intended to replace the existing value stored there,; but ARC must perform one operation or the other. ARC chooses to always; assume that objects are initialized (except when it is in charge of; initializing them) because the only workable alternative would be to; ban all code patterns that could potentially be used to access; uninitialized memory, and that would be too limiting. In practice,; this is rarely a problem because programmers do not generally need to; work with objects for which the requirements are not handled; automatically.

The Loop Vectorizer uses a cost model to decide when it is profitable to unroll loops.; The decision to unroll the loop depends on the register pressure and the generated code size. Epilogue Vectorization; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When vectorizing a loop, often a scalar remainder (epilogue) loop is necessary; to execute tail iterations of the loop if the loop trip count is unknown or it; does not evenly divide the vectorization and unroll factors. When the; vectorization and unroll factors are large, it's possible for loops with smaller; trip counts to end up spending most of their time in the scalar (rather than; the vector) code. In order to address this issue, the inner loop vectorizer is; enhanced with a feature that allows it to vectorize epilogue loops with a; vectorization and unroll factor combination that makes it more likely for small; trip count loops to still execute in vectorized code. The diagram below shows; the CFG for a typical epilogue vectorized loop with runtime checks. As; illustrated the control flow is structured in a way that avoids duplicating the; runtime pointer checks and optimizes the path length for loops that have very; small trip counts. .. image:: epilogue-vectorization-cfg.png.

Modifiability,"ns `SetObjectFit/GetObjectFit` can be used inside the; `FCN` function to set/get a referenced object instead of using; global variables. - By default `fGraphicsMode` is true. When calling the `Minuit`; functions such as `mncont`, `mnscan`, or any `Minuit` command; invoking `mnplot`, `TMinuit::mnplot()` produces a **`TGraph`**; object pointed by `fPlot`. One can retrieve this object with; **`TMinuit`**`::GetPlot().` For example:. ``` {.cpp}; h->Fit(""gaus"");; gMinuit->Command(""SCAn 1"");; TGraph *gr = (TGraph*)gMinuit->GetPlot();; gr->SetMarkerStyle(21);; gr->Draw(""alp"");; ```. - To set `Minuit` in no graphics mode, call. ``` {.cpp}; gMinuit->SetGraphicsMode(kFALSE);; ```. ### Basic Concepts of Minuit. The `Minuit` package acts on a multi parameter FORTRAN function to; which one must give the generic name `FCN`. In the ROOT; implementation, the function `FCN` is defined via the `Minuit`; `SetFCN` member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The; value of `FCN` will in general depend on one or more variable; parameters. ### The Transformation of Limited Parameters. For variable parameters with limits, `Minuit` uses the following; transformation:. `Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1) `. `Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1)`. so that the internal value `Pint` can take on any value, while the; external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a; and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily; non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty; non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if; not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some; computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more; importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the; problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation; of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off; both become more important as the external value gets closer t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:55364,variab,variable,55364,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============. The compound statement of a Block is treated much like a function body; with respect to control flow in that goto, break, and continue do not; escape the Block.

OPTIONS:; -h - Alias for -help; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename. ... indicating that an input filename is expected. Boolean Arguments; -----------------. In addition to input and output filenames, we would like the compiler example to; support three boolean flags: ""``-f``"" to force writing binary output to a; terminal, ""``--quiet``"" to enable quiet mode, and ""``-q``"" for backwards; compatibility with some of our users. We can support these by declaring options; of boolean type like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Enable binary output on terminals""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet2(""q"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""), cl::Hidden);. This does what you would expect: it declares three boolean variables; (""``Force``"", ""``Quiet``"", and ""``Quiet2``"") to recognize these options. Note; that the ""``-q``"" option is specified with the ""`cl::Hidden`_"" flag. This; modifier prevents it from being shown by the standard ""``-help``"" output (note; that it is still shown in the ""``-help-hidden``"" output). The CommandLine library uses a `different parser`_ for different data types.; For example, in the string case, the argument passed to the option is copied; literally into the content of the string variable... we obviously cannot do that; in the boolean case, however, so we must use a smarter parser. In the case of; the boolean parser, it allows no options (in which case it assigns the value of; true to the variable), or it allows the values ""``true``"" or ""``false``"" to be; specified, allowing any of the following inputs:. ::. compiler -f # No value, 'Force' == true; compiler -f=true # Value specified, 'Force' == true; compiler -f=TRUE # Value specified, 'Force' == true; compiler -f=FALSE # Value spec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:9491,variab,variables,9491,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

However, Thread0 may call; another virtual member function virtual void `Myclass::Func0()` which; then can be overridden in a derived class of `Myclass`. (See example; `TMhs3`). Class `Myclass` may also provide a method to stop the running thread:. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t Myclass::Threadstop() {; if (mTh) {; TThread::Delete(mTh);; delete mTh;; mTh=0;; return 0;; }; return 1;; }; ```.

RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1.

At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization.

Modifiability,"nt of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others. C99 obviously does not specify the semantics of any of these; extensions, and the definition of i-c-e does not include them. However, these; extensions are often used in real code, and we have to have a way to reason; about them. Finally, this is not just a problem for semantic analysis. The code generator; and other clients have to be able to fold constants (e.g., to initialize global; variables) and have to handle a superset of what C99 allows. Further, these; clients can benefit from extended information. For example, we know that; ""``foo() || 1``"" always evaluates to ``true``, but we can't replace the; expression with ``true`` because it has side effects. Implementation Approach; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After trying several different approaches, we've finally converged on a design; (Note, at the time of this writing, not all of this has been implemented,; consider this a design goal!). Our basic approach is to define a single; recursive evaluation method (``Expr::Evaluate``), which is implemented; in ``AST/ExprConstant.cpp``. Given an expression with ""scalar"" type (integer,; fp, complex, or pointer) this method returns the following information:. * Whether the expression is an integer constant expression, a general constant; that was folded but has no side effects, a general constant that was folded; but that does have side effects, or an uncomputable/unfoldable value.; * If the expression was computable in any way, this method returns the; ``APValue`` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:120653,extend,extended,120653,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"nt to describe. The instance variables for an ARC-compiled class will be destroyed at some; point after control enters the ``dealloc`` method for the root class of the; class. The ordering of the destruction of instance variables is unspecified,; both within a single class and between subclasses and superclasses. .. admonition:: Rationale. The traditional, non-ARC pattern for destroying instance variables is to; destroy them immediately before calling ``[super dealloc]``. Unfortunately,; message sends from the superclass are quite capable of reaching methods in; the subclass, and those methods may well read or write to those instance; variables. Making such message sends from dealloc is generally discouraged,; since the subclass may well rely on other invariants that were broken during; ``dealloc``, but it's not so inescapably dangerous that we felt comfortable; calling it undefined behavior. Therefore we chose to delay destroying the; instance variables to a point at which message sends are clearly disallowed:; the point at which the root class's deallocation routines take over. In most code, the difference is not observable. It can, however, be observed; if an instance variable holds a strong reference to an object whose; deallocation will trigger a side-effect which must be carefully ordered with; respect to the destruction of the super class. Such code violates the design; principle that semantically important behavior should be explicit. A simple; fix is to clear the instance variable manually during ``dealloc``; a more; holistic solution is to move semantically important side-effects out of; ``dealloc`` and into a separate teardown phase which can rely on working with; well-formed objects. .. _arc.misc.autoreleasepool:. ``@autoreleasepool``; --------------------.

Flow Sequence; -------------; A YAML ""flow sequence"" is a sequence that when written to YAML it uses the; inline notation (e.g [ foo, bar ] ). To specify that a sequence type should; be written in YAML as a flow sequence, your SequenceTraits specialization should; add ""static const bool flow = true;"". For instance:. .. code-block:: c++. template <>; struct SequenceTraits<MyList> {; static size_t size(IO &io, MyList &list) { ... }; static MyListEl &element(IO &io, MyList &list, size_t index) { ... }. // The existence of this member causes YAML I/O to use a flow sequence; static const bool flow = true;; };. With the above, if you used MyList as the data type in your native data; structures, then when converted to YAML, a flow sequence of integers; will be used (e.g. [ 10, -3, 4 ]). Flow sequences are subject to line wrapping according to the Output object; configuration. Utility Macros; --------------; Since a common source of sequences is std::vector<>, YAML I/O provides macros:; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() and LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() which; can be used to easily specify SequenceTraits<> on a std::vector type. YAML; I/O does not partial specialize SequenceTraits on std::vector<> because that; would force all vectors to be sequences. An example use of the macros:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<MyType1>;; std::vector<MyType2>;; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType1); LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType2).

The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`.

Required passes will still be run on ``optnone`` functions. For more implementation details, see; ``PassInstrumentation::runBeforePass()``. Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Name##PluginInfo();``; - ``extern ""C"" ::llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo llvmGetPassPluginInfo() LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK;``. Pass plugins are compiled and linked dynamically by default. Setting; ``LLVM_${NAME}_LINK_INTO_TOOLS`` to ``ON`` turns the project into a statically; linked extension.

More complicated; structuring of source code into files is not supported. ; ; Also new accessors have been added for discrete-valued functions catfunc(); and stored category functions are now also printed under their own heading in Print(); Parameterized ranges. It is now possible to use RooAbsReal derived functions as range definition for variables; to construct ranges that vary as function of another variable. For example. RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; RooRealVar y(""y"",""y"",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; ; RooFormulaVar x_lo(""x_lo"",""y-20"",y) ; ; RooFormulaVar x_hi(""x_hi"",""sin(y)*5"",y) ; ; x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ; // Change x to have variable range depending on y; ; It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way. x.setRange(""signalRegion"",x_lo,x_hi) ;. There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges; that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables ; x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z; and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z); over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into; account.

In the special case where `s[j]` is zero, when there is only one entry; per bin, `e[j]` is computed from the average of the `s[j]` for all; bins. This approximation is used to keep the bin during a fit; operation. The **`TProfile`** constructor takes up to eight arguments.; The first five parameters are similar to **`TH1D`** constructor. ``` {.cpp}; TProfile(const char *name,const char *title,Int_t nbinsx,; Double_t xlow, Double_t xup, Double_t ylow, Double_t yup,; Option_t *option); ```. All values of `y` are accepted at filling time. To fill a profile; histogram, you must use **`TProfile`**`::Fill` function.

If a; minimum or maximum value is set for the Y scale before filling, then; all values below `ylow` or above `yup` will be discarded. Setting the; minimum or maximum value for the Y scale before filling has the same; effect as calling the special **`TProfile`** constructor above where; `ylow` and `yup` are specified. ### Build Options.

Prior to clang-16, the output may only be used safely when the indirect; branches are not taken. Query for this difference with; ``__has_extension(gnu_asm_goto_with_outputs_full)``. When using tied-outputs (i.e. outputs that are inputs and outputs, not just; outputs) with the `+r` constraint, there is a hidden input that's created; before the label, so numeric references to operands must account for that. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int x) {; // %0 and %1 both refer to x; // %l2 refers to err; asm goto(""# %0 %1 %l2"" : ""+r""(x) : : : err);; return x;; err:; return -1;; }.

Once a logging implementation has been initialized, it can be ""stopped"" by; finalizing the implementation through the ``__xray_log_finalize()`` function.; The finalization routine is the opposite of the initialization. When finalized,; an implementation's data can be cleared out through the; ``__xray_log_flushLog()`` function. For implementations that support in-memory; processing, these should register an iterator function to provide access to the; data via the ``__xray_log_set_buffer_iterator(...)`` which allows code calling; the ``__xray_log_process_buffers(...)`` function to deal with the data in; memory. All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end. Like all the other modes installed through ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``, the; implementation can be configured through the ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``; function, providing the mode string and the flag options. Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed.

To begin; a multi-line command you must type a single left curly bracket `{`,; and to end it you must type a single right curly bracket `}`.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] {; end with '}'> Int_t j = 0;; end with '}'> for (Int_t i = 0; i < 3; i++); end with '}'> {; end with '}'> j= j + i;; end with '}'> cout << ""i = "" << i << "", j = "" << j << endl;; end with '}'> }; end with '}'> }; i = 0, j = 0; i = 1, j = 1; i = 2, j = 3; ```. It is more convenient to edit a script than the command line, and if; your multi line commands are getting unmanageable, you may want to; start with a script instead. ### Cling Extensions. We should say that some things are not standard C++. The Cling; interpreter has several extensions. See ""ROOT/Cling Extensions to C++"". ### Helpful Hints for Command Line Typing. The interpreter knows all the classes, functions, variables, and user; defined types. This enables ROOT to help users to complete the command; line. For example, if we do not know anything about the **`TLine`**; class, the Tab feature helps us to get a list of all classes starting; with **`TL`**(where `<TAB>` means type the Tab key). ``` {.cpp}; root[] l = new TLi<TAB>; TList; TListIter; TLink; TLine; TLimitDataSource; TLimit; ```. To list the different constructors and parameters for **`TLine`** use; the `<TAB>` key as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] l = new TLine(<TAB>; TLine TLine(); TLine TLine(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2); TLine TLine(const TLine& line); ```. ### Regular Expression. The meta-characters below can be used in a regular expression:. - '`^`' start-of-line anchor. - '`$`' end-of-line anchor. - '`.`' matches any character. - '`[`' start a character class. - '`]`'end a character class. - '`^`'negates character class if first character. - '`*`'`Kleene` closure (matches 0 or more). - '`+`'Positive ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md:26726,variab,variables,26726,documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

The list of all operators supported in the `RModel` class is the one provided below for the ONNX parser. #### SOFIE-GNN; 1. The SOFIE-GNN implementation brought a major change in SOFIE's architecture. Instead of having only the RModel class to store model information, now SOFIE has RModel, RModel_GNN and RModel_GraphIndependent classes which are inherited from RModel_Base.; 2. **RModel_GNN** is used to store a GNN model having nodes, edges, and globals with functions for their update and aggregate(for inter-relationships).; 3. **RModel_GraphIndependent** is used to store an independent Graph model with nodes, edges and globals with their individual update functions.; 4. **RFunctions** are used to declare update/aggregate operations over graph components. Currently supported RFunctions include:; - **Update Functions**; - RFunction_MLP; - **Aggregate Functions**; - RFunction_Mean; - RFunction_Sum; 5. Pythonized functions for parsing a Graphnets' model can be used to generate inference code; ```; import graph_nets as gn; from graph_nets import utils_tf.

In this case the axis becomes alphanumeric and; there is no more relation to the observed quantities. Note that when an axis is alphanumeric the mean and the rms of the histograms are not anymore; coputed and they are set to zero. ### TH1. - The bit `TH1::kCanRebin` used to extend the histogram axes is now deprecated. The bit exists still in ROOT 6.0 but it has no effect.; One should use now the new function `TH1::SetCanExtend(..)` passing the axis (using the appropriate enumeration), which needs to be extended.; In addition to extend each axis individually, the function can be used also to enable/disable extension for all axes.; For example `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kXaxis)` will make extendable only the X axis; `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kAllAxes)` will; make extendable all the axes (this is the same functionality of the previous function `SetBit(TH1::kCanRebin)` and; `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kNoAxis)` will remove the extendable functionality to all the axes (equivalent to the old `ResetBit(TH1::kCanRebin)`).; The functionality of `TestBit(TH1::kCanRebin)` is now replaced by `TH1::CanExtendAllAxis()`. - An histogram filled with weights different than one has now automatically the sum of the weight squared stored inside, without the need to call anymore; `TH1::Sum",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/hist/doc/v600/index.md:7117,extend,extend,7117,hist/doc/v600/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/hist/doc/v600/index.md,1,['extend'],['extend']

The core of the minimization functionality and related tools (the kernel; of M ) should be clearly separated from the user, who is interfacing via; defined user interfaces (the API). ## Internal and external parameters ##. Each of the parameters to the $\mbox{FCN}$ is defined by the user as; belonging to one of the following types:. - Freely variable: allowed to take on any value. - Variable with double sided limits: allowed to vary only between two; limits specified by the user. - Variable with single sided limits: allowed to vary only between one; upper or one lower limit specified by the user and unlimited to the; other side. - Fixed: originally defined as variable, but now taking on only the; value the parameter had at the moment it was fixed, or a value later; assigned by the user. - Constant: taking on only one value as specified by the user.

The user, in their $\mbox{FCN}$, must of course be able to ""see"" all; types of defined parameters, and they therefore have access to what we call; the *external parameter list*, that is, the parameters as he defined; them.

ABI visibility and default annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Requiring ``-fbounds-safety`` adopters to add bounds annotations to all pointers; in the codebase would be a significant adoption burden. To avoid this and to; secure all pointers by default, ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds; annotations to pointer types.; Default annotations apply to pointer types of declarations. ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds annotations to pointer types used in; declarations. The default annotations are determined by the ABI visibility of; the pointer. A pointer type is ABI-visible if changing its size or; representation affects the ABI. For instance, changing the size of a type used; in a function parameter will affect the ABI and thus pointers used in function; parameters are ABI-visible pointers. On the other hand, changing the types of; local variables won't have such ABI implications. Hence, ``-fbounds-safety``; considers the outermost pointer types of local variables as non-ABI visible. The; rest of the pointers such as nested pointer types, pointer types of global; variables, struct fields, and function prototypes are considered ABI-visible. All ABI-visible pointers are treated as ``__single`` by default unless annotated; otherwise. This default both preserves ABI and makes these pointers safe by; default. This behavior can be controlled with macros, i.e.,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_*ATTR*()``, to set the default annotation for; ABI-visible pointers to be either ``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__indexable``, or ``__unsafe_indexable``. For instance,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_unsafe_indexable()`` will make all ABI-visible pointers; be ``__unsafe_indexable``. Non-ABI visible pointers — the outermost pointer; types of local variables — are ``__bidi_indexable`` by default, so that these; pointers have the bounds inform",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:20865,variab,variables,20865,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Live Intervals; --------------. Live Intervals are the ranges (intervals) where a variable is *live*. They are; used by some `register allocator`_ passes to determine if two or more virtual; registers which require the same physical register are live at the same point in; the program (i.e., they conflict). When this situation occurs, one virtual; register must be *spilled*. Live Variable Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first step in determining the live intervals of variables is to calculate; the set of registers that are immediately dead after the instruction (i.e., the; instruction calculates the value, but it is never used) and the set of registers; that are used by the instruction, but are never used after the instruction; (i.e., they are killed). Live variable information is computed for; each *virtual* register and *register allocatable* physical register; in the function. This is done in a very efficient manner because it uses SSA to; sparsely compute lifetime information for virtual registers (which are in SSA; form) and only has to track physical registers within a block. Before register; allocation, LLVM can assume that physical registers are only live within a; single basic block. This allows it to do a single, local analysis to resolve; physical register lifetimes within each basic block. If a physical register is; not register allocatable (e.g., a stack pointer or condition codes), it is not; tracked. Physical registers may be live in to or out of a function. Live in values are; typically arguments in registers. Live out values are typically return values in; registers. Live in values are marked as such, and are given a dummy ""defining""; instruction during live intervals analysis.

See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline.

Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached.

A set of classes implements curly or wavy poly-lines typically; used to draw Feynman diagrams. Amplitudes and wavelengths may be; specified in the constructors, via commands or interactively from; context menus. These classes are **`TCurlyLine`** and **`TCurlyArc`**.; These classes make use of **`TPolyLine`** by inheritance; `ExecuteEvent`; methods are highly inspired from the methods used in **`TPolyLine`** and; **`TArc`**. ![The picture generated by the tutorial macro; feynman.C](pictures/030000B4.png).

The coordinates `(x1`, `y1)` define the starting point, `(x2`, `y2)` -; the end-point. The `wavelength` and the `amplitude` are given in percent; of the pad height. The **`TCurlyArc`** constructor is:. ``` {.cpp}; TCurlyArc(Double_t x1, Double_t y1, Double_t rad,; Double_t phimin, Double_t phimax,; Double_t wavelength, Double_t amplitude); ```. The curly arc center is `(x1`, `y1)` and the radius is `rad`.

Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the chance to operate on the value, e.g. to retain it, before; ARC releases the original pointer. Note again, however, that; dependence does not survive a store, so ARC does not guarantee the; continued validity of the return value past the end of the; full-expression. .. _arc.optimization.object_lifetime:. No object lifetime extension; ----------------------------. If, in the formal computation history of the program, an object ``X``; has been deallocated by the time of an observable side-effect, then; ARC must cause ``X`` to be deallocated by no later than the occurrence; of that side-effect, except as influenced by the re-ordering of the; destruction of objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:. Precise lifetime semantics; --------------------------. In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer held in; a ``__strong`` object will be retained for the full formal lifetime of the; object. Objects subject to this invariant have :arc-term:`precise lifetime; semantics`. By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do not have precise; lifetime semantics.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:82874,extend,extending,82874,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['extend'],['extending']

Instantiating the following classes and even including their header files is deprecated, and the headers will be removed in ROOT 6.34:. * RooAbsTestStatistic; * RooAbsOptTestStatistic; * RooNLLVar; * RooChi2Var; * RooXYChi2Var. Please use the higher-level functions `RooAbsPdf::createNLL()` and `RooAbsPdf::createChi2()` if you want to create objects that represent test statistics. ### Change of RooParamHistFunc. The `RooParamHistFunc` didn't take any observable `RooRealVar` as constructor; argument. It assumes as observable the internal variables in the passed; RooDataHist. This means it was in most contexts unusable, because the input; can't be changed, other than loading a different bin in the dataset. Furthermore, there was actually a constructor that took a `RooAbsArg x`, but it; was simply ignored. To fix all these problems, the existing constructors were replaced by a new one; that takes the observable explicitly. Since the old constructors resulted in wrong computation graphs that caused; trouble with the new CPU evaluation backend, they had to be removed without; deprecation. Please adapt your code if necessary. ### Renaming of some RooFit classes. The `RooPower` was renamed to `RooPowerSum`, and `RooExpPoly` was renamed to `RooLegacyExpPoly`. This was a necessary change, because the names of these classes introduced in ROOT 6.28 collided with some classes in CMS combine, which were around already long before.

NOTE: The fact that bindings are stored as a base region plus an offset limits; the Default Binding strategy, because in C aggregates can contain other; aggregates. In the current implementation of RegionStore, there is no way to; distinguish a Default binding for an entire aggregate from a Default binding; for the sub-aggregate at offset 0. Lazy Bindings (LazyCompoundVal); -------------------------------. RegionStore implements an optimization for copying aggregates (structs and; arrays) called ""lazy bindings"", implemented using a special SVal called; LazyCompoundVal. When the store is asked for the ""binding"" for an entire; aggregate (i.e. for an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion), it returns a; LazyCompoundVal instead. When this value is then stored into a variable, it is; bound as a Default value. This makes copying arrays and structs much cheaper; than if they had required memberwise access. Under the hood, a LazyCompoundVal is implemented as a uniqued pair of (region,; store), representing ""the value of the region during this 'snapshot' of the; store"". This has important implications for any sort of liveness or; reachability analysis, which must take the bindings in the old store into; account. Retrieving a value from a lazy binding happens in the same way as any other; Default binding: since there is no direct binding, the store manager falls back; to super-regions to look for an appropriate default binding. LazyCompoundVal; differs from a normal default binding, however, in that it contains several; different values, instead of one value that will appear several times. Because; of this, the store manager has to reconstruct the subregion chain on top of the; LazyCompoundVal region, and look up *that* region in the previous store.

EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them to the multilib system.; To see what flags are emitted for a given set of command line options, use; the ``-print-multi-flags-experimental`` command line option; along with the rest of the options you want to use.; #. Load ``multilib.yaml`` from sysroot.; #. Generate additional flags. ``multilib.yaml`` contains a ``Mappings`` section,; which specifies how to generate additional flags based on the flags derived; from command line options.

I think it's fine for a; FunctionDecl's body in a body farm to have a local variable, even if such; variable doesn't actually exist, even if it cannot be seen from outside the; function call.

This is our overall problem with C++ constructors, which manifests in; this case as well. Additionally, objects would need to be constructed in the; analyzer's core, which would not be able to predict that it needs to take a; checker-specific region as this-region, which makes it harder, though it might; be mitigated by sharing the checker state traits. * Because ""ghost variables"" are not material to the user, we need to somehow; make super sure that they don't make it into the diagnostic messages.

I'd like to write a self-hosting LLVM compiler. How should I interface with the LLVM middle-end optimizers and back-end code generators?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; Your compiler front-end will communicate with LLVM by creating a module in the; LLVM intermediate representation (IR) format. Assuming you want to write your; language's compiler in the language itself (rather than C++), there are 3; major ways to tackle generating LLVM IR from a front-end:. 1. **Call into the LLVM libraries code using your language's FFI (foreign; function interface).**. * *for:* best tracks changes to the LLVM IR, .ll syntax, and .bc format. * *for:* enables running LLVM optimization passes without a emit/parse; overhead. * *for:* adapts well to a JIT context. * *against:* lots of ugly glue code to write. 2. **Emit LLVM assembly from your compiler's native language.**. * *for:* very straightforward to get started. * *against:* the .ll parser is slower than the bitcode reader when; interfacing to the middle end. * *against:* it may be harder to track changes to the IR. 3. **Emit LLVM bitcode from your compiler's native language.**. * *for:* can use the more-efficient bitcode reader when interfacing to the; middle end. * *against:* you'll have to re-engineer the LLVM IR object model and bitcode; writer in your language. * *against:* it may be harder to track changes to the IR. If you go with the first option, the C bindings in include/llvm-c should help; a lot, since most languages have strong support for interfacing with C.

Cocoa frameworks frequently define constant values using *enums.*; Although enum values are integral, they may not be used directly as; boxed literals (this avoids conflicts with future ``'@'``-prefixed; Objective-C keywords). Instead, an enum value must be placed inside a; boxed expression. The following example demonstrates configuring an; ``AVAudioRecorder`` using a dictionary that contains a boxed enumeration; value:. .. code-block:: objc. enum {; AVAudioQualityMin = 0,; AVAudioQualityLow = 0x20,; AVAudioQualityMedium = 0x40,; AVAudioQualityHigh = 0x60,; AVAudioQualityMax = 0x7F; };. - (AVAudioRecorder *)recordToFile:(NSURL *)fileURL {; NSDictionary *settings = @{ AVEncoderAudioQualityKey : @(AVAudioQualityMax) };; return [[AVAudioRecorder alloc] initWithURL:fileURL settings:settings error:NULL];; }. The expression ``@(AVAudioQualityMax)`` converts ``AVAudioQualityMax``; to an integer type, and boxes the value accordingly.

Refer to the; [address sanitizer documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or use `ASAN_OPTIONS=help=1` when starting; up a sanitised executable (e.g. `root.exe`). A template for a leak suppression file can be found in `$ROOTSYS/etc/lsan-root.supp`. ## Create your own sanitised executable; ROOT exports a library target called `ROOT::ROOTStaticSanitizerConfig` that can be used to create sanitised executables with ROOT's default; address sanitizer config.

It should be sufficient to; - Link all executables against this target; - And have `-fsanitize=address` in the `CXXFLAGS`. ## Use sanitised ROOT libraries from a non-sanitised executable (e.g. `python`); When ROOT libraries are built with sanitizers, the address sanitizer runtime needs to be loaded at startup. However, when calling into ROOT; functions from python, that won't happen, since python is not sanitised. Therefore, the address sanitizer runtime has to be preloaded with; `LD_PRELOAD=<pathToRuntime>:libROOTSanitizerConfig.<so|dylib> pythonX ROOTScript.py`.

Modifiability,"o guide our design of the lattice and transfer; functions: lattice values can be symbolic expressions, and transfer functions; can construct more complex symbolic expressions from symbolic expressions that; represent arguments. See [this StackOverflow; discussion](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19708/symbolic-execution-is-a-case-of-abstract-interpretation); for a further comparison of abstract interpretation and symbolic execution. ### Flow condition. A human can say about the previous example that the function returns `x` when; `x >= 0`, and `-x` when `x < 0`. We can make this conclusion programmatically by; tracking a flow condition. A flow condition is a predicate written in terms of; the program state that is true at a specific program point regardless of the; execution path that led to this statement. For example, the flow condition for; the program point right before evaluating `result = x` is `x >= 0`. If we enhance the lattice to be a set of pairs of values and predicates, the; dataflow analysis computes the following values:. ```c++; void PrintAbs(int x) {; int result;; if (x >= 0) {; // Flow condition: x >= 0.; result = x; // result is {x if x >= 0}; } else {; // Flow condition: x < 0.; result = -x; // result is {-x if x < 0}; }; print(result); // result is {x if x >= 0; -x if x < 0}; }; ```. Of course, in a program with loops, symbolic expressions for flow conditions can; grow unbounded. A practical static analysis system must control this growth to; keep the symbolic representations manageable and ensure that the data flow; analysis terminates. For example, it can use a constraint solver to prune; impossible flow conditions, and/or it can abstract them, losing precision, after; their symbolic representations grow beyond some threshold. This is similar to; how we had to limit the sizes of computed sets of possible values to 3 elements. ### Symbolic pointers.

The Cling library (`libCling.so`) is also needed in all ROOT; applications, and even by `libCore`. A; program referencing only **`TObject`** only needs `libCore`;; `libCling` will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write; ROOT objects one also has to load `libRIO`. As one would expect, none of that; depends on graphics or the GUI. Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether; you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is; defined in a library. #### Linktime Library Dependencies. When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:17355,config,config,17355,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,2,['config'],['config']

This transform is designed to eliminate unreachable internal globals from the; program. It uses an aggressive algorithm, searching out globals that are known; to be alive.

Modifiability,"o perform these refactorings. Certain; refactorings are also available in other clients like text editors and IDEs. A refactoring action is a class that defines a list of related refactoring; operations (rules). These rules are grouped under a common umbrella - a single; ``clang-refactor`` command. In addition to rules, the refactoring action; provides the action's command name and description to ``clang-refactor``.; Each action must implement the ``RefactoringAction`` interface. Here's an; outline of a ``local-rename`` action:. .. code-block:: c++. class LocalRename final : public RefactoringAction {; public:; StringRef getCommand() const override { return ""local-rename""; }.

Refactoring Action Rules; ------------------------. An individual refactoring action is responsible for creating the set of; grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.; Although the rules in one action may have a number of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result. It should be easy for users to; identify which refactoring action produced the result regardless of which; refactoring action rule was used. The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of actions; that define a set of different rules that produce similar results. For example,; the ""add missing switch cases"" refactoring operation typically adds missing; cases to one switch at a time. However, it could be useful to have a; refactoring that works on all switches that operate on a particular enum, as; one could then automatically update all of them after adding a new enum; constant. To achieve that, we can create two different rules that will use one; ``clang-refactor`` subcommand.

It is also very easy to accidentally forget; to drain an autorelease pool when using the manual API, and this can; significantly inflate the process's high-water-mark. The introduction of a; new scope is unfortunate but basically required for sane interaction with the; rest of the language. Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation. This means that the variable is; retained elsewhere, and therefore the implementation can elide retaining and; releasing its value. Such a variable is implicitly ``const`` for safety. In; contrast with ``__unsafe_unretained``, an externally-retained variable still; behaves as a strong variable outside of initialization and destruction. For; instance, when an externally-retained variable is captured in a block the value; of the variable is retained and released on block capture and destruction. It; also affects C++ features such as lambda capture, ``decltype``, and template; argument deduction. Implicitly, the implementation assumes that the :ref:`self parameter in a; non-init method <arc.misc.self>` and the :ref:`variable in a for-in loop; <arc.misc.enumeration>` are externally-retained. Externally-retained semantics can also be opted into with the; ``objc_externally_retained`` attribute. This attribute can apply to strong local; variables, functions, methods, or blocks:. .. code-block:: objc. @class WobbleAmount;. @interface Widget : NSObject; -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount *)amount;; @end. @implementation Widget. -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount *)amount; __attribute__((objc_externally_retained)) {; // 'amount' and 'alias' aren't retained on entr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:92373,variab,variable,92373,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,2,['variab'],['variable']

The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons. This syntax has a few advantages:. - It is impossible for ``%{name}`` to contain sequences that are special in; python's ``re.sub`` patterns. Otherwise, attempting to specify; ``%{name}`` as a substitution pattern in a lit configuration file could; produce confusing expansions.; - The braces help avoid the possibility that another substitution's pattern; will match part of ``%{name}`` or vice-versa, producing confusing; expansions. However, the patterns of substitutions defined by lit; configuration files and by lit itself are not restricted to this form, so; overlaps are still theoretically possible. - **Substitution value**: The value includes all text from the first; non-whitespace character after ``=`` to the last non-whitespace character. If; there is no non-whitespace character after ``=``, the value is the empty; string. Escape sequences that can appear in python ``re.sub`` replacement; strings are treated as plain text in the value.; - **Line continuations**: If the last non-whitespace character on the line after; ``:`` is ``\``, then the next directive must use the same directive keyword; (e.g., ``DEFINE:``) , and it is an error if there is no additional directive.; That directive serves as a continuation. That is, before following the rules; above to parse the text after ``:`` in either directive, lit joins that text; together to form a single directive, replaces the ``\`` with a single space,; and removes any other whitespace that is now adjacent to that space.

When the `Streamer `comes across a pointer to a simple type, it assumes; it is an array. Somehow, it has to know how many elements are in the; array to reserve enough space in the buffer and write out the; appropriate number of elements. This is done in the class definition.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; ...; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; ```. The array `fClosestDistance` is defined as a pointer of floating point; numbers. A comment mark (//), and the number in square brackets tell the; `Streamer `the length of the array for this object. In general the; syntax is:. ``` {.cpp}; <simple type> *<name>//[<length>]; ```. The length cannot be an expression. If a variable is used, it needs to; be an integer data member of the class. It must be defined ahead of its; use, or in a base class. The same notation also applies to variable length array of object and; variable length array of pointer to objects. ``` {.cpp}; MyObject *obj; //[fNojbs]; MyObject **objs; //[fDatas]; ```. ### Double32\_t. Math operations very often require double precision, but on saving; single usually precision is sufficient. For this purpose we support the; typedef Double32\_t which is stored in memory as a double and on disk as; a float or integer. The actual size of disk (before compression) is; determined by the parameter next to the data member declaration. For; example:. ``` {.cpp}; Double32_t m_data; //[min,max<,nbits>]; ```. If the comment is absent or does not contain `min`, `max`,; `nbits`, the member is saved as a `float`. If `min` and `max` are present, they are saved with 32 bits precision.; `min` and `max` can be explicit values or expressions of values known; to Cling (e.g. `pi`).

Modifiability,"o-called active pad. For; every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad,; whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called; ***`gPad`***. It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to; change the fill color of the active pad to blue but you do not know its; name, do this. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetFillColor(38); ```. To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph ""Color and color; palettes"" or if you have an opened canvas, click on the `View` menu,; selecting the `Colors` item. #### Finding an Object in a Pad. Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, ***`gPad`*** and that we; know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to; access one of those objects. The method `GetPrimitive()` of **`TPad`**,; i.e. `TPad::GetPrimitive(const char* name)` does exactly this. Since; most of the objects that a pad contains derive from **`TObject`**, they; have a name. The following statement will return a pointer to the object; `myobjectname` and put that pointer into the variable `obj`. As you can; see, the type of returned pointer is `TObject*`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj = gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname""); (class TObject*)0x1063cba8; ```. Even if your object is something more complicated, like a histogram; **`TH1F`**, this is normal. A function cannot return more than one type.; So the one chosen was the lowest common denominator to all possible; classes, the class from which everything derives, **`TObject`**. How do; we get the right pointer then? Simply do a cast of the function output; that will transform the output (pointer) into the right type. For; example if the object is a **`TPaveLabel`**:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj = (TPaveLabel*)(gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname"")); (class TPaveLabel*)0x1063cba8; ```. This works for all objects deriving from **`TObject`**. However, a; question remains. An object has a name if it derives from **`TNamed`**,; not from **`TObject`**.

This gives the language a very nice elegance, because; only supporting one type means that you never have to specify types.; Different languages have different ways of handling this. The easiest; way is to require the user to specify types for every variable; definition, and record the type of the variable in the symbol table; along with its Value\*.; - **arrays, structs, vectors, etc** - Once you add types, you can start; extending the type system in all sorts of interesting ways. Simple; arrays are very easy and are quite useful for many different; applications.

The following; basic random distributions are provided: `Rndm()` or; `Uniform(min,max)`, `Gaus(mean,sigma)`, `Exp(tau)`,; `BreitWigner(mean,sigma)`, `Landau(mean,sigma)`, `Poisson(mean)`,; `Binomial(ntot,prob)`.

For; example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete gRandom;; root[] gRandom = new TRandom2(0); //seed=0; ```. **`TRandom2`** is another generator, which is also very fast and uses; only three words for its state. ### gEnv. **`gEnv`** is the global variable (of type **`TEnv`**) with all the; environment settings for the current session.

While in; a session, to see current settings, you can do:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gEnv->Print(); ```.

If you are writing an analysis or any other pass that retains a significant; amount of state (for use by another pass which ""requires"" your pass and uses; the :ref:`getAnalysis <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysis>` method) you should; implement ``releaseMemory`` to, well, release the memory allocated to maintain; this internal state.

You want to be able to do all this, and, provide; feedback to the user. This is where pass registration comes into play. The fundamental mechanisms for pass registration are the; ``MachinePassRegistry`` class and subclasses of ``MachinePassRegistryNode``. An instance of ``MachinePassRegistry`` is used to maintain a list of; ``MachinePassRegistryNode`` objects. This instance maintains the list and; communicates additions and deletions to the command line interface. An instance of ``MachinePassRegistryNode`` subclass is used to maintain; information provided about a particular pass. This information includes the; command line name, the command help string and the address of the function used; to create an instance of the pass.

The stage1; compiler is a balance of optimization vs build time because it is a throwaway.; The stage2 compiler is the fully optimized compiler intended to ship to users. Setting up these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations.

Generating LLVM code for expression nodes is very straightforward: less; than 45 lines of commented code for all four of our expression nodes.; First we'll do numeric literals:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *NumberExprAST::codegen() {; return ConstantFP::get(*TheContext, APFloat(Val));; }. In the LLVM IR, numeric constants are represented with the; ``ConstantFP`` class, which holds the numeric value in an ``APFloat``; internally (``APFloat`` has the capability of holding floating point; constants of Arbitrary Precision). This code basically just creates; and returns a ``ConstantFP``. Note that in the LLVM IR that constants; are all uniqued together and shared. For this reason, the API uses the; ""foo::get(...)"" idiom instead of ""new foo(..)"" or ""foo::Create(..)"". .. code-block:: c++. Value *VariableExprAST::codegen() {; // Look this variable up in the function.; Value *V = NamedValues[Name];; if (!V); LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");; return V;; }. References to variables are also quite simple using LLVM. In the simple; version of Kaleidoscope, we assume that the variable has already been; emitted somewhere and its value is available. In practice, the only; values that can be in the ``NamedValues`` map are function arguments.; This code simply checks to see that the specified name is in the map (if; not, an unknown variable is being referenced) and returns the value for; it. In future chapters, we'll add support for `loop induction; variables <LangImpl05.html#for-loop-expression>`_ in the symbol table, and for `local; variables <LangImpl07.html#user-defined-local-variables>`_. .. code-block:: c++.

In many cases, while debugging various parts of the; compiler, it is nice to instantly visualize these graphs. LLVM provides several callbacks that are available in a debug build to do; exactly that.

This document describes the mechanism by which an LLVM based compiler; can provide this information to a language runtime/collector, and; ensure that all pointers can be read and updated if desired. Abstract Machine Model; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. At a high level, LLVM has been extended to support compiling to an abstract; machine which extends the actual target with a non-integral pointer type; suitable for representing a garbage collected reference to an object. In; particular, such non-integral pointer type have no defined mapping to an; integer representation. This semantic quirk allows the runtime to pick a; integer mapping for each point in the program allowing relocations of objects; without visible effects. This high level abstract machine model is used for most of the optimizer. As; a result, transform passes do not need to be extended to look through explicit; relocation sequence. Before starting code generation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa.

Modifiability,"of a cluster size for the TTree. The TTreeCache; prefilling is also enabled by default; when in learning phase rather than; reading each requested branch individually, the TTreeCache will read all the; branches thus trading off the latencies inherent to multiple small reads for; the potential of requesting more data than needed by read from the disk or; server the baskets for too many branches. The default behavior can be changed by either updating one of the rootrc files; or by setting environment variables. The rootrc files, both the global and the; local ones, now support the following the resource variable TTreeCache.Size; which set the default size factor for auto sizing TTreeCache for TTrees. The; estimated cluster size for the TTree and this factor is used to give the cache; size. If option is set to zero auto cache creation is disabled and the default; cache size is the historical one (equivalent to factor 1.0). If set to; non zero auto cache creation is enabled and both auto created and; default sized caches will use the configured factor: 0.0 no automatic cache; and greater than 0.0 to enable cache. This value can be overridden by the; environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE. The resource variable TTreeCache.Prefill sets the default TTreeCache prefilling; type. The prefill type may be: 0 for no prefilling and 1 to prefill all; the branches. It can be overridden by the environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_PREFILL. In particular the default can be set back to the same as in version 5 by; setting TTreeCache.Size (or ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE) and TTreeCache.Prefill; (or ROOT_TTREECACHE_PREFILL) both to zero. TTree methods which are expected to modify a cache, like AddBranchToCache, will; attempt to setup a cache of default size if one does not exist, irrespective of; whether the auto cache creation is enabled.

Modifiability,"of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result. It should be easy for users to; identify which refactoring action produced the result regardless of which; refactoring action rule was used. The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of actions; that define a set of different rules that produce similar results. For example,; the ""add missing switch cases"" refactoring operation typically adds missing; cases to one switch at a time. However, it could be useful to have a; refactoring that works on all switches that operate on a particular enum, as; one could then automatically update all of them after adding a new enum; constant. To achieve that, we can create two different rules that will use one; ``clang-refactor`` subcommand. The first rule will describe a local operation; that's initiated when the user selects a single switch. The second rule will; describe a global operation that works across translation units and is initiated; when the user provides the name of the enum to clang-refactor (or the user could; select the enum declaration instead). The clang-refactor tool will then analyze; the selection and other options passed to the refactoring action, and will pick; the most appropriate rule for the given selection and other options. Rule Types; ^^^^^^^^^^. Clang's refactoring engine supports several different refactoring rules:. - ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` produces source replacements that are applied; to the source files. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to; implement the ``createSourceReplacements`` member function. This type of; rule is typically used to implement local refactorings that transform the; source in one translation unit only. - ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` produces a ""partial"" refactoring; result: a set of occurrences that refer to a particular symbol. This type; of rule is typically used to implement an interactive renaming action that; allows users to specify w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst:3382,refactor,refactor,3382,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

It will allocate; an array of the length $nrow*(nrow+1)/2$ and initialize it to $0$.; Elements can then be set using the method operator()(unsigned int,; unsigned int). ### MnUserCovariance::operator()(unsigned int, unsigned int) ###. Individual elements can be accessed via the operator(), both for reading; and writing. ## MnUserParameters ##. [api:parameters] MnUserParameters is the main class for user interaction; with the parameters. It serves both as input to the minimization as well; as output as the result of the minimization is converted into the user; representable format in order to allow for further interaction.; Parameters for M can be added (defined) specifying a name, value and; initial uncertainty. ### add(...) ###. The method MnUserParameters::add(...) is overloaded for three kind of; parameters:. - add(const char\*, double, double) for adding a free variable; parameter. - add(const char\*, double, double, double, double) for adding a; variable parameter with limits (lower and upper). - add(const char\*, double) for adding a constant parameter. When adding parameters, M assigns indices to each parameter which will; be the same as in the std::vector$<$double$>$ in the; FCNBase::operator(). That means the first parameter the user adds gets; index 0, the second index 1, and so on. When calculating the function; value inside FCN, M will call FCNBase::operator() with the elements at; their positions. ### setValue(...) ###.

Modifiability,"of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`. Either global variable definitions or declarations may have an explicit section; to be placed in and may have an optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:31451,variab,variables,31451,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries. This; option should not be used if your distribution includes static archives, as the; objects inside the archive will be LLVM bitcode, which is not portable. The :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` documentation describes the built-in tooling for; generating LLVM profiling information to drive Profile-Guided-Optimization. The; in-tree profiling tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic.

Modifiability,"of the more important tools. However, it should be noted that this; document is currently focused on Clang and Clang Tool developers, not on; end users of these tools. Clang Tools Organization; ========================. Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly; used by C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by; Clang developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers; who happen to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their; functionality. They are developed in three components: the underlying; infrastructure for building a standalone tool based on Clang, core; shared logic used by many different tools in the form of refactoring and; rewriting libraries, and the tools themselves. The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the; :doc:`LibTooling <LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much; more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The; common refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of; LibTooling organizationally. A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as; examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of; the tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation; from the core libraries. We intentionally do not support public; libraries in the side repository, as we want to carefully review and; find good APIs for libraries as they are lifted out of a few tools and; into the core Clang library set. Regardless of which repository Clang Tools' code resides in, the; development process and practices for all Clang Tools are exactly those; of Clang itself. They are entirely within the Clang *project*,; regardless of the version control scheme. Core Clang Tools; ================. The core set of Clang tools that are within the main repository are; tools that very specifically complement, and allow use and testing of; *Clang* specific functionality. ``clang-check``; ---------------. :d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst:1667,refactor,refactoring,1667,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

Modifiability,"of the; Kaleidoscope REPL from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a; language in LLVM tutorial"". Finally, a word on API generations: ORC is the 3rd generation of LLVM JIT API.; It was preceded by MCJIT, and before that by the (now deleted) legacy JIT.; These tutorials don't assume any experience with these earlier APIs, but; readers acquainted with them will see many familiar elements. Where appropriate; we will make this connection with the earlier APIs explicit to help people who; are transitioning from them to ORC. JIT API Basics; ==============. The purpose of a JIT compiler is to compile code ""on-the-fly"" as it is needed,; rather than compiling whole programs to disk ahead of time as a traditional; compiler does. To support that aim our initial, bare-bones JIT API will have; just two functions:. 1. ``Error addModule(std::unique_ptr<Module> M)``: Make the given IR module; available for execution.; 2. ``Expected<ExecutorSymbolDef> lookup()``: Search for pointers to; symbols (functions or variables) that have been added to the JIT. A basic use-case for this API, executing the 'main' function from a module,; will look like:. .. code-block:: c++. JIT J;; J.addModule(buildModule());; auto *Main = J.lookup(""main"").getAddress().toPtr<int(*)(int, char *[])>();; int Result = Main();. The APIs that we build in these tutorials will all be variations on this simple; theme. Behind this API we will refine the implementation of the JIT to add; support for concurrent compilation, optimization and lazy compilation.; Eventually we will extend the API itself to allow higher-level program; representations (e.g. ASTs) to be added to the JIT. KaleidoscopeJIT; ===============. In the previous section we described our API, now we examine a simple; implementation of it: The KaleidoscopeJIT class [1]_ that was used in the; `Implementing a language with LLVM <LangImpl01.html>`_ tutorials.

All collection classes inherit from **`TCollection`** and hence inherit; the **`TCollection::Write()` method. When you call; `TCollection`**`::Write()` each object in the container is written; individually into its own key in the file. To write all objects into one; key you can specify the name of the key and use the; option` TObject::kSingleKey`. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TList * list = new TList;; root[] TNamed * n1, * n2;; root[] n1 = new TNamed(""name1"",""title1"");; root[] n2 = new TNamed(""name2"",""title2"");; root[] list->Add(n1);; root[] list->Add(n2);; root[] gFile->WriteObject(list,""list"",TObject::kSingleKey);; ```. ### A TFile Object Going Out of Scope. There is another important point to remember about `TFile::Close` and; **`TFile::Write`**. When a variable is declared on the stack in a function; such as in the code below, it will be deleted when it goes out of; scope. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; }; ```. As soon as the function `foo `has finished executing, the variable `f`; is deleted. When a **`TFile`** object is deleted an implicit call to; `TFile::Close` is made. This will save only the file descriptor to disk.; It contains the file header, the `StreamerInfo `list, the key list, the; free segment list, and the end address. See ""The Physical Layout of ROOT; Files"". The `TFile::Close` does not make a call to `Write()`, which; means that the objects in memory will not be saved in the file. You need; to explicitly call `TFile::Write()` to save the object in memory to file; before the exit of the function. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; ... stuff ...; f.Write();; }; ```.

If you want more control over how the tests are run, it may; be convenient to run the test harness on the command-line directly. Before; running tests from the command line, you will need to ensure that; lit.site.cfg files have been created for your build. You can do; this by running the tests as described in the previous sections. Once the; tests have started running, you can stop them with control+C, as the; files are generated before running any tests.; Once that is done, to run all the tests from the command line,; execute a command like the following:. python (path to llvm)\llvm\utils\lit\lit.py -sv; --param=build_mode=Win32 --param=build_config=Debug; --param=clang_site_config=(build dir)\tools\clang\test\lit.site.cfg; (path to llvm)\llvm\tools\clang\test.

It is possible to put; ORC components together to make a non-lazy, in-process, single threaded JIT; or a lazy, out-of-process, concurrent JIT, or anything in between. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT; ===================. ORC provides two basic JIT classes off-the-shelf. These are useful both as; examples of how to assemble ORC components to make a JIT, and as replacements; for earlier LLVM JIT APIs (e.g. MCJIT). The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.takeError();. // Add the module.; if (auto Err = JIT->addIRModule(TheadSafeModule(std::move(M), Ctx))); return Err;. // Look up the JIT'd code entry point.; auto EntrySym = JIT->lookup(""entry"");; if (!EntrySym); return EntrySym.takeError();. // Cast the entry point address to a function pointer.; auto *Entry",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:4236,extend,extends,4236,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['extend'],['extends']

When ``typeof()`` takes an expression, it respects the bounds annotation on; the expression type, including the bounds annotation is implcit. For example,; the global variable ``g`` in the following code is implicitly ``__single`` so; ``typeof(g)`` gets ``char *__single``.

The **`TTree`** gets its attributes from; the current **`TStyle`** at the time it was created. You can call the; method `TTree::UseCurrentStyle` to change to the current style rather; than the **`TTree`** style. (See ***`gStyle`***; see also ""Graphics and; the Graphical User Interface"" ). In the next segment, we activate the second pad and draw a scatter plot; variables:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] myCanvas->cd(2); root[] MyTree->Draw(""Cost:Age""); ```. This signature still only has one parameter, but it now has two; dimensions separated by a colon `(""x:y"")`. The item to be plotted can be; an expression not just a simple variable. In general, this parameter is; a string that contains up to three expressions, one for each dimension,; separated by a colon (""`e1:e2:e3`"").

DWARF specifies three kinds of simple location descriptions: Register, memory,; and implicit location descriptions. Note that a location description is; defined over certain ranges of a program, i.e the location of a variable may; change over the course of the program. Register and memory location; descriptions describe the *concrete location* of a source variable (in the; sense that a debugger might modify its value), whereas *implicit locations*; describe merely the actual *value* of a source variable which might not exist; in registers or in memory (see ``DW_OP_stack_value``). A ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic describes an indirect value (the address) of a; source variable. The first operand of the intrinsic must be an address of some; kind. A DIExpression attached to the intrinsic refines this address to produce a; concrete location for the source variable. A ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic describes the direct value of a source variable.; The first operand of the intrinsic may be a direct or indirect value.

Not all sub-projects are used for building toolchains.; For example, www/ and test-suite/ are not part of the monorepo. Putting all sub-projects in a single checkout makes cross-project refactoring; naturally simple:. * New sub-projects can be trivially split out for better reuse and/or layering; (e.g., to allow libSupport and/or LIT to be used by runtimes without adding a; dependency on LLVM).; * Changing an API in LLVM and upgrading the sub-projects will always be done in; a single commit, designing away a common source of temporary build breakage.; * Moving code across sub-project (during refactoring for instance) in a single; commit enables accurate `git blame` when tracking code change history.; * Tooling based on `git grep` works natively across sub-projects, allowing to; easier find refactoring opportunities across projects (for example reusing a; datastructure initially in LLDB by moving it into libSupport).; * Having all the sources present encourages maintaining the other sub-projects; when changing API.

Modifiability,"oking at a couple; of recent (Nov 2021) working days, we routinely see ~10 commits per; hour during peek times, with occasional spikes as high as ~15 commits; per hour. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we should plan for our builder to; complete ~10-15 builds an hour. Resource Appropriately; At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every; 4 to 6 minutes. For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs,; this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine. In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration. For some rough back of the envelope; numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will need something; on the order of 5-8 workers. If your build config takes ~2 hours, you'll; need something on the order of 20-30 workers. The rest of this section; focuses on how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots.

Instead, LiveDebugValues determines variable locations when control; flow merges. A dataflow analysis is used to propagate locations between blocks:; when control flow merges, if a variable has the same location in all; predecessors then that location is propagated into the successor. If the; predecessor locations disagree, the location becomes undefined. Once LiveDebugValues has run, every block should have all valid variable; locations described by DBG_VALUE instructions within the block. Very little; effort is then required by supporting classes (such as; DbgEntityHistoryCalculator) to build a map of each instruction to every; valid variable location, without the need to consider control flow. From; the example above, it is otherwise difficult to determine that the location; of variable ``!30`` should flow ""up"" into block ``%bb1``, but that the location; of variable ``!23`` should not flow ""down"" into the ``%exit`` block. .. _ccxx_frontend:.

Modifiability,"ollection classes inherit from **`TCollection`** and hence inherit; the **`TCollection::Write()` method. When you call; `TCollection`**`::Write()` each object in the container is written; individually into its own key in the file. To write all objects into one; key you can specify the name of the key and use the; option` TObject::kSingleKey`. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TList * list = new TList;; root[] TNamed * n1, * n2;; root[] n1 = new TNamed(""name1"",""title1"");; root[] n2 = new TNamed(""name2"",""title2"");; root[] list->Add(n1);; root[] list->Add(n2);; root[] gFile->WriteObject(list,""list"",TObject::kSingleKey);; ```. ### A TFile Object Going Out of Scope. There is another important point to remember about `TFile::Close` and; **`TFile::Write`**. When a variable is declared on the stack in a function; such as in the code below, it will be deleted when it goes out of; scope. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; }; ```. As soon as the function `foo `has finished executing, the variable `f`; is deleted. When a **`TFile`** object is deleted an implicit call to; `TFile::Close` is made. This will save only the file descriptor to disk.; It contains the file header, the `StreamerInfo `list, the key list, the; free segment list, and the end address. See ""The Physical Layout of ROOT; Files"". The `TFile::Close` does not make a call to `Write()`, which; means that the objects in memory will not be saved in the file. You need; to explicitly call `TFile::Write()` to save the object in memory to file; before the exit of the function. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; ... stuff ...; f.Write();; }; ```. To prevent an object in a function from being deleted when it goes out; of scope, you can create it on the heap instead of on the stack. This; will create a **`TFile`** object `f`, that is available on a global; scope, and it will still be available when exiting the function. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile *f = new TFile(""AFile.r",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:35310,variab,variable,35310,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"on about the Minuit2 fitter, please see the [documentation in ROOT][minuitdoc]. ## Source. There are two ways to get Minuit2; you can checkout the [ROOT] source, then just build or use `add_subdirectory` with `<ROOT_SOURCE>/math/minuit2`, or you can get a Minuit2 source distribution which contains all the needed files to build with [CMake]. See [DEVELOP.md] for more information about extracting the source files from [ROOT]. ## Building. To build, use the standard [CMake] procedure; on most systems, this looks like:. ```bash; mkdir PATH_TO_MINIUT2_BUILD; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_BUILD; cmake PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; cmake --build .; ```. Of course, GUIs, IDEs, etc. that work with [CMake] will work with this package. The standard method of CMake building, with a build directory inside the Minuit2 source directory and using the makefile generator, would look like:. ```bash; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; ```. The standard [CMake] variables, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, work with Minuit2. There are two other options:. * `minuit2_mpi` activates the (outdated C++) MPI bindings.; * `minuit2_omp` activates OpenMP (make sure all FCNs are threadsafe). ## Testing. You can run `ctest` or `make test` to run the Minuit2 test suite. ## Installing or using in another package. You can install the package using `cmake --build --target install .` (or `make install` if directly using the make system), or you can use it from the build directory. You can also include it in another CMake project using `add_subdirectory()` and linking to the `Minuit2` target. Since this package also exports targets, `find_package(Minuit2)` will also work once this package is built or installed. (For the curious, CMake adds a config script to `~/.cmake/packages` when building or; `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/cmake/Modules` when installing a package that has export commands.). To repeat; using this in your own CMake project usually amounts to:. ```cmake; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/README.md:1086,variab,variables,1086,math/minuit2/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/README.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

Function calls through TMethodCall etc have been accelerated. #### llvm / clang. llvm / clang were updated to r227800. This includes everything from the clang 3.6 release. ### Dictionary Generation. Detect usage of #pragma once for inlined headers. Turn on verbosity of genreflex if the VERBOSE environment variable is defined. Optimise forward declarations in rootmap files in order to make their interpretation faster. Propagate attributes specified in xml selection files to selected classes even when selected through typedefs. Optimise selection procedure caching selected declarations in the selection rules, therewith avoiding to query the AST twice. Include in the PCH all the STL and C headers to guarantee portability of binaries from SLC6 to CC7. ## I/O Libraries. ### I/O New functionalities. - Support for forward_list and I/O of unordered stl containers.; - Support for std::complex. ### I/O Behavior change. - The I/O now properly skip the content of base class onfile that have been removed from the in-memory class layout. - The scheduling the I/O customization rules within a StreamerInfo is now as soon as possible, i.e. after all sources have been read. One significant consequence is that now when an object is stored in a split branch; the rule is associtated with the branch of the last of the rule's sources rather; than the last of the object's data member. - Properly support TStreamerInfo written by ROOT v4.00. - Fix the ordering of the keys in a TFile being written; in particular fixing the result of GetKey and FindKey which were no longer returning the lastest cycle for a TFile being written since v5.34/11. ## Networking Libraries. ### HTTP Server. ##### Command Interface;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md:8399,portab,portability,8399,README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,1,['portab'],['portability']

LLVM allows an explicit code model to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals in the code model specified,; overriding the code model used to compile the translation unit.; The allowed values are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model. By default, global initializers are optimized by assuming that global; variables defined within the module are not modified from their; initial values before the start of the global initializer. This is; true even for variables potentially accessible from outside the; module, including those with external linkage or appearing in; ``@llvm.used`` or dllexported variables.

Users are responsible for managing the 8 integer labels (i.e., keeping; track of what labels they have used so far, picking one that is yet; unused, etc). Origin tracking trace representation; ------------------------------------. An origin tracking trace is a list of chains. Each chain has a stack trace; where the DFSan runtime records a label propagation, and a pointer to its; previous chain. The very first chain does not point to any chain. Every four 4-bytes aligned application bytes share a 4-byte origin trace ID. A; 4-byte origin trace ID contains a 4-bit depth and a 28-bit hash ID of a chain. A chain ID is calculated as a hash from a chain structure. A chain structure; contains a stack ID and the previous chain ID. The chain head has a zero; previous chain ID. A stack ID is a hash from a stack trace. The 4-bit depth; limits the maximal length of a path. The environment variable ``origin_history_size``; can set the depth limit. Non-positive values mean unlimited. Its default value; is 16. When reaching the limit, origin tracking ignores following propagation; chains. The first chain of a trace starts by `dfsan_set_label` with non-zero labels. A; new chain is appended at the end of a trace at stores or memory transfers when; ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 1. Memory transfers include LLVM memory transfer; instructions, glibc memcpy and memmove. When ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 2, a; new chain is also appended at loads. Other instructions do not create new chains, but simply propagate origin trace; IDs. If an instruction has more than one operands with non-zero labels, the origin; treace ID of the last operand with non-zero label is propagated to the result of; the instruction.

It is best to keep your Visual Studio IDE build folder separate from the; Ninja build folder. This prevents the two build systems from negatively; interacting with each other. Once the ``compile_commands.json`` file has been created by Ninja, you can; use that compilation database with Clang Tooling. One caveat is that because; there are indirect settings obtained through the environment variables,; you may need to run any Clang Tooling executables through a command prompt; window created for use with Visual Studio as described above. An; alternative, e.g. for using the Visual Studio debugger on a Clang Tooling; executable, is to ensure that the environment variables are also visible; to the debugger settings.

RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2. As with a Unix shell, the RUN lines permit pipelines and I/O; redirection to be used. There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value.

Modifiability,"on`` should be used where possible rather; than inspecting location operands directly to check or set whether a dbg.value; is a kill location. In general, if any dbg.value has its operand optimized out and cannot be; recovered, then a kill dbg.value is necessary to terminate earlier variable; locations. Additional kill dbg.values may be necessary when the debugger can; observe re-ordering of assignments. How variable location metadata is transformed during CodeGen; ============================================================. LLVM preserves debug information throughout mid-level and backend passes,; ultimately producing a mapping between source-level information and; instruction ranges. This; is relatively straightforwards for line number information, as mapping; instructions to line numbers is a simple association. For variable locations; however the story is more complex. As each ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic; represents a source-level assignment of a value to a source variable, the; variable location intrinsics effectively embed a small imperative program; within the LLVM IR. By the end of CodeGen, this becomes a mapping from each; variable to their machine locations over ranges of instructions.; From IR to object emission, the major transformations which affect variable; location fidelity are:. 1. Instruction Selection; 2. Register allocation; 3. Block layout. each of which are discussed below. In addition, instruction scheduling can; significantly change the ordering of the program, and occurs in a number of; different passes. Some variable locations are not transformed during CodeGen. Stack locations; specified by ``llvm.dbg.declare`` are valid and unchanging for the entire; duration of the function, and are recorded in a simple MachineFunction table.; Location changes in the prologue and epilogue of a function are also ignored:; frame setup and destruction may take several instructions, require a; disproportionate amount of debugging information in the output ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:24402,variab,variable,24402,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,2,['variab'],['variable']

A detailed User Guide for Minuit2 exists, describing the API of the internal classes.; ROOT uses `Minuit2` for fitting via the `Minuit2Minimizer` class which implements; the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface. `Minuit2` is also distributed as an independent package of ROOT and can be built; without any other dependency on the ROOT libraries. Examples on how to use the `Minuit2` and `Fumili2` plug-ins are provided; in the tutorials' directory `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/fit`:; `minuit2FitBench.C`, `minuit2FitBench2D.C` and `minuit2GausFit.C`.; More information on the classes and functions present in `Minuit2` is; available at; [online reference documentation](online reference documentation). Useful information on MINUIT and minimization in general is provided in the; following documents:. F. James, *Minuit Tutorial on Function Minimization* (; <http://seal.cern.ch/documents/minuit/mntutorial.pdf>); F. James, *The; Interpretation of Errors in Minuit* (; <http://seal.cern.ch/documents/minuit/mnerror.pdf>);. ## FUMILI Minimization Package. FUMILI is used to minimize Chi-square function or to search maximum of; likelihood function. Experimentally measured values $F_{i}$ are fitted; with theoretical; functions $f_{i}(\vec{x_{i}},\vec{\theta})$, where $\vec{x_{i}}$ are; coordinates, and $\vec{\theta}$ - vector of parameters.; For better convergence Chi-square function has to be the following form. $$; \frac{\",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:66006,plug-in,plug-ins,66006,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['plug-in'],['plug-ins']

Modifiability,"onding ROOT files, as part of the configure step.; At this point, you could continue to build (using `make`). Note that the CMake option `minuit2_inroot` will automatically be set to `ON` if you are inside the ROOT source tree. Setting `minuit2_standalone` requires that this be inside the ROOT source tree. As always, any manual setting of a cached variable in CMake will be remembered as long as the `CMakeCache.txt` file is not removed. Remember that after building a tarball or a binary package you should remove the copied files using:. ```bash; make purge; ```. Otherwise git shows the file as untracked, unless you explicitly remove their tracking yourself with a .gitignore file. ## Building a tarball. Minuit2 standalone also has support for CPack to make installers for different platforms. To build a source package:. ```bash; make package_source; ```. This will create a source file in several formats that you can distribute. Reminder: You **must** have used `-Dminuit2_standalone=ON` when you configured CMake, or many of the files will be missing. ## Building a binary. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make; make package; ```. ## Maintenance. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to [ROOT], they should be added to the source files lists in `src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Minuit2/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). For testing, the main `test/CMakeLists.txt` is used by ROOT, and the `test/*/CMakeLists.txt` files are used by the standalone build. ## How it works. Extracting from the ROOT sources is made possible through a few careful design features:. * A CMake variable `minuit2_inroot` lets the build system know we are inside ROOT (it looks for `../../build/version_info`); * All files that are not part of the minuit2 directory are passed into `copy_standalone`, and that handles selecting the correct location; * `copy_standalone` copies the files into the minuit2 source directory",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/DEVELOP.md:1443,config,configured,1443,math/minuit2/DEVELOP.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/DEVELOP.md,1,['config'],['configured']

It pushes a location description L with one memory location description SL; on the stack. SL is the target architecture specific memory location; description that corresponds to the thread-local storage address TA. The meaning of the thread-local storage address TA is defined by the; run-time environment. If the run-time environment supports multiple; thread-local storage blocks for a single thread, then the block; corresponding to the executable or shared library containing this DWARF; expression is used. *Some implementations of C, C++, Fortran, and other languages, support a; thread-local storage class. Variables with this storage class have distinct; values and addresses in distinct threads, much as automatic variables have; distinct values and addresses in each subprogram invocation. Typically,; there is a single block of storage containing all thread-local variables; declared in the main executable, and a separate block for the variables; declared in each shared library. Each thread-local variable can then be; accessed in its block using an identifier. This identifier is typically a; byte offset into the block and pushed onto the DWARF stack by one of the*; ``DW_OP_const*`` *operations prior to the* ``DW_OP_form_tls_address``; *operation.

When :program:`lit`; enters a sub-directory, it first checks to see if a nested test suite is; defined in that directory. If so, it loads that test suite recursively,; otherwise it instantiates a local test config for the directory (see; :ref:`local-configuration-files`). Tests are identified by the test suite they are contained within, and the; relative path inside that suite. Note that the relative path may not refer to; an actual file on disk; some test formats (such as *GoogleTest*) define; ""virtual tests"" which have a path that contains both the path to the actual; test file and a subpath to identify the virtual test. .. _local-configuration-",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:17191,variab,variable,17191,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

If you want to test relative line numbers like ``[[#@LINE+1]]``, specify; ``--leading-lines`` to add leading empty lines to preserve line numbers. If the extra files are large, the idiomatic place to put them is in a subdirectory ``Inputs``.; You can then refer to the extra files as ``%S/Inputs/foo.bar``.

Note; that one problem with 2.2 is that the shared library of the `Python`; interpreter core is not build by default and the '--enable-shared' flag; should thus be used when building `Python` from source. If the `Python`; interpreter that is installed on your system is too old, please obtain a; new version from <http://www.python.org>. Once configured, you continue the build process the normal way:. `$ make`. `$ make install`. After some time, a library called `libPyROOT.so` (or `libPyROOT.dll`, on; Windows) will be created in the; `$ROOTSYS/lib `(`$ROOTSYS/bin on Windows`) directory and a top Python; module, `ROOT.py`, will be copied into the same place. The final step is; to setup the shell environment, which is similar to what is described in; the chapter ‘Environment Settings'. Note that the `$ROOTSYS` entries are; probably already there if you followed the standard instructions, and; that the `PYTHONDIR` entries should be replaced as appropriate by your; choice at configuration time, or be left out if you had the; configuration script pick up them up from a default location. ### Using PyROOT. Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import.

As an example, the ``Block`` literal expression:. .. code-block:: c. ^ { printf(""hello world\n""); }. would cause the following to be created on a 32-bit system:. .. code-block:: c. struct __block_literal_1 {; void *isa;; int flags;; int reserved;; void (*invoke)(struct __block_literal_1 *);; struct __block_descriptor_1 *descriptor;; };. void __block_invoke_1(struct __block_literal_1 *_block) {; printf(""hello world\n"");; }. static struct __block_descriptor_1 {; unsigned long int reserved;; unsigned long int Block_size;; } __block_descriptor_1 = { 0, sizeof(struct __block_literal_1) };. and where the ``Block`` literal itself appears:. .. code-block:: c. struct __block_literal_1 _block_literal = {; &_NSConcreteStackBlock,; (1<<29), <uninitialized>,; __block_invoke_1,; &__block_descriptor_1; };. A ``Block`` imports other ``Block`` references, ``const`` copies of other; variables, and variables marked ``__block``. In Objective-C, variables may; additionally be objects. When a ``Block`` literal expression is used as the initial value of a global; or ``static`` local variable, it is initialized as follows:. .. code-block:: c. struct __block_literal_1 __block_literal_1 = {; &_NSConcreteGlobalBlock,; (1<<28)|(1<<29), <uninitialized>,; __block_invoke_1,; &__block_descriptor_1; };. that is, a different address is provided as the first value and a particular; (1<<28) bit is set in the ``flags`` field, and otherwise it is the same as for; stack based ``Block`` literals. This is an optimization that can be used for; any ``Block`` literal that imports no ``const`` or ``__block`` storage; variables. Imported Variables; ==================. Variables of ``auto`` storage class are imported as ``const`` copies. Variables; of ``__block`` storage class are imported as a pointer to an enclosing data; structure.

The current implementation of `RVec` is based on LLVM's SmallVector, extracted; from the head of LLVM's repo around December 2020.; We are not tracking the upstream implementation. Compared to LLVM's SmallVectors:. - memory adoption capabilities have been added; - patches have been applied to make RVec work with (ROOT's version of) cppyy (notably `using` declarations had to be; lowered in the inheritance hierarchy for cppyy to pick them up); - `operator[](mask)` has been added, as well as several other ""numpy-like"" helper; functions (these latter ones are free functions); - logical operators `==`, `<`, `>` etc. return vectors rather than booleans; - the type of fSize and fCapacity is signed rather than unsigned, and fixed to 32 bits; - a number of minor patches have been applied for backward compatibility with the previous; implementation of RVec (which did not have a small buffer optimization and was implemented; in terms of `std::vector` with a custom allocator) and to make the code more consistent; with ROOT's coding conventions. ## RVec design. `SmallVectorBase`; - `fBeginX`; - `fSize`; - `fCapacity`.

Clone the; `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics linked to the store, update the FragmentInfo in; the `ValueExpression`, and give the split stores (and cloned intrinsics) new; `DIAssignID` attachments each. In other words, treat the split stores as; separate assignments. For partial DSE (e.g. shortening a memset), we do the; same except that `llvm.dbg.assign` for the dead fragment gets an `Undef`; `Address`. **Promoting** allocas and store/loads: `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics implicitly; describe joined values in memory locations at CFG joins, but this is not; necessarily the case after promoting (or partially promoting) the; variable. Passes that promote variables are responsible for inserting; `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics after the resultant PHIs generated during; promotion. `mem2reg` already has to do this (with `llvm.dbg.value`) for; `llvm.dbg.declare`s. Where a store has no linked intrinsic, the store is; assumed to represent an assignment for variables stored at the destination; address. #### Debug intrinsic updates. **Moving** a debug intrinsic: avoid moving `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics where; possible, as they represent a source-level assignment, whose position in the; program should not be affected by optimization passes. **Deleting** a debug intrinsic: Nothing new to do.

Modifiability,"ooDataHist, representing binned data. A main problem with; this structure was that the implementation of the storage technology; (TTree) and the data representation (binned vs unbinned) were; intertwined. Starting with version 3.00, the class structure has been; rearranged: Now classes RooDataSet and RooDataHist inherit directly; from class RooAbsData, and class RooAbsData now owns an object that; inherits from RooAbsDataStore that implements the storage of the; data. This new class structure allows multiple data storage implementations to; be applied efficiently to both RooDataSet and RooDataHist; At present a single implementation of RooAbsDataStore exists,; class RooTreeDataStore, that contains the storage implementation; formerly implement in class RooTreeData. Methods in class RooTreeData; that were not specific to the storage technology have been moved to; class RooAbsData. If your user code only uses the classes RooDataSet,RooDataHist and RooAbsData; nothing will change: Existing RooDataSets and RooDataHists; (that inherit from RooTreeData) can be read in without problems in; RooFit 3.00 and will be converted on the fly to the new dataset structure; in memory. User code that explicitly uses RooTreeData pointers should; be changed to RooAbsData pointers. This change should be transparent; for all uses, with the exception of the RooTreeData::tree() method.; Explicit access to tree implementation can still be obtained; through the RooTreeDataStore::tree() method. (A pointer to the datastore; can be obtained through the RooAbsData::store() method.); Note that in future releases it is no longer guaranteed that all datasets are implemented; with a plain TTree implementation, so any user code that uses the tree; implementation directly should implement checks that the implementation; is indeed tree-based (data->store()->InheritsFrom(RooTreeDataStore::Class())==true)).

Modifiability,"ood introduction and there are various other introductions to it; available on your favorite search engine. The short version is that; ""execution"" of the Phi operation requires ""remembering"" which block; control came from. The Phi operation takes on the value corresponding to; the input control block. In this case, if control comes in from the; ""then"" block, it gets the value of ""calltmp"". If control comes from the; ""else"" block, it gets the value of ""calltmp1"". At this point, you are probably starting to think ""Oh no! This means my; simple and elegant front-end will have to start generating SSA form in; order to use LLVM!"". Fortunately, this is not the case, and we strongly; advise *not* implementing an SSA construction algorithm in your; front-end unless there is an amazingly good reason to do so. In; practice, there are two sorts of values that float around in code; written for your average imperative programming language that might need; Phi nodes:. #. Code that involves user variables: ``x = 1; x = x + 1;``; #. Values that are implicit in the structure of your AST, such as the; Phi node in this case. In `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of this tutorial (""mutable variables""),; we'll talk about #1 in depth. For now, just believe me that you don't; need SSA construction to handle this case. For #2, you have the choice; of using the techniques that we will describe for #1, or you can insert; Phi nodes directly, if convenient. In this case, it is really; easy to generate the Phi node, so we choose to do it directly. Okay, enough of the motivation and overview, let's generate code!.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accept",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:162410,variab,variable,162410,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

For example if I am generating register information I would look for all defs that are instances of `RegisterInfo` in the example below. ```tablegen; class RegisterInfo {}; def X0: RegisterInfo {}; def X1: RegisterInfo {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class RegisterInfo {; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X0 {	// RegisterInfo; }; def X1 {	// RegisterInfo; }. ## Inheritance. Like many other languages with classes, a class in TableGen can inherit properties of another class. ```tablegen; class C {}; class D : C {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; }; class D {	// C; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Inheritance is done by putting the class you want to inherit from after `:`, before the opening `{`. You'll know that `D` inherits from `C` by the `// C` comment on the `class D {` line in the output. Not very interesting though, what are we actually inheriting? The members of the parent class. ```tablegen; class C {; int a;; }; class D : C {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = ?;; }; class D {	// C; int a = ?;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Note that `D` now has the `a` member which was defined in the class `C`. You can inherit from multiple classes. In that case the order that that happens in matches the order you write the class names after the `:`. ```tablegen; class C {; int a = 1;; }; class D {; int a = 2;; }; class E : C, D {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = 1;; }; class D {; int a = 2;; }; class E {	// C D; int a = 2;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Class `E` first inherits from class `C`. This gives `E` a member `a` with value `1`. Then it inherits from class `D` which also has a member `a` but with a value of `2`. Meaning the final value of `E`'s `a` is `2`.

While this is; not necessary for classification, it is necessary for; regression. The inverse transformation of the normalization; transformation has been implemented. Started to extend the variable transformations to the; regression targets as well. MethodCuts now produces the 'optimal-cut' histograms needed; by macro mvaeffs.C.

In this case we'll create the AST node for ""a+b"", and; then continue parsing:. .. code-block:: c++. ... if body omitted ...; }. // Merge LHS/RHS.; LHS = std::make_unique<BinaryExprAST>(BinOp, std::move(LHS),; std::move(RHS));; } // loop around to the top of the while loop.; }. In our example above, this will turn ""a+b+"" into ""(a+b)"" and execute the; next iteration of the loop, with ""+"" as the current token. The code; above will eat, remember, and parse ""(c+d)"" as the primary expression,; which makes the current pair equal to [+, (c+d)]. It will then evaluate; the 'if' conditional above with ""\*"" as the binop to the right of the; primary. In this case, the precedence of ""\*"" is higher than the; precedence of ""+"" so the if condition will be entered. The critical question left here is ""how can the if condition parse the; right hand side in full""? In particular, to build the AST correctly for; our example, it needs to get all of ""(c+d)\*e\*f"" as the RHS expression; variable. The code to do this is surprisingly simple (code from the; above two blocks duplicated for context):. .. code-block:: c++. // If BinOp binds less tightly with RHS than the operator after RHS, let; // the pending operator take RHS as its LHS.; int NextPrec = GetTokPrecedence();; if (TokPrec < NextPrec) {; RHS = ParseBinOpRHS(TokPrec+1, std::move(RHS));; if (!RHS); return nullptr;; }; // Merge LHS/RHS.; LHS = std::make_unique<BinaryExprAST>(BinOp, std::move(LHS),; std::move(RHS));; } // loop around to the top of the while loop.; }. At this point, we know that the binary operator to the RHS of our; primary has higher precedence than the binop we are currently parsing.; As such, we know that any sequence of pairs whose operators are all; higher precedence than ""+"" should be parsed together and returned as; ""RHS"". To do this, we recursively invoke the ``ParseBinOpRHS`` function",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:18853,variab,variable,18853,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate. If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.01; }. The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases. The mem2reg optimization; pass is the answer to dealing with mutable variables, and we highly; recommend that you depend on it. Note that mem2reg only works on; variables in certain circumstances:. #. mem2reg is alloca-driven: it looks for allocas and if it can handle; them, it promotes them. It does not apply to global variables or heap; allocations.; #. mem2reg only looks for alloca instructions in the entry block of the; function. Being in the entry block guarantees that the alloca is only; executed once, which makes analysis simpler.; #. mem2reg only promotes allocas whose uses are direct loads and stores.; If the address of the stack object is passed to a function, or if any; funny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers.

Before the optimization:. .. code-block:: llvm. define double @fib(double %x) {; entry:; %x1 = alloca double; store double %x, double* %x1; %x2 = load double, double* %x1; %cmptmp = fcmp ult double %x2, 3.000000e+00; %booltmp = uitofp i1 %cmptmp to double; %ifcond = fcmp one double %booltmp, 0.000000e+00; br i1 %ifcond, label %then, label %else. then: ; preds = %entry; br label %ifcont. else: ; preds = %entry; %x3 = load double, double* %x1; %subtmp = fsub double %x3, 1.000000e+00; %calltmp = call double @fib(double %subtmp); %x4 = load double, double* %x1; %subtmp5 = fsub double %x4, 2.000000e+00; %calltmp6 = call double @fib(double %subtmp5); %addtmp = fadd double %calltmp, %calltmp6; br label %ifcont. ifcont: ; preds = %else, %then; %iftmp = phi double [ 1.000000e+00, %then ], [ %addtmp, %else ]; ret double %iftmp; }. Here there is only one variable (x, the input argument) but you can; still see the extremely simple-minded code generation strategy we are; using. In the entry block, an alloca is created, and the initial input; value is stored into it. Each reference to the variable does a reload; from the stack. Also, note that we didn't modify the if/then/else; expression, so it still inserts a PHI node. While we could make an; alloca for it, it is actually easier to create a PHI node for it, so we; still just make the PHI.

TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.). A TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence is an ordered sequence of configured actions. A configured action has both an action which is a free standing function and a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TConfiguration. The configuration contains information that is specific to the action; but varies from use to use, including the offset from the beginning of the object that needs to be updated.; Other examples of configuration include the number of bits requested for storing a Double32_t or its factor and minimum. When the sequence is intended for a collection, the sequence has a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TLoopConfiguration which contains for example the size of the element of; a vector or the pointers to the iterators functions (see below).

Modifiability,"optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant. If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module. A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific; numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces; may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target; instructions are used to access the variable.

This can be a big win in; cases where the malloc/free call is far more expensive than the code that; fiddles around with the elements. This is good for vectors that are ""usually small"" (e.g. the number of; predecessors/successors of a block is usually less than 8). On the other hand,; this makes the size of the SmallVector itself large, so you don't want to; allocate lots of them (doing so will waste a lot of space). As such,; SmallVectors are most useful when on the stack. In the absence of a well-motivated choice for the number of; inlined elements ``N``, it is recommended to use ``SmallVector<T>`` (that is,; omitting the ``N``). This will choose a default number of; inlined elements reasonable for allocation on the stack (for example, trying; to keep ``sizeof(SmallVector<T>)`` around 64 bytes). SmallVector also provides a nice portable and efficient replacement for; ``alloca``.

General Principles; ------------------. The RNTuple classes provide the functionality to read, write, and describe RNTuple datasets.; The core classes, such as `RNTupleReader` and `RNTupleWriter`, are part of the RNTuple library.; Additional tools, such as the `RNTupleImporter` and the `RNTupleInspector`, are part of the RNTupleUtils library,; which depends on the RNTuple library.

In addition, a **`TVector2`** is a basic; implementation of a vector in two dimensions and is not part of the; CLHEP translation. ## TVector3. ![](pictures/030001A9.png). **`TVector3`** is a general three-vector; class, which can be used for description of different vectors in 3D.; Components of three vectors:. - $x$, $y$, $z$ = basic components. - $\theta$ = azimuth angle. - $\phi$ = polar angle. - magnitude = $mag$ = $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. - transverse component = $perp$ = $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Using the **`TVector3`** class, you should remember that it contains; only common features of three vectors and lacks methods specific for; some particular vector values. For example, it has no translated; function because translation has no meaning for vectors. ### Declaration / Access to the Components. **`TVector3`** has been implemented as a vector of three `Double_t`; variables, representing the Cartesian coordinates. By default the values; are initialized to zero, however you can change them in the constructor:. ``` {.cpp}; TVector3 v1; // v1 = (0,0,0); TVector3 v2(1); // v2 = (1,0,0); TVector3 v3(1,2,3); // v3 = (1,2,3); TVector3 v4(v2); // v4 = v2; ```. It is also possible (but not recommended) to initialize a **`TVector3`**; with a `Double_t` or `Float_t C` array. You can get the components by; name or by index:. ``` {.cpp}; xx = v1.X(); or xx = v1(0);; yy = v1.Y(); yy = v1(1);; zz = v1.Z(); zz = v1(2);; ```. The methods `SetX()`, `SetY()`, `SetZ()` and `SetXYZ()` allow you to set; the components:. ``` {.cpp}; v1.SetX(1.); v1.SetY(2.); v1.SetZ(3.);; v1.SetXYZ(1.,2.,3.);; ```. ### Other Coordinates. To get information on the **`TVector3`** in spherical (`rho`, `phi`,; `theta`) or cylindrical (`z`, `r`, `theta`) coordinates, the following; methods can be used. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t m = v.Mag();; // get magnitude (=rho=Sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)));",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PhysicsVectors.md:2193,variab,variables,2193,documentation/users-guide/PhysicsVectors.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PhysicsVectors.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags.

If specified, it is parsed in a special mode; where undefined (unrecognized) identifiers are interpreted as literal; strings. In particular, global identifiers are considered unrecognized.; These include global variables defined by ``defvar`` and ``defset``. A; record name can be the null string. If no name value is given, the record is *anonymous*. The final name of an; anonymous record is unspecified but globally unique. Special handling occurs if a ``def`` appears inside a ``multiclass``; statement. See the ``multiclass`` section below for details. A record can inherit from one or more classes by specifying the; :token:`ParentClassList` clause at the beginning of its record body. All of; the fields in the parent classes are added to the record. If two or more; parent classes provide the same field, the record ends up with the field value; of the last parent class.

Were we to move; the DBG_VALUE of virtual register %7 upwards with the SUB32rr, we would re-order; assignments and introduce a new state of the program. Whereas with the solution; above, the debugger will see one fewer combination of variable values, because; ``!3`` and ``!5`` will change value at the same time. This is preferred over; misrepresenting the original program. In comparison, if one sunk the MOV32rm, LLVM would produce the following:. .. code-block:: text. DBG_VALUE $noreg, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2. Here, to avoid presenting a state in which the first assignment to ``!1``; disappears, the DBG_VALUE at the top of the block assigns the variable the; undefined location, until its value is available at the end of the block where; an additional DBG_VALUE is added. Were any other DBG_VALUE for ``!1`` to occur; in the instructions that the MOV32rm was sunk past, the DBG_VALUE for ``%1``; would be dropped and the debugger would never observe it in the variable. This; accurately reflects that the value is not available during the corresponding; portion of the original program.

To avoid debug instructions interfering with the register allocator, the; LiveDebugVariables pass extracts variable locations from a MIR function and; deletes the corresponding DBG_VALUE instructions.

Modifiability,"orial runs through the implementation of a JIT compiler using LLVM's; On-Request-Compilation (ORC) APIs. It begins with a simplified version of the; KaleidoscopeJIT class used in the; `Implementing a language with LLVM <LangImpl01.html>`_ tutorials and then; introduces new features like concurrent compilation, optimization, lazy; compilation and remote execution. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to LLVM's ORC JIT APIs, show how; these APIs interact with other parts of LLVM, and to teach you how to recombine; them to build a custom JIT that is suited to your use-case. The structure of the tutorial is:. - Chapter #1: Investigate the simple KaleidoscopeJIT class. This will; introduce some of the basic concepts of the ORC JIT APIs, including the; idea of an ORC *Layer*. - `Chapter #2 <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_: Extend the basic KaleidoscopeJIT by adding; a new layer that will optimize IR and generated code. - `Chapter #3 <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_: Further extend the JIT by adding a; Compile-On-Demand layer to lazily compile IR. - `Chapter #4 <BuildingAJIT4.html>`_: Improve the laziness of our JIT by; replacing the Compile-On-Demand layer with a custom layer that uses the ORC; Compile Callbacks API directly to defer IR-generation until functions are; called. - `Chapter #5 <BuildingAJIT5.html>`_: Add process isolation by JITing code into; a remote process with reduced privileges using the JIT Remote APIs. To provide input for our JIT we will use a lightly modified version of the; Kaleidoscope REPL from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a; language in LLVM tutorial"". Finally, a word on API generations: ORC is the 3rd generation of LLVM JIT API.; It was preceded by MCJIT, and before that by the (now deleted) legacy JIT.; These tutorials don't assume any experience with these earlier APIs, but; readers acquainted with them will see many familiar elements.

As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake. The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:.

Note that the ""sroa"" pass is; more powerful and can promote structs, ""unions"", and arrays in many; cases. All of these properties are easy to satisfy for most imperative; languages, and we'll illustrate it below with Kaleidoscope. The final; question you may be asking is: should I bother with this nonsense for my; front-end? Wouldn't it be better if I just did SSA construction; directly, avoiding use of the mem2reg optimization pass? In short, we; strongly recommend that you use this technique for building SSA form,; unless there is an extremely good reason not to. Using this technique; is:. - Proven and well tested: clang uses this technique; for local mutable variables. As such, the most common clients of LLVM; are using this to handle a bulk of their variables. You can be sure; that bugs are found fast and fixed early.; - Extremely Fast: mem2reg has a number of special cases that make it; fast in common cases as well as fully general. For example, it has; fast-paths for variables that are only used in a single block,; variables that only have one assignment point, good heuristics to; avoid insertion of unneeded phi nodes, etc.; - Needed for debug info generation: `Debug information in; LLVM <../../SourceLevelDebugging.html>`_ relies on having the address of; the variable exposed so that debug info can be attached to it. This; technique dovetails very naturally with this style of debug info. If nothing else, this makes it much easier to get your front-end up and; running, and is very simple to implement.

This design goal aims to keep the ``lib/Support`` interface small and; understandable which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems supported for a given class of operating system (e.g. Unix, Win32). No Virtual Methods; ------------------. The Support Library interfaces can be called quite frequently by LLVM. In order; to make those calls as efficient as possible, we discourage the use of virtual; methods. There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------. Any functions defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``); must not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header; file for that function is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------.

This specifies a user identified environment variable which is treated as; a path delimiter (`;`) separated list of paths to map into `-imsvc`; arguments which are treated as `-isystem`. - `INCLUDE` and `EXTERNAL_INCLUDE`. The path delimiter (`;`) separated list of paths will be mapped to; `-imsvc` arguments which are treated as `-isystem`. - `LIB` (indirectly). The linker `link.exe` or `lld-link.exe` will honour the environment; variable `LIB` which is a path delimiter (`;`) set of paths to consult for; the import libraries to use when linking the final target. The following environment variables will be consulted and used to form paths; to validate and load content from as appropriate:. - `VCToolsInstallDir`; - `VCINSTALLDIR`; - `Path`. 3.

For example to delete a directory from a file, you must specify the; directory cycle:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] f->Delete(""Wed011003;1""); ```. Some other examples of `namecycle` format are:. - `foo`:delete the object named `foo` from memory. - `foo;1`: delete the cycle 1 of the object named `foo` from the file. - `foo;*`: delete all cycles of `foo` from the file and also from; memory. - `*;2`: delete all objects with cycle number 2 from the file. - `*;*: delete` all objects from memory and from the file. - `T*;*`: delete all objects from memory and from the file including; all subdirectories. ## Streamers. To follow the discussion on `Streamers`, you need to know what a; *simple* data type is. A variable is of a simple data type if it cannot; be decomposed into other types. Examples of simple data types are longs,; shorts, floats, and chars. In contrast, a variable is of a *composite*; data type if it can be decomposed. For example, classes, structures, and; arrays are composite types. Simple types are also called primitive; types, basic types, and Cling sometimes calls them fundamental types. When we say, ""writing an object to a file"", we actually mean writing the; current values of the data members. The most common way to do this is to; decompose (also called the serialization of) the object into its data; members and write them to disk. The decomposition is the job of the; `Streamer`. Every class with ambitions to be stored in a file has a; `Streamer `that decomposes it and ""streams"" its members into a buffer. The methods of the class are not written to the file, it contains only; the persistent data members. To decompose the parent classes, the; `Streamer `calls the `Streamer `of the parent classes. It moves up the; inheritance tree until it reaches an ancestor without a parent. To; serialize the object data members it calls their `Streamer`.

Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory.

JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:30884,sandbox,sandboxed,30884,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['sandbox'],['sandboxed']

After all optimizations have run and shortly before emission, the; LiveDebugValues pass runs to achieve two aims:. * To propagate the location of variables through copies and register spills,; * For every block, to record every valid variable location in that block. After this pass the DBG_VALUE instruction changes meaning: rather than; corresponding to a source-level assignment where the variable may change value,; it asserts the location of a variable in a block, and loses effect outside the; block. Propagating variable locations through copies and spills is; straightforwards: determining the variable location in every basic block; requires the consideration of control flow.

Modifiability,"ot enabled, this qualifier causes these; variables to be kept without retain messages being sent. This; knowingly leads to dangling pointers if the Block (or a copy) outlives; the lifetime of this object. In garbage collected environments, the ``__weak`` variable is set to; nil when the object it references is collected, as long as the; ``__block`` variable resides in the heap (either by default or via; ``Block_copy()``). The initial Apple implementation does in fact; start ``__block`` variables on the stack and migrate them to the heap; only as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. It is a runtime error to attempt to assign a reference to a; stack-based Block into any storage marked ``__weak``, including; ``__weak`` ``__block`` variables. C++ Extensions; ==============. Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in automatic storage. As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression.

For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others. C99 obviously does not specify the semantics of any of these; extensions, and the definition of i-c-e does not include them. However, these; extensions are often used in real code, and we have to have a way to reason; about them. Finally, this is not just a problem for semantic analysis. The code generator; and other clients have to be able to fold constants (e.g., to initialize global; variables) and have to handle a superset of what C99 allows. Further, these; clients can benefit from extended information. For example, we know that; ""``foo() || 1``"" always evaluates to ``true``, but we can't replace the; expression with ``true`` because it has side effects.

The style of the histogram is; inherited from the **`TTree`** attributes and the current style; (***`gStyle`***) is ignored. The **`TTree`** gets its attributes from; the current **`TStyle`** at the time it was created.

To recap, unfortunately, ROOT PCH is not extendable; ROOTMAP requires a lot of; maintenance and goes on a very untested codepath, while RDICT has a very limited; scope. The three features require a lot of mechanisms to work together and the; corner cases are very many. The interaction between some of the features often; break design and introduce layering violations. ## From C++ Modules to Dictionaries. C++ Modules have native capabilities to avoid reparsing. It combines all; home-grown solutions to avoid the costly operation at industry quality. Currently, when ROOT is built with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` it gives priority to; C++ Module files (real *pcm* files). If such a file is present it reads all; necessary information from it.

Modifiability,"other types. Examples of simple data types are longs,; shorts, floats, and chars. In contrast, a variable is of a *composite*; data type if it can be decomposed. For example, classes, structures, and; arrays are composite types. Simple types are also called primitive; types, basic types, and Cling sometimes calls them fundamental types. When we say, ""writing an object to a file"", we actually mean writing the; current values of the data members. The most common way to do this is to; decompose (also called the serialization of) the object into its data; members and write them to disk. The decomposition is the job of the; `Streamer`. Every class with ambitions to be stored in a file has a; `Streamer `that decomposes it and ""streams"" its members into a buffer. The methods of the class are not written to the file, it contains only; the persistent data members. To decompose the parent classes, the; `Streamer `calls the `Streamer `of the parent classes. It moves up the; inheritance tree until it reaches an ancestor without a parent. To; serialize the object data members it calls their `Streamer`. They in; turn move up their own inheritance tree and so forth. The simple data; members are written to the buffer directly. Eventually the buffer; contains all simple data members of all the classes that make up this; particular object. Data members that are references (as; `MyClass &fObj;`) are never saved, it is always the responsibility of; the object's constructor to set them properly. ### Automatically Generated Streamers. A `Streamer `usually calls other `Streamers`: the `Streamer `of its; parents and data members. This architecture depends on all classes; having `Streamers`, because eventually they will be called. To ensure; that a class has a `Streamer`, `rootcling` automatically creates one in; the `ClassDef` macro that is defined in `$ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h`.; `ClassDef` defines several methods for any class, and one of them is the; `Streamer`.

The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True.

These are the coding conventions:. - Classes begin with **`T`**: **`TLine`**, **`TTree`**. - Non-class types end with **`_t`**: `Int_t`. - Data members begin with **`f`**: `fTree`. - Member functions begin with a capital: `Loop()`. - Constants begin with **`k`**: `kInitialSize`, `kRed `. - Global variables begin with **`g`**: ***`gEnv`***. - Static data members begin with **`fg`**: `fgTokenClient `. - Enumeration types begin with **`E`**: `EColorLevel`. - Locals and parameters begin with a lower case: `nbytes`. - Getters and setters begin with **`Get`** and **`Set`**:; `SetLast`(), `GetFirst`(). ### Machine Independent Types. Different machines may have different lengths for the same type. The; most famous example is the `int` type. It may be 16 bits on some old; machines and 32 bits on some newer ones. To ensure the size of your; variables, use these pre defined types in ROOT:. - **`Char_t`** Signed Character 1 byte. - **`UChar_t`** Unsigned Character 1 byte. - **`Short_t`** Signed Short integer 2 bytes. - **`UShort_t`** Unsigned Short integer 2 bytes. - **`Int_t`** Signed integer 4 bytes. - **`UInt_t `**Unsigned integer 4 bytes. - **`Long64_t`** Portable signed long integer 8 bytes. - **`ULong64_t`** Portable unsigned long integer 8 bytes. - **`Float_t`** Float 4 bytes. - **`Double_t`** Float 8 bytes. - **`Double32_t`** Double 8 bytes in memory, written as a Float 4; bytes. - **`Bool_t`** Boolean (0=false, 1=true). If you do not want to save a variable on disk, you can use `int` or; `Int_t`, the result will be the same and the interpreter or the; compiler will treat them in exactly the same way. ### TObject.

As a result,; the surrounding ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives cannot be reordered, i.e. all; occurrences matching ``CHECK-DAG:`` before ``CHECK-NOT:`` must not fall behind; occurrences matching ``CHECK-DAG:`` after ``CHECK-NOT:``. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK-DAG: BEFORE; ; CHECK-NOT: NOT; ; CHECK-DAG: AFTER. This case will reject input strings where ``BEFORE`` occurs after ``AFTER``. With captured variables, ``CHECK-DAG:`` is able to match valid topological; orderings of a DAG with edges from the definition of a variable to its use.; It's useful, e.g., when your test cases need to match different output; sequences from the instruction scheduler. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK-DAG: add [[REG1:r[0-9]+]], r1, r2; ; CHECK-DAG: add [[REG2:r[0-9]+]], r3, r4; ; CHECK: mul r5, [[REG1]], [[REG2]]. In this case, any order of that two ``add`` instructions will be allowed. If you are defining `and` using variables in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block,; be aware that the definition rule can match `after` its use. So, for instance, the code below will pass:. .. code-block:: text. ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2:d[0-9]+]][0]; ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2]][1]; vmov.32 d0[1]; vmov.32 d0[0].

If the definition your test is looking for doesn't match (because; of a bug in the compiler), it may match further away from the use, and mask; real bugs away.

Where control flow merges in ``%bb1`` we would; want ``!30`` to keep its location (``%input``), but ``!23`` to become undefined; as we cannot determine at runtime what value it should have in %bb1 without; inserting a PHI node. mem2reg does not insert the PHI node to avoid changing; codegen when debugging is enabled, and does not insert the other dbg.values; to avoid adding very large numbers of intrinsics. Instead, LiveDebugValues determines variable locations when control; flow merges. A dataflow analysis is used to propagate locations between blocks:; when control flow merges, if a variable has the same location in all; predecessors then that location is propagated into the successor. If the; predecessor locations disagree, the location becomes undefined. Once LiveDebugValues has run, every block should have all valid variable; locations described by DBG_VALUE instructions within the block. Very little; effort is then required by supporting classes (such as; DbgEntityHistoryCalculator) to build a map of each instruction to every; valid variable location, without the need to consider control flow. From; the example above, it is otherwise difficult to determine that the location; of variable ``!30`` should flow ""up"" into block ``%bb1``, but that the location; of variable ``!23`` should not flow ""down"" into the ``%exit`` block. .. _ccxx_frontend:.

To analyze the function body we can use a lattice which consists of normal; states and failure states. A normal state describes program points where we are; sure that no behaviors that block the refactoring have occurred. Normal states; keep track of all parameter's member fields that are known to be overwritten on; every path from function entry to the corresponding program point. Failure; states accumulate observed violations (unsafe reads and pointer escapes) that; block the refactoring. In the partial order of the lattice failure states compare greater than normal; states, which guarantees that they ""win"" when joined with normal states. Order; between failure states is determined by inclusion relation on the set of; accumulated violations (lattice's `⩽` is `⊆` on the set of violations).

A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram; editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets; for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A; geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials; and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in; collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional; data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees. ### General Characteristics. The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to; `TObjects`, so:. - They can only hold objects that inherit from **`TObject`**. - They return pointers to `TObjects`, that have to be cast back to the; correct subclass. Collections are dynamic; they can grow in size as required. Collections; themselves are descendants of **`TObject`** so can themselves be held in; collections. It is possible to nest one type of collection inside; another to any level to produce structures of arbitrary complexity. Collections do not own the objects they hold for the very good reason; that the same object could be a member of more than one collection.; Object ownership is important when it comes to deleting objects; if; nobody owns the object it could end up as wasted memory (i.e. a memory; leak) when no longer needed. If a collection is deleted, its objects are; not. The user can force a collection to delete its objects, but that is; the user's choice. ### Determining the Class of Contained Objects.

The :doc:`LibTooling`; library provides several other APIs that are used when developing a; refactoring action.

You can combine; :doc:`AST matchers<LibASTMatchers>` and the refactoring engine to implement; refactorings that don't lend themselves well to source selection and/or have to; query ASTs for some particular nodes. We assume basic knowledge about the Clang AST. See the :doc:`Introduction; to the Clang AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>` if you want to learn more; about how the AST is structured. .. FIXME: create new refactoring action tutorial and link to the tutorial. Introduction; ------------. Clang's refactoring engine defines a set refactoring actions that implement; a number of different source transformations. The ``clang-refactor``; command-line tool can be used to perform these refactorings. Certain; refactorings are also available in other clients like text editors and IDEs. A refactoring action is a class that defines a list of related refactoring; operations (rules). These rules are grouped under a common umbrella - a single; ``clang-refactor`` command. In addition to rules, the refactoring action; provides the action's command name and description to ``clang-refactor``.; Each action must implement the ``RefactoringAction`` interface.

Step 3.5: More Complicated Matchers; ===================================. Our simple matcher is capable of discovering for loops, but we would; still need to filter out many more ourselves. We can do a good portion; of the remaining work with some cleverly chosen matchers, but first we; need to decide exactly which properties we want to allow. How can we characterize for loops over arrays which would be eligible; for translation to range-based syntax? Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable. The matcher for (2) is straightforward:; require a pre- or post-increment of the same variable declared in the; init portion. Unfortunately, such a matcher is impossible to write. Matchers contain; no logic for comparing two arbitrary AST nodes and determining whether; or not they are equal, so the best we can do is matching more than we; would like to allow, and punting extra comparisons to the callback. In any case, we can start building this sub-matcher. We can require that; the increment step be a unary increment like this:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""++""))). Specifying what is incremented introduces another quirk of Clang's AST:; Usages of variables are represented as ``DeclRefExpr``'s (""declaration; reference expressions"") because they are expressions which refer to; variable declarations.

Interaction and relationship between ``User`` and ``Use`` objects; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A subclass of ``User`` can choose between incorporating its ``Use`` objects or; refer to them out-of-line by means of a pointer. A mixed variant (some ``Use``; s inline others hung off) is impractical and breaks the invariant that the; ``Use`` objects belonging to the same ``User`` form a contiguous array. We have 2 different layouts in the ``User`` (sub)classes:. * Layout a). The ``Use`` object(s) are inside (resp. at fixed offset) of the ``User``; object and there are a fixed number of them. * Layout b). The ``Use`` object(s) are referenced by a pointer to an array from the; ``User`` object and there may be a variable number of them. As of v2.4 each layout still possesses a direct pointer to the start of the; array of ``Use``\ s. Though not mandatory for layout a), we stick to this; redundancy for the sake of simplicity. The ``User`` object also stores the; number of ``Use`` objects it has. (Theoretically this information can also be; calculated given the scheme presented below.). Special forms of allocation operators (``operator new``) enforce the following; memory layouts:. * Layout a) is modelled by prepending the ``User`` object by the ``Use[]``; array. .. code-block:: none. ...---.---.---.---.-------...; | P | P | P | P | User; '''---'---'---'---'-------'''. * Layout b) is modelled by pointing at the ``Use[]`` array. .. code-block:: none. .-------...; | User; '-------'''; |; v; .---.---.---.---...; | P | P | P | P |; '---'---'---'---'''. *(In the above figures* '``P``' *stands for the* ``Use**`` *that is stored in; each* ``Use`` *object in the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:127872,variab,variable,127872,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

The ``DeclarationName`` class represents the name of a declaration in Clang.; Declarations in the C family of languages can take several different forms.; Most declarations are named by simple identifiers, e.g., ""``f``"" and ""``x``"" in; the function declaration ``f(int x)``. In C++, declaration names can also name; class constructors (""``Class``"" in ``struct Class { Class(); }``), class; destructors (""``~Class``""), overloaded operator names (""``operator+``""), and; conversion functions (""``operator void const *``""). In Objective-C,; declaration names can refer to the names of Objective-C methods, which involve; the method name and the parameters, collectively called a *selector*, e.g.,; ""``setWidth:height:``"". Since all of these kinds of entities --- variables,; functions, Objective-C methods, C++ constructors, destructors, and operators; --- are represented as subclasses of Clang's common ``NamedDecl`` class,; ``DeclarationName`` is designed to efficiently represent any kind of name. Given a ``DeclarationName`` ``N``, ``N.getNameKind()`` will produce a value; that describes what kind of name ``N`` stores. There are 10 options (all of; the names are inside the ``DeclarationName`` class). ``Identifier``. The name is a simple identifier. Use ``N.getAsIdentifierInfo()`` to retrieve; the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo*`` pointing to the actual identifier. ``ObjCZeroArgSelector``, ``ObjCOneArgSelector``, ``ObjCMultiArgSelector``. The name is an Objective-C selector, which can be retrieved as a ``Selector``; instance via ``N.getObjCSelector()``. The three possible name kinds for; Objective-C reflect an optimization within the ``DeclarationName`` class:; both zero- and one-argument selectors are stored as a masked; ``IdentifierInfo`` pointer, and therefore require very little space, since; zero- and one-argument selectors are far more",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:68916,variab,variables,68916,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

A property is ill-formed if it has conflicting; sources of ownership, or if it has redundant ownership modifiers, or if it has; ``__autoreleasing`` ownership. * ``assign`` implies ``__unsafe_unretained`` ownership.; * ``copy`` implies ``__strong`` ownership, as well as the usual behavior of; copy semantics on the setter.; * ``retain`` implies ``__strong`` ownership.; * ``strong`` implies ``__strong`` ownership.; * ``unsafe_unretained`` implies ``__unsafe_unretained`` ownership.; * ``weak`` implies ``__weak`` ownership. With the exception of ``weak``, these modifiers are available in non-ARC; modes. A property's specified ownership is preserved in its metadata, but otherwise; the meaning is purely conventional unless the property is synthesized. If a; property is synthesized, then the :arc-term:`associated instance variable` is; the instance variable which is named, possibly implicitly, by the; ``@synthesize`` declaration. If the associated instance variable already; exists, then its ownership qualification must equal the ownership of the; property; otherwise, the instance variable is created with that ownership; qualification.

The kind of mangling will depend on the DataLayout, which in turn; depends on the target platform. To allow us to remain portable and search based; on the un-mangled name, we just re-produce this mangling ourselves using our; ``Mangle`` member function object.

While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them.

In; general, the expression is:. ``` {.cpp}; Selection = ""weight *(boolean expression)""; ```. If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the histogram is filled; with a weight. If the weight is not explicitly specified it is assumed; to be 1. For example, this selection will add 1 to the histogram if x is less; than y and the square root of z is less than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; ```. On the other hand, this selection will add `x+y` to the histogram if the; square root of z is larger than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; ```. The `Draw` method has its own parser, and it only looks in the current; tree for variables. This means that any variable used in the selection; must be defined in the tree. You cannot use an arbitrary global variable; in the `TTree::Draw` method. ### Using TCut Objects in TTree::Draw. The `TTree::Draw` method also accepts **`TCutG`** objects. A; **`TCut`** is a specialized string object used for **`TTree`**; selections. A **`TCut`** object has a name and a title. It does not have; any data members in addition to what it inherits from **`TNamed`**. It; only adds a set of operators to do logical string concatenation. For; example, assume:. ``` {.cpp}; TCut cut1 = ""x<1""; TCut cut2 = ""y>2""; ```. then. ``` {.cpp}; cut1 && cut2; //result is the string ""(x<1)&&(y>2)""; ```. Operators =, +=, +, \*, !, &&, || are overloaded, here are some; examples:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCut c1 = ""x < 1""; root[] TCut c2 = ""y < 0""; root[] TCut c3 = c1 && c2; root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 || ""x>0""); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 && c2); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", ""(x + y)"" * (c1 && c2)); ```. ### Accessing the Histogram in Batch Mode.

Although you can do this with; hand inspection, or some ad-hoc method, this is a real pain and not very useful; for big programs. Using the ``Statistic`` class makes it very easy to keep; track of this information, and the calculated information is presented in a; uniform manner with the rest of the passes being executed. There are many examples of ``Statistic`` uses, but the basics of using it are as; follows:. Define your statistic like this:. .. code-block:: c++. #define DEBUG_TYPE ""mypassname"" // This goes after any #includes.; STATISTIC(NumXForms, ""The # of times I did stuff"");. The ``STATISTIC`` macro defines a static variable, whose name is specified by; the first argument. The pass name is taken from the ``DEBUG_TYPE`` macro, and; the description is taken from the second argument. The variable defined; (""NumXForms"" in this case) acts like an unsigned integer. Whenever you make a transformation, bump the counter:. .. code-block:: c++. ++NumXForms; // I did stuff!. That's all you have to do.

Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file; (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object; file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object; formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. . Not all tools support this format. For example, lld and the gold plugin will; ignore the ``.llvmbc`` section when linking object files, but can use; ``.llvm.lto`` sections when passed the correct command line options. .. _encoding of LLVM IR:.

In; this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and; then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all; the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an; entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the; procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```. To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type. ``` {.cpp}; > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --libs`; ```. and execute it by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > ./ExampleMacro; ```. This procedure will, however, not give access to the ROOT graphics, as; neither control of mouse or keyboard events nor access to the graphics; windows of ROOT is available. If you want your stand-alone application; have display graphics output and respond to mouse and keyboard, a; slightly more complex piece of code can be used. In the example below, a; macro `ExampleMacro_GUI` is executed by the ROOT class `TApplication`. As; a additional feature, this code example offers access to parameters; eventually passed to the program when started from the command line.; Here is the code fragment:. ``` {.cpp}; void StandaloneApplication(int argc, char** argv) {; // eventually, evaluate the application parameters argc, argv; // ==>> here the ROOT macro is called; ExampleMacro_GUI();; }; // This is the standard ""main"" of C++ starting; // a ROOT application; int main(int argc, char** argv) {; TApplication app(""ROOT A",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md:10952,config,config,10952,documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,1,['config'],['config']

Note that this transformation makes code much less readable, so it should only; be used in situations where the 'strip' utility would be used, such as reducing; code size or making it harder to reverse engineer code. ``tailcallelim``: Tail Call Elimination; ---------------------------------------. This file transforms calls of the current function (self recursion) followed by; a return instruction with a branch to the entry of the function, creating a; loop. This pass also implements the following extensions to the basic; algorithm:. #. Trivial instructions between the call and return do not prevent the; transformation from taking place, though currently the analysis cannot; support moving any really useful instructions (only dead ones).; #. This pass transforms functions that are prevented from being tail recursive; by an associative expression to use an accumulator variable, thus compiling; the typical naive factorial or fib implementation into efficient code.; #. TRE is performed if the function returns void, if the return returns the; result returned by the call, or if the function returns a run-time constant; on all exits from the function. It is possible, though unlikely, that the; return returns something else (like constant 0), and can still be TRE'd. It; can be TRE'd if *all other* return instructions in the function return the; exact same value.; #. If it can prove that callees do not access their caller stack frame, they; are marked as eligible for tail call elimination (by the code generator). Utility Passes; ==============.

Modifiability,"pings; ========. To be translated to or from a YAML mapping for your type T you must specialize; llvm::yaml::MappingTraits on T and implement the ""void mapping(IO &io, T&)""; method. If your native data structures use pointers to a class everywhere,; you can specialize on the class pointer. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. // Example of struct Foo which is used by value; template <>; struct MappingTraits<Foo> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Foo &foo) {; io.mapOptional(""size"", foo.size);; ...; }; };. // Example of struct Bar which is natively always a pointer; template <>; struct MappingTraits<Bar*> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Bar *&bar) {; io.mapOptional(""size"", bar->size);; ...; }; };. There are circumstances where we want to allow the entire mapping to be; read as an enumeration. For example, say some configuration option; started as an enumeration. Then it got more complex so it is now a; mapping. But it is necessary to support the old configuration files.; In that case, add a function ``enumInput`` like for; ``ScalarEnumerationTraits::enumeration``. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. struct FooBarEnum {; int Foo;; int Bar;; bool operator==(const FooBarEnum &R) const {; return Foo == R.Foo && Bar == R.Bar;; }; };. template <> struct MappingTraits<FooBarEnum> {; static void enumInput(IO &io, FooBarEnum &Val) {; io.enumCase(Val, ""OnlyFoo"", FooBarEnum({1, 0}));; io.enumCase(Val, ""OnlyBar"", FooBarEnum({0, 1}));; }; static void mapping(IO &io, FooBarEnum &Val) {; io.mapOptional(""Foo"", Val.Foo);; io.mapOptional(""Bar"", Val.Bar);; }; };. No Normalization; ----------------. The ``mapping()`` method is responsible, if needed, for normalizing and; denormalizing. In a simple case where the native data structure requires no; normalization, the mapping method just uses mapOptional() or mapRequired() to; bind the struct's fields to YAML key names. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llv",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst:15901,config,configuration,15901,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

The new interface, implemented in the class TProcPool, provides the possibility to perform in parallel a very generic set of tasks, described by macros, functions or lambdas. This illustrates the usage of lambdas:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TProcPool pool;; auto ten = pool.MapReduce([]() { return 1; }, 10, [](std::vector<int> v) { return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); }); }; ```.

Tutorials illustrating other usages of the new class TProcPool are available under tutorials/multicore. ## Language Bindings. ### Notebooks; We provided integration of ROOT with the Jupyter technology, integrating ROOT with Python Notebooks and providing a ROOT Kernel like functionality - de facto an enhanced C++ web based shell. Tab completion, output and graphics inlining have been added.

For a detail description of the GSL methods visit the GSL user guide; This class implements the best algorithms for numerical integration for one dimensional functions. We encourage the use it as the main option, bearing in mind that it uses code from the; GSL library, wich is provided in the *MathMore* library of ROOT. The interface to use is the same as above.

The algorithm is controlled by the given absolute and relative tolerance. The iterations are continued until the following condition is satisfied; $$; absErr <= max ( epsAbs, epsRel * Integral); $$; Where *absErr* is an estimate of the absolute error (it can be retrieved with `GSLIntegrator::Error()`) and *Integral* is the estimate of the function integral; (it can be obtained with `GSLIntegrator::Result()`). The possible integration algorithm types to use with the GSLIntegrator are the following.

These template arguments are; specified each time the class is inherited by another class or record. If a template argument is not assigned a default value with ``=``, it is; uninitialized (has the ""value"" ``?``) and must be specified in the template; argument list when the class is inherited (required argument). If an; argument is assigned a default value, then it need not be specified in the; argument list (optional argument). In the declaration, all required template; arguments must precede any optional arguments. The template argument default; values are evaluated from left to right. The :token:`RecordBody` is defined below. It can include a list of; parent classes from which the current class inherits, along with field; definitions and other statements. When a class ``C`` inherits from another; class ``D``, the fields of ``D`` are effectively merged into the fields of; ``C``. A given class can only be defined once. A ``class`` statement is; considered to define the class if *any* of the following are true (the; :token:`RecordBody` elements are described below). * The :token:`TemplateArgList` is present, or; * The :token:`ParentClassList` in the :token:`RecordBody` is present, or; * The :token:`Body` in the :token:`RecordBody` is present and not empty.

In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals. The; intention is to keep the interface as stable as possible even when the LLVM; optimizer continues to evolve. It should even be possible for a completely; different compilation technology to provide a different libLTO that works with; their object files and the standard linker tool. ``lto_module_t``; ----------------.

However, an exception is the normalization of ``-march``.; ``-march`` for Arm architectures contains a list of enabled and disabled; extensions and this list is likely to grow. Therefore ``-march`` flags are; unstable. Incomplete interface; --------------------.

LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default. Add ``REQUIRES_RTTI=1`` to your environment; while running ``make`` to re-enable it. This will allow users to build with; RTTI enabled and still inherit from LLVM classes. Shared Library; ==============. Configure with ``--enable-shared`` to build; ``libLLVM-<major>.<minor>.(so|dylib)`` and link the tools against it. This; saves lots of binary size at the cost of some startup time.

It has all traditional process; attributes, such as:. - Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID. - Environment. - Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread. When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This; thread is called the initial thread or the main thread.

For example, the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` sample rule that's defined in the previous section; will be evaluated using the following steps:. #. ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement``'s ``evaluate`` member function will be; called first. It will return an ``Expected<SourceRange>``. #. If the return value is an error the initiation will fail and the error; will be reported to the client. Note that the client may not report the; error to the user. #. Otherwise the source range return value will be used to construct the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` rule. The rule will then be invoked as the initiation; succeeded (all requirements were evaluated successfully). The same series of steps applies to any refactoring rule. Firstly, the engine; will evaluate all of the requirements. Then it will check if these requirements; are satisfied (they should not produce an error). Then it will construct the; rule and invoke it. The separation of requirements, their evaluation and the invocation of the; refactoring action rule allows the refactoring clients to:. - Disable refactoring action rules whose requirements are not supported. - Gather the set of options and define a command-line / visual interface; that allows users to input these options without ever invoking the; action. Selection Requirements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The refactoring rule requirements that require some form of source selection; are listed below:. - ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement`` evaluates to a source range when the; action is invoked with some sort of selection.

When translating a source language to LLVM, finding ways to express concepts; and guarantees available in your source language which are not natively; provided by LLVM IR will greatly improve LLVM's ability to optimize your code.; As an example, C/C++'s ability to mark every add as ""no signed wrap (nsw)"" goes; a long way to assisting the optimizer in reasoning about loop induction; variables and thus generating more optimal code for loops.

Add nsw/nuw flags as appropriate. Reasoning about overflow is; generally hard for an optimizer so providing these facts from the frontend; can be very impactful. #. Use fast-math flags on floating point operations if legal. If you don't; need strict IEEE floating point semantics, there are a number of additional; optimizations that can be performed.

If; you're building GWP-ASan outside of compiler-rt, simply ensure that you; specify ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""`` when building; ``optional/options_parser.cpp``). - By defining a ``__gwp_asan_default_options`` function in one's program that; returns the options string to be parsed.

The ROOT [reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html) is moving; to the Doxygen system. Doxygen is the de-facto standard for code documentation. It offers; many nice features we are now exploring and trying to get the best of them. Having; [MathJax rendered math formula](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSpectrum2.html#a482a7f144b9cc1b0405d0ac0d8cc9bbb); is one of them. The documentation can be structured in a more logical way; [using groups](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/modules.html). Still there is a lot; to do but big progresses have been done. We developed also a Doxygen filter allowing; to execute macros given as examples in the documentation and show the; [resulting picture directly in the documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP16). ## Tutorials. [The tutorials](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html) in; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` are also presented on the web thanks to Doxygen. They; are now part of the reference guide allowing nice cross-referencing with the; classes documentation. Here also a filter has been developed to generate; [the resulting picture](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/ContourList_8C.html). ## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure. ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. We added full support for C++14. Minor changes in the build system:. - Renamed build option POSTGRESQL_LIBRARIES to POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY; - Added build option `builtin_openssl` to build OpenSSL internally.

Control the usage of compact branches for MIPSR6. Valid values are: ``never``, ``optimal`` and ``always``.; The default value is ``optimal`` which generates compact branches; when a delay slot cannot be filled. ``never`` disables the usage of; compact branches and ``always`` generates compact branches whenever; possible. .. option:: -f[no-]max-type-align=[number]. Instruct the code generator to not enforce a higher alignment than the given; number (of bytes) when accessing memory via an opaque pointer or reference.; This cap is ignored when directly accessing a variable or when the pointee; type has an explicit “aligned” attribute. The value should usually be determined by the properties of the system allocator.; Some builtin types, especially vector types, have very high natural alignments;; when working with values of those types, Clang usually wants to use instructions; that take advantage of that alignment.

Modifiability,"ptions, we create a canvas with four; sub-pads. We will use one sub-pad for each `Draw` command. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas *myCanvas = new TCanvas(); root[] myCanvas->Divide(2,2); ```. We activate the first pad with the `TCanvas::cd` statement:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] myCanvas->cd(1); ```. We then draw the variable `Cost`:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] MyTree->Draw(""C; ```. As you can see, the last call `TTree::Draw` has only one parameter. It; is a string containing the leaf name. A histogram is automatically; created as a result of a `TTree::Draw`. The style of the histogram is; inherited from the **`TTree`** attributes and the current style; (***`gStyle`***) is ignored. The **`TTree`** gets its attributes from; the current **`TStyle`** at the time it was created. You can call the; method `TTree::UseCurrentStyle` to change to the current style rather; than the **`TTree`** style. (See ***`gStyle`***; see also ""Graphics and; the Graphical User Interface"" ). In the next segment, we activate the second pad and draw a scatter plot; variables:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] myCanvas->cd(2); root[] MyTree->Draw(""Cost:Age""); ```. This signature still only has one parameter, but it now has two; dimensions separated by a colon `(""x:y"")`. The item to be plotted can be; an expression not just a simple variable.

SetVector is also expensive to delete; elements out of (linear time), unless you use its ""pop_back"" method, which is; faster. ``SetVector`` is an adapter class that defaults to using ``std::vector`` and a; size 16 ``SmallSet`` for the underlying containers, so it is quite expensive.; However, ``""llvm/ADT/SetVector.h""`` also provides a ``SmallSetVector`` class,; which defaults to using a ``SmallVector`` and ``SmallSet`` of a specified size.; If you use this, and if your sets are dynamically smaller than ``N``, you will; save a lot of heap traffic. .. _dss_uniquevector:. llvm/ADT/UniqueVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. UniqueVector is similar to :ref:`SetVector <dss_setvector>` but it retains a; unique ID for each element inserted into the set. It internally contains a map; and a vector, and it assigns a unique ID for each value inserted into the set. UniqueVector is very expensive: its cost is the sum of the cost of maintaining; both the map and vector, it has high complexity, high constant factors, and; produces a lot of malloc traffic. It should be avoided. .. _dss_immutableset:. llvm/ADT/ImmutableSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

And I think we should not expect most of the checker; writers to add modeling of language constructs. So, in my opinion, it is ok to; have less nice/more verbose API for language modeling if we can have better; performance this way, since it only needs to be done once, and is done by the; framework developers. **Artem:** These are some great questions, i guess it'd be better to discuss; them more openly.

I'm thinking of AST matchers vs. AST visitors as a roughly; similar situation: matchers are not omnipotent, but they're so nice. * Separation between core and checkers is usually quite strange. Once we have; shared state traits, i generally wouldn't mind having region store or range; constraint manager as checkers (though it's probably not worth it to transform; them - just a mood). The main thing to avoid here would be the situation when; the checker overwrites stuff written by the core because it thinks it has a; better idea what's going on, so the core should provide a good default behavior. * Yeah, i totally care about performance as well, and if i try to implement; approach, i'd make sure it's good. **Artem:**. > Approach (2): We could teach the Store to scan itself for bindings to; > metadata-symbolic-based regions during scanReachableSymbols() whenever; > a region turns out to be reach",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/InitializerLists.rst:6537,extend,extend,6537,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/InitializerLists.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/InitializerLists.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']

Will oSUIF provide enough of an infrastructure to support the research; that we will be doing? We know that it has less than stellar; performance, but hope that this will be of little importance for our; static compiler. This could affect us if we decided to do some IP; research. Also we do not yet understand the level of exception support; currently implemented. 2. Should we consider the requirements of a direct hardware implementation; of the LLVM when we design it? If so, several design issues should; have their priorities shifted. The other option is to focus on a; software layer interpreting the LLVM in all cases. 3. Should we use some form of packetized format to improve forward; compatibility? For example, we could design the system to encode a; packet type and length field before analysis information, to allow a; runtime to skip information that it didn't understand in a bytecode; stream. The obvious benefit would be for compatibility, the drawback; is that it would tend to splinter that 'standard' LLVM definition. 4. Should we use fixed length instructions or variable length; instructions? Fetching variable length instructions is expensive (for; either hardware or software based LLVM runtimes), but we have several; 'infinite' spaces that instructions operate in (SSA register numbers,; type spaces, or packet length [if packets were implemented]). Several; options were mentioned including: ; A. Using 16 or 32 bit numbers, which would be 'big enough'; B. A scheme similar to how UTF-8 works, to encode infinite numbers; while keeping small number small.; C. Use something similar to Huffman encoding, so that the most common; numbers are the smallest. -Chris.

The `TTree::Draw` method can also be used to fill a specific histogram.; The syntax is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root""); root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack >> myHisto""); root[] myHisto->Print(); TH1.Print Name= myHisto, Entries= 100, Total sum= 100; ```. As we can see, this created a **`TH1`**, called `myHisto`. If you want; to append more entries to the histogram, you can use this syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack >>+ myHisto""); ```. If you do not create a histogram ahead of time, ROOT will create one at; the time of the Draw command (as is the case above). If you would like; to draw the variable into a specific histogram where you, for example,; set the range and bin number, you can define the histogram ahead of time; and use it in the Draw command. The histogram has to be in the same; directory as the tree. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1 *h1 = new TH1(""h1"",""h1"",50,0.,150.);; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack>> h1"");; ```. When you project a **`TTree`** into a histogram, the histogram inherits; the **`TTree`** attributes and not the current style attributes. This; allows you to project two Trees with different attributes into the same; picture. You can call the method `TTree::UseCurrentStyle` to change the; histogram to use the current style ***`gStyle`***. See ""Graphics and the; Graphical User Interface. The binning of the newly created histogram can be specified in two ways.; You can set a default in the `.rootrc` and/or you can add the binning; information in the `TTree::Draw` command.

Modifiability,"r their memory reference. X86 address spaces supported; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. x86 has a feature which provides the ability to perform loads and stores to; different address spaces via the x86 segment registers. A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases).

Modifiability,"r, because debug variable locations are defined for; every machine instruction, in effect every IR instruction uses every variable; location, which would lead to a large number of debugging intrinsics being; generated. Examining the example above, variable ``!30`` is assigned ``%input`` on both; conditional paths through the function, while ``!23`` is assigned differing; constant values on either path. Where control flow merges in ``%bb1`` we would; want ``!30`` to keep its location (``%input``), but ``!23`` to become undefined; as we cannot determine at runtime what value it should have in %bb1 without; inserting a PHI node. mem2reg does not insert the PHI node to avoid changing; codegen when debugging is enabled, and does not insert the other dbg.values; to avoid adding very large numbers of intrinsics. Instead, LiveDebugValues determines variable locations when control; flow merges. A dataflow analysis is used to propagate locations between blocks:; when control flow merges, if a variable has the same location in all; predecessors then that location is propagated into the successor. If the; predecessor locations disagree, the location becomes undefined. Once LiveDebugValues has run, every block should have all valid variable; locations described by DBG_VALUE instructions within the block. Very little; effort is then required by supporting classes (such as; DbgEntityHistoryCalculator) to build a map of each instruction to every; valid variable location, without the need to consider control flow. From; the example above, it is otherwise difficult to determine that the location; of variable ``!30`` should flow ""up"" into block ``%bb1``, but that the location; of variable ``!23`` should not flow ""down"" into the ``%exit`` block. .. _ccxx_frontend:.

Modifiability,"r. All; of these changes are isolated in the Kaleidoscope code generator. At this point in Kaleidoscope's development, it only supports variables; for two things: incoming arguments to functions and the induction; variable of 'for' loops. For consistency, we'll allow mutation of these; variables in addition to other user-defined variables. This means that; these will both need memory locations. To start our transformation of Kaleidoscope, we'll change the; ``NamedValues`` map so that it maps to AllocaInst\* instead of Value\*. Once; we do this, the C++ compiler will tell us what parts of the code we need; to update:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::map<std::string, AllocaInst*> NamedValues;. Also, since we will need to create these allocas, we'll use a helper; function that ensures that the allocas are created in the entry block of; the function:. .. code-block:: c++. /// CreateEntryBlockAlloca - Create an alloca instruction in the entry block of; /// the function.

This funny looking code creates an IRBuilder object that is pointing at; the first instruction (.begin()) of the entry block. It then creates an; alloca with the expected name and returns it. Because all values in; Kaleidoscope are doubles, there is no need to pass in a type to use. With this in place, the first functionality change we want to make belongs to; variable references. In our new scheme, variables live on the stack, so; code generating a reference to them actually needs to produce a load; from the stack slot:. .. code-block:: c++.

Modifiability,"r. In; order to support address spaces, the CFA DWARF expression is defined to be a; memory location description. This allows it to specify an address space which is; used to convert the offset address back to an address in that address space. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. This approach of extending memory location descriptions to support address; spaces, allows all existing DWARF Version 5 expressions to have the identical; semantics. It allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is; using. For example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a; swizzled manner when mapping a source language thread to the lane of a wavefront; in a SIMT manner. Or a compiler could choose to access it in an unswizzled; manner if mapping the same language with the wavefront being the thread. It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private; memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an; unswizzled manner, while using a swizzled private memory for SIMT variable; access. This approach also allows memory location descriptions for different address; spaces to be combined using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations. Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage. They give freedom to the; consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane; information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory location; description and no extra information. The same set of operations can operate on; locations independent of their kind of storage. The ``DW_OP_deref*`` therefore; can be used on any storage kind, including memory location descriptions of; different address spaces. Therefore, the ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations are; unnecessary, except to become a more compact way to encode a non-default address; space address followed by dereferencing it.

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value.

ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running. Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a; **`TFile`** object using the static method **`TFile::Open()`** object.; This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of **`TFile`** to handle the; request. Inheriting from the **`TFile`** class, the returned instance will have; exactly the same interface and behavior of **`TFile`**. The only difference; is that it reads and writes from a remote service.; In the example below the file is read via a web server through the TDavixFile plug-in. ### A Simple Session. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f1 = TFile::Open(""local/file.root"",""update""); root[] TFile *f2 = TFile::Open(""root://my.server.org/data/file.root"",""new""); root[] TFile *f3 = TFile::Open(""http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root""); root[] f3.ls(); TDavixFile** http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root; TDavixFile* http://root.cern.ch/files/hsimple.root; KEY: TH1F hpx;1 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH2F hpxpy;1 py vs px; KEY: TProfile hprof;1 Profile of pz versus px; KEY: TNtuple ntuple;1 Demo ntuple; root[] hpx.Draw(); ```. ## XML Interface.

The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) backend; --------------------------------------------------. Extended BPF (or eBPF) is similar to the original (""classic"") BPF (cBPF) used; to filter network packets. The; `bpf() system call <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html>`_; performs a range of operations related to eBPF. For both cBPF and eBPF; programs, the Linux kernel statically analyzes the programs before loading; them, in order to ensure that they cannot harm the running system. eBPF is; a 64-bit RISC instruction set designed for one to one mapping to 64-bit CPUs.; Opcodes are 8-bit encoded, and 87 instructions are defined.

Added correct treatment of extended term in asymptotically correct method for uncertainty determination in the presence of weights.; This improvement will allow for extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits to use the asymptotically correct method when using the `RooFit::AsymptoticError()` command argument in [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#ab0721374836c343a710f5ff92a326ff5).; See also this [writeup on extended weighted fits](https://root.cern/files/extended_weighted_fits.pdf) that is also linked from the reference guide.; The [pull request](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14751) that introduced this feature might also be a good reference. ### Compile your code with memory safe interfaces.

Prefix data is data associated with a function which the code; generator will emit immediately before the function's entrypoint.; The purpose of this feature is to allow frontends to associate; language-specific runtime metadata with specific functions and make it; available through the function pointer while still allowing the; function pointer to be called. To access the data for a given function, a program may bitcast the; function pointer to a pointer to the constant's type and dereference; index -1. This implies that the IR symbol points just past the end of; the prefix data. For instance, take the example of a function annotated; with a single ``i32``,. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @f() prefix i32 123 { ... }. The prefix data can be referenced as,. .. code-block:: llvm. %a = getelementptr inbounds i32, ptr @f, i32 -1; %b = load i32, ptr %a. Prefix data is laid out as if it were an initializer for a global variable; of the prefix data's type. The function will be placed such that the; beginning of the prefix data is aligned. This means that if the size; of the prefix data is not a multiple of the alignment size, the; function's entrypoint will not be aligned. If alignment of the; function's entrypoint is desired, padding must be added to the prefix; data. A function may have prefix data but no body. This has similar semantics; to the ``available_externally`` linkage in that the data may be used by the; optimizers but will not be emitted in the object file. .. _prologuedata:. Prologue Data; -------------. The ``prologue`` attribute allows arbitrary code (encoded as bytes) to; be inserted prior to the function body. This can be used for enabling; function hot-patching and instrumentation. To maintain the semantics of ordinary function calls, the prologue data must; have a particular format.

Atomic orderings; ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,; there are six levels of atomicity. They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not.

Modifiability,"ration value is passed in angle brackets as the template argument. Each; record will inherent the ``Value`` field with the appropriate enumeration; value. Here is a more complex example of classes with template arguments. First, we; define a class similar to the ``FPFormat`` class above. It takes a template; argument and uses it to initialize a field named ``Value``. Then we define; four records that inherit the ``Value`` field with its four different; integer values. .. code-block:: text. class ModRefVal <bits<2> val> {; bits<2> Value = val;; }. def None : ModRefVal<0>;; def Mod : ModRefVal<1>;; def Ref : ModRefVal<2>;; def ModRef : ModRefVal<3>;. This is somewhat contrived, but let's say we would like to examine the two; bits of the ``Value`` field independently. We can define a class that; accepts a ``ModRefVal`` record as a template argument and splits up its; value into two fields, one bit each. Then we can define records that inherit from; ``ModRefBits`` and so acquire two fields from it, one for each bit in the; ``ModRefVal`` record passed as the template argument. .. code-block:: text. class ModRefBits <ModRefVal mrv> {; // Break the value up into its bits, which can provide a nice; // interface to the ModRefVal values.; bit isMod = mrv.Value{0};; bit isRef = mrv.Value{1};; }. // Example uses.; def foo : ModRefBits<Mod>;; def bar : ModRefBits<Ref>;; def snork : ModRefBits<ModRef>;. This illustrates how one class can be defined to reorganize the; fields in another class, thus hiding the internal representation of that; other class. Running ``llvm-tblgen`` on the example prints the following definitions:. .. code-block:: text. def bar { // Value; bit isMod = 0;; bit isRef = 1;; }; def foo { // Value; bit isMod = 1;; bit isRef = 0;; }; def snork { // Value; bit isMod = 1;; bit isRef = 1;; }. ``let`` --- override fields in classes or records; -------------------------------------------------.

Modifiability,"ration, for example: a simple front-end that; parses for code generation must analyze the code for validity and emit code; in some intermediate form to pass off to a optimizer or backend. Because; validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly, there is; not hard requirement that the front-end actually build up a full AST for all; the expressions and statements in the code. TCC and GCC are examples of; compilers that either build no real AST (in the former case) or build a stripped; down and simplified AST (in the later case) because they focus primarily on; codegen.; On the opposite side of the spectrum, some clients (like refactoring) want; highly detailed information about the original source code and want a complete; AST to describe it with. Refactoring wants to have information about macro; expansions, the location of every paren expression '(((x)))' vs 'x', full; position information, and much more. Further, refactoring wants to look; across the whole program to ensure that it is making transformations; that are safe. Making this efficient and getting this right requires a; significant amount of engineering and algorithmic work that simply are; unnecessary for a simple static compiler.; The beauty of the clang approach is that it does not restrict how you use it.; In particular, it is possible to use the clang preprocessor and parser to build; an extremely quick and light-weight on-the-fly code generator (similar to TCC); that does not build an AST at all. As an intermediate step, clang supports; using the current AST generation and semantic analysis code and having a code; generation client free the AST for each function after code generation. Finally,; clang provides support for building and retaining fully-fledged ASTs, and even; supports writing them out to disk.; Designing the libraries with clean and simple APIs allows these high-level; policy decisions to be determined in the client, instead of forcing ""one true; way"" in the impleme",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:7894,refactor,refactoring,7894,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

It is best to keep your Visual Studio IDE build folder separate from the; Ninja build folder. This prevents the two build systems from negatively; interacting with each other. Once the ``compile_commands.json`` file has been created by Ninja, you can; use that compilation database with Clang Tooling. One caveat is that because; there are indirect settings obtained through the environment variables,; you may need to run any Clang Tooling executables through a command prompt; window created for use with Visual Studio as described above. An; alternative, e.g. for using the Visual Studio debugger on a Clang Tooling; executable, is to ensure that the environment variables are also visible; to the debugger settings. This can be done locally in Visual Studio's; debugger configuration locally or globally by launching the Visual Studio; IDE from a suitable command-prompt window.

In this case, if the I/O; operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage; of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk; space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression; may slow down the program's performance. The standard test program; `$ROOTSYS/test/Event` was used in various configurations with 400; events. The data file contains a **`TTree`**. The program was invoked; with:. ``` {.cpp}; Event 400 comp split; ```. - comp = 0 means: no compression at all.; - comp = 1 means: compress everything if split = 0.; - comp = 1 means: compress only the tree branches with integers if; split = 1.; - comp = 2 means: compress everything if split=1.; - split = 0 : the full event is serialized into one single buffer.; - split = 1 : the event is split into branches. One branch for each; data member of the Event class. The list of tracks (a; **`TClonesArray`**) has the data members of the Track class also; split into individual buffers. These tests were run on Pentium III CPU with 650 MHz. +------------+--------+---------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+; | Event | File | Total Time to | Effective | Total Time to | Total Time to |; | Parameters | Size | Write | Time to Write | Read All | Read Sample |; | | | (MB/sec) | (MB/sec) | (",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:136424,config,configurations,136424,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['config'],['configurations']

This version of ROOT adds an LLVM JIT event listener to create perf map files; during runtime. This allows profiling of interpreted/JITted code generated by; cling. Instead of function addresses, the perf data will contain full function; names. In addition, stack frame pointers are enabled in JITted code, so full; stack traces can be generated. Debugging is aided by switching off optimisations; and adding frame pointers for better stack traces. However, since both have a; runtime cost, they are disabled by default. Similar to `LD_DEBUG` and `LD_PROFILE`; for `ld.so`, the environment variables `CLING_DEBUG=1` and/or `CLING_PROFILE=1`; can be set to enable debugging and/or profiling. ### Other changes. - Shadowing of declarations in the `std` namespace is now diagnosed. Specifically, given that ROOT injects `using namespace std` directive, _all_ the names in the `std` namespace become available in the global scope. However, in some circumstances users inadvertently introduce a declaration that conflicts with a name in `std` making references to the former declaration result in ambiguous lookup.; A fairly common case is trying to declare a global variable named `data` which conflict with [`std::data`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/data) [C++17]. See [ROOT-5971](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-5971) for a discussion.; As of v6.28, such declarations result in; ```; root [] int data;; ROOT_prompt_0:1:1: warning: 'data' shadows a declaration with the same name in the 'std' namespace; use '::data' to reference this declaration; int data;; ^; ```. - Line editing at the ROOT interactive prom",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md:6195,variab,variables,6195,README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

If none of the aforementioned files are found, the driver will instead search; for separate driver and target configuration files and attempt to load both.; The former is named ``<driver>.cfg`` while the latter is named; ``<triple>.cfg``. Similarly to the previous variants, the canonical driver name; will be preferred, and the compiler will fall back to the actual name. For example, ``x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang-g++`` will attempt to load two; configuration files named respectively::. clang++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg. with fallback to trying::. clang-g++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg. It is not an error if either of these files is not found. The configuration file consists of command-line options specified on one or; more lines. Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash. Here is example of a; configuration file:. ::. # Several options on line; -c --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. # Long option split between lines; -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/../../../../\; include/c++/5.4.0. # other config files may be included; @linux.options. Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file.

Another method should be provided for the object to be painted, the; `Paint()` method. This is all explained in the next paragraph.

Modifiability,"re are several differences which can be noticed:; * \*modulemap files in $ROOTSYS/include -- those files are used by rootcling to; put a set of header files in a single pcm file. For example, all related; headers of *libGeom* are persisted in *Geom.pcm*. There are a few notable; examples, which are specific to the way we build ROOT. In certain cases we; want some header files to be compiled within C context or with RTTI on/off.; That's mostly for bootstrapping ROOT (aka rootcling stage1).; * modulemap.overlay.yaml -- automatically created virtual filesystem overlay; file. This file introduces C++ Modules for external dependencies.; For example, to 'modularize' glibc for ROOT we would need to place a modulemap; file in (usually) `/usr/include`. This folder is not writable on many; platforms. The vfs file tells the compiler to pretend there is a file at a; specific location. This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches.

This section presents the visualization technique available in ROOT; to represent multiple variables (>4) data sets. #### Spider (Radar) Plots. Spider plots (sometimes called “web-plots” or “radar plots”) are used; to compare series of data points (events). They use the human ability; to spot un-symmetry. ![Example of spider plot.](pictures/spider1.png). Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle.; For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and; the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for; an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult; to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view; of an event in order to compare it with the others.

Modifiability,"reas with the solution; above, the debugger will see one fewer combination of variable values, because; ``!3`` and ``!5`` will change value at the same time. This is preferred over; misrepresenting the original program. In comparison, if one sunk the MOV32rm, LLVM would produce the following:. .. code-block:: text. DBG_VALUE $noreg, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2. Here, to avoid presenting a state in which the first assignment to ``!1``; disappears, the DBG_VALUE at the top of the block assigns the variable the; undefined location, until its value is available at the end of the block where; an additional DBG_VALUE is added. Were any other DBG_VALUE for ``!1`` to occur; in the instructions that the MOV32rm was sunk past, the DBG_VALUE for ``%1``; would be dropped and the debugger would never observe it in the variable. This; accurately reflects that the value is not available during the corresponding; portion of the original program. Variable locations during Register Allocation; ---------------------------------------------. To avoid debug instructions interfering with the register allocator, the; LiveDebugVariables pass extracts variable locations from a MIR function and; deletes the corresponding DBG_VALUE instructions. Some localized copy; propagation is performed within blocks. After register allocation, the; VirtRegRewriter pass re-inserts DBG_VALUE instructions in their original; positions, translating virtual register references into their physical; machine locations. To avoid encoding incorrect variable locations, in this; pass any DBG_VALUE of a virtual register that is not live, is replaced by; the undefined location.

Status of the New and Legacy Pass Managers; ==========================================. LLVM currently contains two pass managers, the legacy PM and the new PM. The; optimization pipeline (aka the middle-end) uses the new PM, whereas the backend; target-dependent code generation uses the legacy PM. The legacy PM somewhat works with the optimization pipeline, but this is; deprecated and there are ongoing efforts to remove its usage. Some IR passes are considered part of the backend codegen pipeline even if; they are LLVM IR passes (whereas all MIR passes are codegen passes). This; includes anything added via ``TargetPassConfig`` hooks, e.g.; ``TargetPassConfig::addCodeGenPrepare()``. The ``TargetMachine::adjustPassManager()`` function that was used to extend a; legacy PM with passes on a per target basis has been removed. It was mainly; used from opt, but since support for using the default pipelines has been; removed in opt the function isn't needed any longer. In the new PM such; adjustments are done by using ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()``. Currently there are efforts to make the codegen pipeline work with the new; PM.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:21344,extend,extend,21344,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']

A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram; editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets; for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A; geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials; and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in; collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional; data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees. ### General Characteristics. The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to; `TObjects`, so:. - They can only hold objects that inherit from **`TObject`**. - They return pointers to `TObjects`, that have to be cast back to the; correct subclass. Collections are dynamic; they can grow in size as required. Collections; themselves are descendants of **`TObject`** so can themselves be held in; collections. It is possible to nest one type of collection inside; another to any level to produce structures of arbitrary complexity. Collections do not own the objects they hold for the very good reason; that the same object could be a member of more than one collection.; Object ownership is important when it comes to deleting objects; if; nobody owns the object it could end up as wasted memory (i.e. a memory; leak) when no longer needed.

Modifiability,"resent in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"". These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type). This type of directive has no security implications, but may present; performance impacts. Design Ideas; ============. This tool will disassemble binaries and DSO's from their machine code format and; analyse the disassembled machine code. The tool will inspect virtual calls and; indirect function calls. This tool will also inspect indirect jumps, as inlined; functions and jump tables should also be subject to CFI protections. Non-virtual; calls (``-fsanitize=cfi-nvcall``) and cast checks (``-fsanitize=cfi-*cast*``); are not implemented due to a lack of information provided by the bytecode. The tool would operate by searching for indirect control flow instructions in; the disassembly. A control flow graph would be generated from a small buffer of; the instructions surrounding the 'target' control flow instruction. If the; target instruction is branched-to, the fallthrough of the branch should be the; CFI trap (on x86, this is a ``ud2`` instruction).

In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there. Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations. If you look at the first indices in these GEP instructions you find that they; are different (0 and 1), therefore the address computation diverges with that; index. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: llvm. @MyVar = external global { [10 x i32] }; %idx1 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 0, i64 1; %idx2 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 1. In this example, ``idx1`` computes the address of the second integer in the; array that is in the structure in ``@MyVar``, that is ``MyVar+4``. However,; ``idx2`` computes the address of *the next* structure after ``@MyVar``, that is; ``MyVar+40``, because it indexes past the ten 4-byte integers in ``MyVar``.; Obviously, in such a situation, the pointers don't alias.

Modifiability,"rface to this service is; via abstract classes. ### Introspection, Reflection and Run Time Type Identification. Introspection, which is also referred to as reflection, or run time type; identification (RTTI) is the ability of a class to reflect upon itself; or to ""look inside itself. ROOT implements reflection with the; **`TClass`** class. It provides all the information about a class, a; full description of data members and methods, including the comment; field and the method parameter types. A class with the `ClassDef` macro; has the ability to obtain a **`TClass`** with the `IsA` method. ``` {.cpp}; TClass *cl = obj->IsA();; ```. It returns a **`TClass`**. In addition, an object can directly get the; class name and the base classes by:. ``` {.cpp}; const char* name = obj->ClassName();; ```. If the class is a descendent of **`TObject`**, you can check if an; object inherits from a specific class, you can use the `InheritsFrom`; method. This method returns `kTrue` if the object inherits from the; specified class name or **`TClass`**. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(""TLine"");; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(TLine::Class());; ```. ROOT and `Cling` rely on reflection and the class dictionary to identify; the type of a variable at run time. With **`TObject`** inheritance come; some methods that use Introspection to help you see the data in the; object or class. For instance:. ``` {.cpp}; obj->Dump(); // lists all data members and their current values; obj->Inspect(); // opens a window to browse data members; obj->DrawClass(); // Draws the class inheritance tree; ```. For an example of `obj->Inspect()`, see ""Inspecting Objects"". ### Collections. To store an object in a ROOT collection, it must be a descendent of; **`TObject`**. This is convenient if you want to store objects of; different classes in the same collection and execute the method of the; same name on all members of the collection. For example, the list of; graphics primitives are in a ROOT collection c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md:1294,inherit,inherits,1294,documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,1,['inherit'],['inherits']

This may require some; effort if an extensive caching infrastructure is used in your model. **3. Add translate():** RooFit classes are extended using a (typically) simple; `translate()` function that extracts the mathematically differentiable; properties out of the RooFit classes that make up the statistical model. The `translate()` function helps implement the Code Squashing logic that is; used to optimize numerical evaluations. It accomplishes this by using a small; subset of helper functions that are available in the; `RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext` and `RooFuncWrapper` classes; (see Appendix B). It converts a RooFit expression into a form that can be; efficiently evaluated by Clad. The `translate()` function returns an `std::string` representing the; underlying mathematical notation of the class as code, that can later be; concatenated into a single string representing the entire model. This string; of code is then just-in-time compiled by Cling (a C++ interpreter for Root). **4. analyticalIntegral() Use Case:** If your class includes (or should; include) the `analyticalIntegral()` function, then a simple; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function needs to be created to help call ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:8153,extend,extended,8153,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['extend'],['extended']
Modifiability,"rieties of garbage collectors. The Shadow Stack GC; ----------------------. To use this collector strategy, mark your functions with:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""shadow-stack"");. Unlike many GC algorithms which rely on a cooperative code generator to compile; stack maps, this algorithm carefully maintains a linked list of stack roots; [:ref:`Henderson2002 <henderson02>`]. This so-called ""shadow stack"" mirrors the; machine stack. Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple. (This code is heavily commented to help you understand the; data structure, but there are only 20 lines of meaningful code.). .. code-block:: c++. /// The map for a single function's stack frame. One of these is; /// compiled as constant data into the executable for each function.; ///; /// Storage of metadata values is elided if the %metadata parameter to; /// @llvm.gcroot is null.; struct FrameMap {; int32_t NumRoots; //< Number of roots in stack frame.; int32_t NumMeta; //< Number of metadata entries.

If your project deliberately uses unlocalized user-facing strings (for example, in a debugging UI that is never shown to users), you can suppress the analyzer warnings (and document your intent) with a function that just returns its input but is annotated to return a localized string:. __attribute__((annotate(""returns_localized_nsstring""))); static inline NSString *LocalizationNotNeeded(NSString *s) {; return s;; }. You can then call this function when creating your debugging UI:. [field setStringValue:LocalizationNotNeeded(@""Debug"")];. Some projects may also find it useful to use NSLocalizedString but add ""DNL"" or ""Do Not Localize"" to the string contents as a convention:. UILabel *testLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];; NSString *s = NSLocalizedString(@""Hello <Do Not Localize>"", @""For debug purposes"");; [testLabel setText:s];.

There may be an; easy way we can extend the support to make it work for your use case without; requiring a custom build. Collector Requirements; ----------------------. You should be able to leverage any existing collector library that includes the following elements:. #. A memory allocator which exposes an allocation function your compiled; code can call. #. A binary format for the stack map. A stack map describes the location; of references at a safepoint and is used by precise collectors to identify; references within a stack frame on the machine stack. Note that collectors; which conservatively scan the stack don't require such a structure. #. A stack crawler to discover functions on the call stack, and enumerate the; references listed in the stack map for each call site. #. A mechanism for identifying references in global locations (e.g. global; variables). #. If you collector requires them, an LLVM IR implementation of your collectors; load and store barriers. Note that since many collectors don't require; barriers at all, LLVM defaults to lowering such barriers to normal loads; and stores unless you arrange otherwise. Implementing a collector plugin; -------------------------------. User code specifies which GC code generation to use with the ``gc`` function; attribute or, equivalently, with the ``setGC`` method of ``Function``. To implement a GC plugin, it is necessary to subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy``,; which can be accomplished in a few lines of boilerplate code. LLVM's; infrastructure provides access to several important algorithms. For an; uncontroversial collector, all that remains may be to compile LLVM's computed; stack map to assembly code (using the binary representation expected by the; runtime library).

Modifiability,"ring the implementation. Implementation guidelines; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This section explains how to extend clang with the new functionality. **Parsing functionality**. If an extension modifies the standard parsing it needs to be added to; the clang frontend source code. This also means that the associated macro; indicating the presence of the extension should be added to clang. The default flow for adding a new extension into the frontend is to; modify `OpenCLExtensions.def; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/include/clang/Basic/OpenCLExtensions.def>`__,; containing the list of all extensions and optional features supported by; the frontend. This will add the macro automatically and also add a field in the target; options ``clang::TargetOptions::OpenCLFeaturesMap`` to control the exposure; of the new extension during the compilation. Note that by default targets like `SPIR-V`, `SPIR` or `X86` expose all the OpenCL; extensions. For all other targets the configuration has to be made explicitly. Note that the target extension support performed by clang can be overridden; with :option:`-cl-ext` command-line flags. .. _opencl_ext_libs:. **Library functionality**. If an extension adds functionality that does not modify standard language; parsing it should not require modifying anything other than header files and; ``OpenCLBuiltins.td`` detailed in :ref:`OpenCL builtins <opencl_builtins>`.; Most commonly such extensions add functionality via libraries (by adding; non-native types or functions) parsed regularly. Similar to other languages this; is the most common way to add new functionality. Clang has standard headers where new types and functions are being added,; for more details refer to; :ref:`the section on the OpenCL Header <opencl_header>`. The macros indicating; the presence of such extensions can be added in the standard header files; conditioned on target specific predefined macros or/and language version; predefined macros (see `feature",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst:9187,config,configuration,9187,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"rinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer.

The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```.

A real-world, production quality compiler. Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are; increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source; compilers have. Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and; built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people.

Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base.

The drawback; of this approach is that users of your parser have to be aware that they are; using your parser instead of the builtin ones. To guide the discussion, we will discuss a custom parser that accepts file; sizes, specified with an optional unit after the numeric size. For example, we; would like to parse ""102kb"", ""41M"", ""1G"" into the appropriate integer value. In; this case, the underlying data type we want to parse into is '``unsigned``'. We; choose approach #2 above because we don't want to make this the default for all; ``unsigned`` options. To start out, we declare our new ``FileSizeParser`` class:. .. code-block:: c++. struct FileSizeParser : public cl::parser<unsigned> {; // parse - Return true on error.; bool parse(cl::Option &O, StringRef ArgName, const std::string &ArgValue,; unsigned &Val);; };. Our new class inherits from the ``cl::parser`` template class to fill in; the default, boiler plate code for us. We give it the data type that we parse; into, the last argument to the ``parse`` method, so that clients of our custom; parser know what object type to pass in to the parse method. (Here we declare; that we parse into '``unsigned``' variables.). For most purposes, the only method that must be implemented in a custom parser; is the ``parse`` method. The ``parse`` method is called whenever the option is; invoked, passing in the option itself, the option name, the string to parse, and; a reference to a return value. If the string to parse is not well-formed, the; parser should output an error message and return true. Otherwise it should; return false and set '``Val``' to the parsed value. In our example, we; implement ``parse`` as:. .. code-block:: c++. bool FileSizeParser::parse(cl::Option &O, StringRef ArgName,; const std::string &Arg, unsigned &Val) {; const char *ArgStart = Arg.c_str();; char *End;. // Parse integer part, leavin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:63590,inherit,inherits,63590,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['inherit'],['inherits']

The only common features that the LLVM debugger assumes; exist are `source files <LangRef.html#difile>`_, and `program objects; <LangRef.html#diglobalvariable>`_. These abstract objects are used by a; debugger to form stack traces, show information about local variables, etc. This section of the documentation first describes the representation aspects; common to any source-language. :ref:`ccxx_frontend` describes the data layout; conventions used by the C and C++ front-ends.

Modifiability,"rmission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::AddFriend. A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method. The **`TTree`** (`tree`) below has two; friends (`ft1` and `ft2`) and now has access to the variables; `a,b,c,i,j,k,l` and `m`. ![](pictures/02000101.jpg). The `AddFriend` method has two parameters, the first is the tree name; and the second is the name of the ROOT file where the friend tree is; saved. `AddFriend` automatically opens the friend file. If no file name; is given, the tree called `ft1` is assumed to be in the same file as the; original tree. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. If the friend tree has the same name as the original tree, you can give; it an alias in the context of the friendship:. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""tree1 = tree"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. Once the tree has friends, we can use `TTree::Draw` as if the friend's; variables were in the original tree. To specify which tree to use in the; `Draw` method, use the syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; <treeName>.<branchname>.<varname>; ```. If the `variablename` is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you; can leave out the tree and/or branch name.

This can be used to ensure that content; created inside a pass outlives that pass's execution. .. _generic_link_algorithm:. Generic Link Algorithm; ======================. JITLink provides a generic link algorithm which can be extended / modified at; certain points by the introduction of JITLink :ref:`passes`. At the end of each phase the linker packages its state into a *continuation*; and calls the ``JITLinkContext`` object to perform a (potentially high-latency); asynchronous operation: allocating memory, resolving external symbols, and; finally transferring linked memory to the executing process. #. Phase 1. This phase is called immediately by the ``link`` function as soon as the; initial configuration (including the pass pipeline setup) is complete. #. Run pre-prune passes. These passes are called on the graph before it is pruned. At this stage; ``LinkGraph`` nodes still have their original vmaddrs. A mark-live pass; (supplied by the ``JITLinkContext``) will be run at the end of this; sequence to mark the initial set of live symbols. Notable use cases: marking nodes live, accessing/copying graph data that; will be pruned (e.g. metadata that's important for the JIT, but not needed; for the link process). #. Prune (dead-strip) the ``LinkGraph``. Removes all symbols and blocks not reachable from the initial set of live; symbols. This allows JITLink to remove unreachable symbols / content, including; overridden weak and redundant ODR definitions. #. Run post-prune passes. These passes are run on the graph after dead-stripping, but before memory; is allocated or nodes assigned their final target vmaddrs.

Modifiability,"rogramState. This immutability is key since the ExplodedGraph represents; the behavior of the analyzed program from the entry point. To; represent these efficiently, we use functional data structures (e.g.,; ImmutableMaps) which share data between instances. Finally, individual Checkers work by also manipulating the analysis; state. The analyzer engine talks to them via a visitor interface.; For example, the PreVisitCallExpr() method is called by ExprEngine; to tell the Checker that we are about to analyze a CallExpr, and the; checker is asked to check for any preconditions that might not be; satisfied. The checker can do nothing, or it can generate a new; ProgramState and ExplodedNode which contains updated checker state. If it; finds a bug, it can tell the BugReporter object about the bug,; providing it an ExplodedNode which is the last node in the path that; triggered the problem. = Notes about C++ =. Since now constructors are seen before the variable that is constructed; in the CFG, we create a temporary object as the destination region that; is constructed into. See ExprEngine::VisitCXXConstructExpr(). In ExprEngine::processCallExit(), we always bind the object region to the; evaluated CXXConstructExpr. Then in VisitDeclStmt(), we compute the; corresponding lazy compound value if the variable is not a reference, and; bind the variable region to the lazy compound value. If the variable; is a reference, just use the object region as the initializer value. Before entering a C++ method (or ctor/dtor), the 'this' region is bound; to the object region. In ctors, we synthesize 'this' region with; CXXRecordDecl*, which means we do not use type qualifiers. In methods, we; synthesize 'this' region with CXXMethodDecl*, which has getThisType(); taking type qualifiers into account. It does not matter we use qualified; 'this' region in one method and unqualified 'this' region in another; method, because we only need to ensure the 'this' region is consistent; when we synthesi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt:3824,variab,variable,3824,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"rotocol-qualifier mangling of parameters; ------------------------------------------------------------. Starting with LLVM 3.4, Clang produces a new mangling for parameters whose; type is a qualified-``id`` (e.g., ``id<Foo>``). This mangling allows such; parameters to be differentiated from those with the regular unqualified ``id``; type. This was a non-backward compatible mangling change to the ABI. This change; allows proper overloading, and also prevents mangling conflicts with template; parameters of protocol-qualified type. Query the presence of this new mangling with; ``__has_feature(objc_protocol_qualifier_mangling)``. Initializer lists for complex numbers in C; ==========================================. clang supports an extension which allows the following in C:. .. code-block:: c++. #include <math.h>; #include <complex.h>; complex float x = { 1.0f, INFINITY }; // Init to (1, Inf). This construct is useful because there is no way to separately initialize the; real and imaginary parts of a complex variable in standard C, given that clang; does not support ``_Imaginary``. (Clang also supports the ``__real__`` and; ``__imag__`` extensions from gcc, which help in some cases, but are not usable; in static initializers.). Note that this extension does not allow eliding the braces; the meaning of the; following two lines is different:. .. code-block:: c++. complex float x[] = { { 1.0f, 1.0f } }; // [0] = (1, 1); complex float x[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f }; // [0] = (1, 0), [1] = (1, 0). This extension also works in C++ mode, as far as that goes, but does not apply; to the C++ ``std::complex``. (In C++11, list initialization allows the same; syntax to be used with ``std::complex`` with the same meaning.). For GCC compatibility, ``__builtin_complex(re, im)`` can also be used to; construct a complex number from the given real and imaginary components. OpenCL Features; ===============.

Designing Type Hierarchies and Polymorphic Interfaces; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two different design patterns that tend to result in the use of; virtual dispatch for methods in a type hierarchy in C++ programs. The first is; a genuine type hierarchy where different types in the hierarchy model; a specific subset of the functionality and semantics, and these types nest; strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen in the ``Value``; or ``Type`` type hierarchies. A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of; polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be modeled with; virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract interface base class; which all implementations derive from and override. However, this; implementation strategy forces an **""is-a""** relationship to exist that is not; actually meaningful. There is often not some nested hierarchy of useful; generalizations which code might interact with and move up and down. Instead,; there is a singular interface which is dispatched across a range of; implementations. The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of; generic programming (sometimes called ""compile-time duck typing"" or ""static; polymorphism""). For example, a template over some type parameter ``T`` can be; instantiated across any particular implementation that conforms to the; interface or *concept*. A good example here is the highly generic properties of; any type which models a node in a directed graph. LLVM models these primarily; through templates and generic programming. Such templates include the; ``LoopInfoBase`` and ``DominatorTreeBase``.

There should no be reason to call a destructor directly in CPython, but e.g.; PyPy uses a garbage collector and that makes it sometimes useful to destruct; a C++ object exactly when you want it destroyed.; Destructors are by convention accessible through the ``__destruct__`` method; (since ""~"" can not be part of a Python method name).; If a Python-side derived class overrides ``__destruct__``, that method will; be called when the instance gets deleted in C++.; The Python destructor, ``__del__``, gets called when the Python proxy goes; away, which will only delete the C++ instance if owned by Python.; Note that ``__del__`` is not guaranteed to be called, it may e.g. be skipped; on program shutdown or because of an outstanding exception.; Accessing an object after it has been destroyed using ``__destruct__`` will; result in a Python ``ReferenceError`` exception. `Inheritance`; -------------. The output of help shows the inheritance hierarchy, constructors, public; methods, and public data.; For example, ``Concrete`` inherits from ``Abstract`` and it has; a constructor that takes an ``int`` argument, with a default value of 42.; Consider:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Abstract; >>> issubclass(Concrete, Abstract); True; >>> a = Abstract(); Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<console>"", line 1, in <module>; TypeError: cannot instantiate abstract class 'Abstract'; >>> c = Concrete(); >>> isinstance(c, Concrete); True; >>> isinstance(c, Abstract); True; >>> d = Concrete(13); >>>.

Some programmers use the 'restrict' keyword to notify the compiler that the; pointers are disjointed, but in our example, the Loop Vectorizer has no way of; knowing that the pointers A and B are unique. The Loop Vectorizer handles this; loop by placing code that checks, at runtime, if the arrays A and B point to; disjointed memory locations. If arrays A and B overlap, then the scalar version; of the loop is executed. .. code-block:: c++. void bar(float *A, float* B, float K, int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i); A[i] *= B[i] + K;; }. Reductions; ^^^^^^^^^^. In this example the ``sum`` variable is used by consecutive iterations of; the loop. Normally, this would prevent vectorization, but the vectorizer can; detect that 'sum' is a reduction variable. The variable 'sum' becomes a vector; of integers, and at the end of the loop the elements of the array are added; together to create the correct result. We support a number of different; reduction operations, such as addition, multiplication, XOR, AND and OR. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int *A, int n) {; unsigned sum = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i); sum += A[i] + 5;; return sum;; }. We support floating point reduction operations when `-ffast-math` is used. Inductions; ^^^^^^^^^^. In this example the value of the induction variable ``i`` is saved into an; array. The Loop Vectorizer knows to vectorize induction variables. .. code-block:: c++. void bar(float *A, int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i); A[i] = i;; }. If Conversion; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Modifiability,"rs in their data layout,; which may result in incompatibilities with the application binary interface; (ABI). Breaking the ABI complicates interoperability with external code that has; not adopted the same programming model. ``-fbounds-safety`` harmonizes the wide pointer and the bounds annotation; approaches to reduce the adoption burden while maintaining the ABI. In this; model, local variables of pointer type are implicitly treated as wide pointers,; allowing them to carry bounds information without requiring explicit bounds; annotations. Please note that this approach doesn't apply to function parameters; which are considered ABI-visible. As local variables are typically hidden from; the ABI, this approach has a marginal impact on it. In addition,; ``-fbounds-safety`` employs compile-time restrictions to prevent implicit wide; pointers from silently breaking the ABI (see `ABI implications of default bounds; annotations`_). Pointers associated with any other variables, including function; parameters, are treated as single object pointers (i.e., ``__single``), ensuring; that they always have the tightest bounds by default and offering a strong; bounds safety guarantee. By implementing default bounds annotations based on ABI visibility, a; considerable portion of C code can operate without modifications within this; programming model, reducing the adoption burden. The rest of the section will discuss individual bounds annotations and the; programming model in more detail. Bounds annotations; ------------------. Annotation for pointers to a single object; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C language allows pointer arithmetic on arbitrary pointers and this has been; a source of many bounds safety issues. In practice, many pointers are merely; pointing to a single object and incrementing or decrementing such a pointer; immediately makes the pointer go out-of-bounds. To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:6501,variab,variables,6501,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"rs.; Parallelism implies concurrency, but not vice-versa. A function is **`reentrant`** if it will behave correctly even if a; thread of execution enters the function while one or more threads are; already executing within the function. These could be the same thread,; in the case of recursion, or different threads, in the case of; concurrency. **`Thread-specific data`** (**`TSD`**) is also known as thread-local; storage (TLS). Normally, any data that has lifetime beyond the local; variables on the thread's private stack are shared among all threads; within the process. Thread-specific data is a form of static or global; data that is maintained on a per-thread basis. That is, each thread gets; its own private copy of the data. Left to their own devices, threads execute independently.; **`Synchronization`** is the work that must be done when there are, in; fact, interdependencies that require some form of communication among; threads. Synchronization tools include mutexes, semaphores, condition; variables, and other variations on locking. A **`critical section`** is a section of code that accesses a; non-sharable resource. To ensure correct code, only one thread at a time; may execute in a critical section. In other words, the section is not; reentrant. A **`mutex`**, or mutual exclusion lock, is a synchronization object; with two states locked and unlocked. A mutex is usually used to ensure; that only one thread at a time executes some critical section of code.; Before entering a critical section, a thread will attempt to lock the; mutex, which guards that section. If the mutex is already locked, the; thread will block until the mutex is unlocked, at which time it will; lock the mutex, execute the critical section, and unlock the mutex upon; leaving the critical section.

Modifiability,"rs; we will use a new context per module. Our last method is ``lookup``, which allows us to look up addresses for; function and variable definitions added to the JIT based on their symbol names.; As noted above, lookup will implicitly trigger compilation for any symbol; that has not already been compiled. Our lookup method calls through to; `ExecutionSession::lookup`, passing in a list of dylibs to search (in our case; just the main dylib), and the symbol name to search for, with a twist: We have; to *mangle* the name of the symbol we're searching for first. The ORC JIT; components use mangled symbols internally the same way a static compiler and; linker would, rather than using plain IR symbol names. This allows JIT'd code; to interoperate easily with precompiled code in the application or shared; libraries. The kind of mangling will depend on the DataLayout, which in turn; depends on the target platform. To allow us to remain portable and search based; on the un-mangled name, we just re-produce this mangling ourselves using our; ``Mangle`` member function object. This brings us to the end of Chapter 1 of Building a JIT.

The ``__sync_swap()`` builtin extends the existing ``__sync_*()`` family of; atomic intrinsics to allow code to atomically swap the current value with the; new value. More importantly, it helps developers write more efficient and; correct code by avoiding expensive loops around; ``__sync_bool_compare_and_swap()`` or relying on the platform specific; implementation details of ``__sync_lock_test_and_set()``. The; ``__sync_swap()`` builtin is a full barrier. ``__builtin_addressof``; -----------------------. ``__builtin_addressof`` performs the functionality of the built-in ``&``; operator, ignoring any ``operator&`` overload. This is useful in constant; expressions in C++11, where there is no other way to take the address of an; object that overloads ``operator&``.

The `Draw()`; method, here without any parameters, displays the function in a window; which should pop up after you typed the above two lines. A slightly extended version of this example is the definition of a; function with parameters, called `[0]`, `[1]` and so on in the ROOT; formula syntax.

The problem with C (again, in its full generality) is that it is heavily; laden with target specific assumptions. As one simple example, the; preprocessor often destructively removes target-independence from the; code when it processes the input text:. .. code-block:: c. #ifdef __i386__; int X = 1;; #else; int X = 42;; #endif. While it is possible to engineer more and more complex solutions to; problems like this, it cannot be solved in full generality in a way that; is better than shipping the actual source code. That said, there are interesting subsets of C that can be made portable.; If you are willing to fix primitive types to a fixed size (say int =; 32-bits, and long = 64-bits), don't care about ABI compatibility with; existing binaries, and are willing to give up some other minor features,; you can have portable code.

Safety is an interesting; property that requires a combination of language design, runtime; support, and often operating system support. It is certainly possible to implement a safe language in LLVM, but LLVM; IR does not itself guarantee safety. The LLVM IR allows unsafe pointer; casts, use after free bugs, buffer over-runs, and a variety of other; problems. Safety needs to be implemented as a layer on top of LLVM and,; conveniently, several groups have investigated this.

(Remember, the original; Value is unmodified by the safepoint.) The compiler is free to make; either scheduling choice. The actual correctness property implemented is slightly stronger than; this. We require that there be no *static path* on which a; potentially relocated pointer is 'observably-after' it may have been; relocated. This is slightly stronger than is strictly necessary (and; thus may disallow some otherwise valid programs), but greatly; simplifies reasoning about correctness of the compiled code.

A structure that helps ``MemorySSA`` do its job is the ``MemorySSAWalker``, or; the walker, for short. The goal of the walker is to provide answers to clobber; queries beyond what's represented directly by ``MemoryAccess``\ es. For example,; given:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() {; %a = alloca i8; %b = alloca i8. ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); store i8 0, ptr %a; ; 2 = MemoryDef(1); store i8 0, ptr %b; }. The store to ``%a`` is clearly not a clobber for the store to ``%b``. It would; be the walker's goal to figure this out, and return ``liveOnEntry`` when queried; for the clobber of ``MemoryAccess`` ``2``. By default, ``MemorySSA`` provides a walker that can optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s; and ``MemoryUse``\ s by consulting whatever alias analysis stack you happen to; be using. Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached.

Note that the term *class* refers to an abstract record; class, while the term *record* refers to a concrete record. Unless otherwise noted, functions associated with classes are instance; functions. ``RecordKeeper``; ----------------. An instance of the ``RecordKeeper`` class acts as the container for all the; classes and records parsed and collected by TableGen. The ``RecordKeeper``; instance is passed to the backend when it is invoked by TableGen. This class; is usually abbreviated ``RK``. There are two maps in the recordkeeper, one for classes and one for records; (the latter often referred to as *defs*). Each map maps the class or record; name to an instance of the ``Record`` class (see `Record`_), which contains; all the information about that class or record. In addition to the two maps, the ``RecordKeeper`` instance contains:. * A map that maps the names of global variables to their values.; Global variables are defined in TableGen files with outer; ``defvar`` statements. * A counter for naming anonymous records. The ``RecordKeeper`` class provides a few useful functions. * Functions to get the complete class and record maps. * Functions to get a subset of the records based on their parent classes. * Functions to get individual classes, records, and globals, by name.

The ``amdgcn`` value is selected to avoid dynamic stack alignment for the; OpenCL language which has the largest base type defined as 16 bytes.

The function may use positive offsets beyond the last stack passed argument; for stack allocated local variables and register spill slots. If necessary,; the function may align these to greater alignment than 16 bytes. After these; the function may dynamically allocate space for such things as runtime sized; ``alloca`` local allocations.

The clang-refactor tool will then analyze; the selection and other options passed to the refactoring action, and will pick; the most appropriate rule for the given selection and other options. Rule Types; ^^^^^^^^^^. Clang's refactoring engine supports several different refactoring rules:. - ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` produces source replacements that are applied; to the source files. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to; implement the ``createSourceReplacements`` member function. This type of; rule is typically used to implement local refactorings that transform the; source in one translation unit only. - ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` produces a ""partial"" refactoring; result: a set of occurrences that refer to a particular symbol. This type; of rule is typically used to implement an interactive renaming action that; allows users to specify which occurrences should be renamed during the; refactoring. Subclasses that choose to implement this rule have to implement; the ``findSymbolOccurrences`` member function. The following set of quick checks might help if you are unsure about the type; of rule you should use:. #. If you would like to transform the source in one translation unit and if; you don't need any cross-TU information, then the; ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` should work for you. #. If you would like to implement a rename-like operation with potential; interactive components, then ``FindSymbolOccurrencesRefactoringRule`` might; work for you. How to Create a Rule; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once you determine which type of rule is suitable for your needs you can; implement the refactoring by subclassing the rule and implementing its; interface. The subclass should have a constructor that takes the inputs that; are needed to perform the refactoring.

A ``std::vector`` is the most commonly used C++ container type because it is; more efficient and performant than specialized types such as ``list`` and; ``map``, unless the number of elements gets very large.; Python has several similar types, from the builtin ``tuple`` and ``list``,; the ``array`` from builtin module ``array``, to ""as-good-as-builtin""; ``numpy.ndarray``.; A vector is more like the latter two in that it can contain only one type,; but more like the former two in that it can contain objects.; In practice, it can interplay well with all these containers, but e.g.; efficiency and performance can differ significantly. A vector can be instantiated from any sequence, including generators, and; vectors ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst:1819,variab,variables,1819,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"s can be set by `TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n)`.; Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries; is null. ### Viewing the Tree. ![The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram](pictures/030000FC.png). In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: `ev`,; `px`, `py`, `pz`, and `random`. Note that these are shown as leaves; because they are ""end"" branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf,; we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree; `t1` looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other; operations for histogramming the leaves. See ""The Tree Viewer"". For; example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram. ![The tree viewer](pictures/030000FE.png). ### Reading the Tree. The `tree1r` function shows how to read the tree and access each entry; and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values. ``` {.cpp}; Float_t px, py, pz;; ```. Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry.; We do this with the method `TTree::SetBranchAddress`. The first; parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the; variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the; branch name is `px`. This name was given when the tree was written (see; `tree1w`). The second parameter is the address of the variable `px`. ``` {.cpp}; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; ```. #### GetEntry. Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be; read into the variables with the method `TTree::GetEntry(n)`. It; reads all the branches for entry (n) and populates the given address; accordingly. By default, `GetEntry()` reuses the space allocated by the; previous object for each branch. You can force the previous object to be; automatically deleted if you call `mybranch.SetAutoDelete(kTRUE)`; (default is `kFALSE`). Consider the example in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.h`. The top-level branch in; the tree `T` is declared with:. `",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:38178,variab,variables,38178,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"s can go *either way*, but they have to come from one; of the two operands. In the ``%A`` example, if ``%X`` and ``%Y`` were; both known to have a clear low bit, then ``%A`` would have to have a; cleared low bit. However, in the ``%C`` example, the optimizer is; allowed to assume that the '``undef``' operand could be the same as; ``%Y`` if ``%Y`` is provably not '``poison``', allowing the whole '``select``'; to be eliminated. This is because '``poison``' is stronger than '``undef``'. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = xor undef, undef. %B = undef; %C = xor %B, %B. %D = undef; %E = icmp slt %D, 4; %F = icmp gte %D, 4. Safe:; %A = undef; %B = undef; %C = undef; %D = undef; %E = undef; %F = undef. This example points out that two '``undef``' operands are not; necessarily the same. This can be surprising to people (and also matches; C semantics) where they assume that ""``X^X``"" is always zero, even if; ``X`` is undefined. This isn't true for a number of reasons, but the; short answer is that an '``undef``' ""variable"" can arbitrarily change; its value over its ""live range"". This is true because the variable; doesn't actually *have a live range*. Instead, the value is logically; read from arbitrary registers that happen to be around when needed, so; the value is not necessarily consistent over time. In fact, ``%A`` and; ``%C`` need to have the same semantics or the core LLVM ""replace all; uses with"" concept would not hold. To ensure all uses of a given register observe the same value (even if; '``undef``'), the :ref:`freeze instruction <i_freeze>` can be used. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = sdiv undef, %X; %B = sdiv %X, undef; Safe:; %A = 0; b: unreachable. These examples show the crucial difference between an *undefined value*; and *undefined behavior*. An undefined value (like '``undef``') is; allowed to have an arbitrary bit-pattern. This means that the ``%A``; operation can be constant folded to '``0``', because the '``undef``'; could be zero, and zero divided by any value is zer",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:194014,variab,variable,194014,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Order; between failure states is determined by inclusion relation on the set of; accumulated violations (lattice's `⩽` is `⊆` on the set of violations). Order; between normal states is determined by reversed inclusion relation on the set of; overwritten parameter's member fields (lattice's `⩽` is `⊇` on the set of; overwritten fields). ![Lattice for data flow analysis that identifies output parameters](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/OutputParameterIdentificationLattice.svg). To determine whether a statement reads or writes a field we can implement; symbolic evaluation of `DeclRefExpr`s, `LValueToRValue` casts, pointer; dereference operator and `MemberExpr`s. ### Using data flow results to identify output parameters. Let's take a look at how we use data flow analysis to identify an output; parameter. The refactoring can be safely done when the data flow algorithm; computes a normal state with all of the fields proven to be overwritten in the; exit basic block of the function. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; };. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; } else {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; ```. When the data flow algorithm computes a normal state, but not all fields are; proven to be overwritten we can't perform the refactoring. ```c++; void target(bool b, Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; if (b) {; c->account_id = 42; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; } else {; c->name = ""Konrad""; // Overwritten: {c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {}; }; ```. Similarly, when the data flow algorithm computes a failure state, we also can't; perform the refactoring. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:18349,refactor,refactoring,18349,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

Array to pointer promotion to secure arrays (including VLAs); ------------------------------------------------------------. Arrays on function prototypes; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, arrays on function prototypes are promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to; its first element (e.g., ``&arr[0]``). In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs).

This means the array parameters are treated as `__counted_by` pointers within; the function and callers of the function also see them as the corresponding; `__counted_by` pointers. Incomplete arrays on function prototypes will cause a compiler error unless it; has ``__counted_by`` annotation in its bracket. .. code-block:: c. void f1(int n, int arr[]); // error. void f3(int n, int arr[__counted_by(n)]); // ok. void f2(int n, int arr[n]); // ok, decays to int *__counted_by(n). void f4(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr); // ok. void f5(int n, int *arr); // ok, but decays to int *__single,;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:32571,variab,variable-length,32571,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['variab'],['variable-length']

This enables features such as implicitly discovered,; explicitly built modules. ..; TODO: Create and link corresponding section in Modules.rst. Adding new Command Line Option; ------------------------------. When adding a new command line option, the first place of interest is the header; file declaring the corresponding options class (e.g. ``CodeGenOptions.h`` for; command line option that affects the code generation). Create new member; variable for the option value:. .. code-block:: diff. class CodeGenOptions : public CodeGenOptionsBase {. + /// List of dynamic shared object files to be loaded as pass plugins.; + std::vector<std::string> PassPlugins;. }. Next, declare the command line interface of the option in the tablegen file; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/Options.td``. This is done by instantiating the; ``Option`` class (defined in ``llvm/include/llvm/Option/OptParser.td``). The; instance is typically created through one of the helper classes that encode the; acceptable ways to specify the option value on the command line:. * ``Flag`` - the option does not accept any value,; * ``Joined`` - the value must immediately follow the option name within the same; argument,; * ``Separate`` - the value must follow the option name in the next command line; argument,; * ``JoinedOrSeparate`` - the value can be specified either as ``Joined`` or; ``Separate``,; * ``CommaJoined`` - the values are comma-separated and must immediately follow; the option name within the same argument (see ``Wl,`` for an example).

What's New in Clang |release|?; ==============================; Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed; here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying; infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific; sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages. C++ Language Changes; --------------------. C++20 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P1907R1 <https://wg21.link/P1907R1>`_ which extends allowed non-type template argument; kinds with e.g. floating point values and pointers and references to subobjects.; This feature is still experimental. Accordingly, ``__cpp_nontype_template_args`` was not updated.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_generalized_nttp)``. - Clang won't perform ODR checks for decls in the global module fragment any; more to ease the implementation and improve the user's using experience.; This follows the MSVC's behavior. Users interested in testing the more strict; behavior can use the flag '-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf'.; (`#79240 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79240>`_).

Modifiability,"s have been added for discrete-valued functions catfunc(); and stored category functions are now also printed under their own heading in Print(); Parameterized ranges. It is now possible to use RooAbsReal derived functions as range definition for variables; to construct ranges that vary as function of another variable. For example. RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; RooRealVar y(""y"",""y"",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; ; RooFormulaVar x_lo(""x_lo"",""y-20"",y) ; ; RooFormulaVar x_hi(""x_hi"",""sin(y)*5"",y) ; ; x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ; // Change x to have variable range depending on y; ; It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way. x.setRange(""signalRegion"",x_lo,x_hi) ;. There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges; that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables ; x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z; and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z); over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into; account. A definition of a range 'R' on the other hand where the bounds of x depend on y and; the bounds of y depend on x is not allowed, and an error message will be printed to complain about; the ambiguity of the problem definition. Integrals over non-rectangular regions are created the; same way as integrals over rectangular regions using the RooAbsReal::createIntegral() function, the; chosen mode of operation depends on the shape of the requestion integration range. Note that in general integration over non (hyper)rectangular regions will be more computationally; intensive as only a subset of the observables can be integrated analytically (all of those that do not; have parameterized ranges plus those that have parameterized ranges but are not involved in",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:3978,parameteriz,parameterized,3978,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterized']
Modifiability,"s in most contexts unusable, because the input; can't be changed, other than loading a different bin in the dataset. Furthermore, there was actually a constructor that took a `RooAbsArg x`, but it; was simply ignored. To fix all these problems, the existing constructors were replaced by a new one; that takes the observable explicitly. Since the old constructors resulted in wrong computation graphs that caused; trouble with the new CPU evaluation backend, they had to be removed without; deprecation. Please adapt your code if necessary. ### Renaming of some RooFit classes. The `RooPower` was renamed to `RooPowerSum`, and `RooExpPoly` was renamed to `RooLegacyExpPoly`. This was a necessary change, because the names of these classes introduced in ROOT 6.28 collided with some classes in CMS combine, which were around already long before. Therefore, the classes had to be renamed to not cause any problems for CMS. In the unlikeliy case where you should have used these new classes for analysis already, please adapt your code to the new names and re-create your workspaces. ## RDataFrame. * The `RDataFrame` constructors that take in input one or more file names (or globs thereof) will now infer the format of the dataset, either `TTree` or `RNTuple`, that is stored in the first input file. When multiple files are specified, it is assumed that all other files contain a coherent dataset of the same format and with the same schema, exactly as it used to happen with `TChain`. This automatic inference further contributes towards a zero-code-change experience when moving from processing a `TTree` to processing an `RNTuple` dataset while using an `RDataFrame`. It also introduces a backwards-incompatible behaviour, i.e. now the constructor needs to open one file in order to infer the dataset type. This means that if the file does not exist, the constructor will throw an exception. Previously, an exception would be thrown only at a JIT-ting time, before the start of the computations.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:14375,adapt,adapt,14375,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['adapt'],['adapt']

For this purpose we can use lattice in a form of a mapping from variable; declarations to initialization states; each initialization state is represented; by the following lattice:. ![Lattice for definitive initialization analysis](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/DefinitiveInitializationLattice.svg). A lattice element could also capture the source locations of the branches that; lead us to the corresponding program point. Diagnostics would use this; information to show a sample buggy code path to the user. ## Example: refactoring raw pointers to `unique_ptr`. Modern idiomatic C++ uses smart pointers to express memory ownership, however in; pre-C++11 code one can often find raw pointers that own heap memory blocks. Imagine that we would like to refactor raw pointers that own memory to; `unique_ptr`. There are multiple ways to design a data flow analysis for this; problem; let's look at one way to do it. For example, we would like to refactor the following code that uses raw; pointers:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi = new int;; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; delete pi;; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi);; }; }; ```. into code that uses `unique_ptr`:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; auto pi = std::make_unique<int>();; if (...) {; Borrow(pi.get());; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi.release());; }; }; ```. This problem can be solved with a lattice in form of map from value declarations; to pointer states:. ![Lattice that identifies candidates for unique_ptr refactoring](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/UniquePtrLattice.svg). We can perform the refactoring if at the exit of a function `pi` is; `Compatible`. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi; // pi is Compatible; pi = new int; // pi is Defined; if (...) {; Borrow(pi); // pi is Defined; delet",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:21665,refactor,refactor,21665,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['refactor'],['refactor']
Modifiability,"s into SSA values, which can; eventually be placed in physical registers or memory locations. To track SSA; values through compilation, when objects are promoted to SSA values an; ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic is created for each assignment, recording the; variable's new location. Compared with the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic:. * A dbg.value terminates the effect of any preceding dbg.values for (any; overlapping fragments of) the specified variable.; * The dbg.value's position in the IR defines where in the instruction stream; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value. Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer. Withholding; these potentially stale variable values from the developer diminishes the; amount of available debug information, but increases the reliability of the; remaining information. To illustrate some potential issues, consider the following example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @foo(i32 %bar, i1 %cond) {; entry:; call @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 0, metadata !1, metadata !2); b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:18992,variab,variable,18992,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Other languages, such as; ``C++``, ensure that only equivalent globals are ever merged (the; ""one definition rule"" --- ""ODR""). Such languages can use the; ``linkonce_odr`` and ``weak_odr`` linkage types to indicate that the; global will only be merged with equivalent globals. These linkage; types are otherwise the same as their non-``odr`` versions.; ``external``; If none of the above identifiers are used, the global is externally; visible, meaning that it participates in linkage and can be used to; resolve external symbol references.

Modifiability,"s likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs. An example of this is keeping a simple; relationship between flag names and command line options where possible.; Since the command line options are part of a stable API they are unlikely; to change, and therefore the flag names get the same stability.

For example, if the user specifies; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m4`` the toolchain can choose a directory; containing headers and libraries suitable for Armv7E-M, because it knows that's; a suitable architecture for Arm Cortex-M4.; Multilib can also choose between libraries for the same architecture based on; other options. For example if the user specifies ``-fno-exceptions`` then a; toolchain could select libraries built without exception support, thereby; reducing the size of the resulting binary. Design; ======. Clang supports GCC's ``-print-multi-lib`` and ``-print-multi-directory``; options.

Modifiability,"s on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules.

Modifiability,"s some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size. This causes lots of redundant no-op bitcasts; in the IR to and from a pointer with a different pointee type. No-op bitcasts take up memory/disk space and also take up compile time to look; through. However, perhaps the biggest issue is the code complexity required ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:2934,evolve,evolved,2934,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['evolve'],['evolved']

For example in:. .. code-block:: llvm. b = MemoryDef(a); c = MemoryDef(b); d = MemoryDef(c). ``d`` is connected directly with ``c`` and indirectly with ``b``.; This means that ``d`` potentially clobbers (see below) ``c`` *or*; ``b`` *or* both. This in turn implies that without the use of `The walker`_,; initially every ``MemoryDef`` clobbers every other ``MemoryDef``. ``MemoryPhi``\ s are ``PhiNode``\ s, but for memory operations. If at any; point we have two (or more) ``MemoryDef``\ s that could flow into a; ``BasicBlock``, the block's top ``MemoryAccess`` will be a; ``MemoryPhi``. As in LLVM IR, ``MemoryPhi``\ s don't correspond to any; concrete operation. As such, ``BasicBlock``\ s are mapped to ``MemoryPhi``\ s; inside ``MemorySSA``, whereas ``Instruction``\ s are mapped to ``MemoryUse``\ s; and ``MemoryDef``\ s. Note also that in SSA, Phi nodes merge must-reach definitions (that is,; definitions that *must* be new versions of variables). In MemorySSA, PHI nodes; merge may-reach definitions (that is, until disambiguated, the versions that; reach a phi node may or may not clobber a given variable). ``MemoryUse``\ s are operations which use but don't modify memory. An example of; a ``MemoryUse`` is a ``load``, or a ``readonly`` function call. Every function that exists has a special ``MemoryDef`` called ``liveOnEntry``.; It dominates every ``MemoryAccess`` in the function that ``MemorySSA`` is being; run on, and implies that we've hit the top of the function. It's the only; ``MemoryDef`` that maps to no ``Instruction`` in LLVM IR. Use of; ``liveOnEntry`` implies that the memory being used is either undefined or; defined before the function begins. An example of all of this overlaid on LLVM IR (obtained by running ``opt; -passes='print<memoryssa>' -disable-output`` on an ``.ll`` file) is below. When; viewing this example, it may be helpful to view it in terms",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:3438,variab,variables,3438,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"s that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space. Stack variables; work the same way, except that instead of being declared with global; variable definitions, they are declared with the `LLVM alloca; instruction <../../LangRef.html#alloca-instruction>`_:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @example() {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; ...; %tmp = load i32, i32* %X ; load the stack value %X from the stack.; %tmp2 = add i32 %tmp, 1 ; increment it; store i32 %tmp2, i32* %X ; store it back; ... This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR. Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:4518,variab,variables,4518,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"
Modifiability,"s the ability of a class to reflect upon itself; or to ""look inside itself. ROOT implements reflection with the; **`TClass`** class. It provides all the information about a class, a; full description of data members and methods, including the comment; field and the method parameter types. A class with the `ClassDef` macro; has the ability to obtain a **`TClass`** with the `IsA` method. ``` {.cpp}; TClass *cl = obj->IsA();; ```. It returns a **`TClass`**. In addition, an object can directly get the; class name and the base classes by:. ``` {.cpp}; const char* name = obj->ClassName();; ```. If the class is a descendent of **`TObject`**, you can check if an; object inherits from a specific class, you can use the `InheritsFrom`; method. This method returns `kTrue` if the object inherits from the; specified class name or **`TClass`**. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(""TLine"");; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(TLine::Class());; ```. ROOT and `Cling` rely on reflection and the class dictionary to identify; the type of a variable at run time. With **`TObject`** inheritance come; some methods that use Introspection to help you see the data in the; object or class. For instance:. ``` {.cpp}; obj->Dump(); // lists all data members and their current values; obj->Inspect(); // opens a window to browse data members; obj->DrawClass(); // Draws the class inheritance tree; ```. For an example of `obj->Inspect()`, see ""Inspecting Objects"". ### Collections. To store an object in a ROOT collection, it must be a descendent of; **`TObject`**. This is convenient if you want to store objects of; different classes in the same collection and execute the method of the; same name on all members of the collection. For example, the list of; graphics primitives are in a ROOT collection called **`TList`**. When; the canvas is drawn, the `Paint` method is executed on the entire; collection. Each member may be a different class, and if the `Paint`; method is not implemented, **`TObject::Paint`*",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md:1543,variab,variable,1543,documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"s the call; operation, E can use, and/or remove entries already on the stack, and can; add new entries to the stack. *Values on the stack at the time of the call may be used as parameters by; the called expression and values left on the stack by the called expression; may be used as return values by prior agreement between the calling and; called expressions.*. * If D has a ``DW_AT_location`` attribute that is encoded as a ``loclist`` or; ``loclistsptr``, then the specified location list expression E is; evaluated. The evaluation of E uses the current context, except the result; kind is a location description, the compilation unit is the one that; contains D, and the initial stack is empty. The location description; result is pushed on the stack. .. note::. This rule avoids having to define how to execute a matched location list; entry operation expression on the same stack as the call when there are; multiple matches. But it allows the call to obtain the location; description for a variable or formal parameter which may use a location; list expression. An alternative is to treat the case when D has a ``DW_AT_location``; attribute that is encoded as a ``loclist`` or ``loclistsptr``, and the; specified location list expression E' matches a single location list; entry with operation expression E, the same as the ``exprloc`` case and; evaluate on the same stack. But this is not attractive as if the attribute is for a variable that; happens to end with a non-singleton stack, it will not simply put a; location description on the stack. Presumably the intent of using; ``DW_OP_call*`` on a variable or formal parameter debugger information; entry is to push just one location description on the stack. That; location description may have more than one single location description. The previous rule for ``exprloc`` also has the same problem, as normally; a variable or formal parameter location expression may leave multiple; entries on the stack and only return the top entry.

Modifiability,"s the; primary interface to classes providing object I/O, error handling,; inspection, introspection, and drawing. The interface to this service is; via abstract classes. ### Introspection, Reflection and Run Time Type Identification. Introspection, which is also referred to as reflection, or run time type; identification (RTTI) is the ability of a class to reflect upon itself; or to ""look inside itself. ROOT implements reflection with the; **`TClass`** class. It provides all the information about a class, a; full description of data members and methods, including the comment; field and the method parameter types. A class with the `ClassDef` macro; has the ability to obtain a **`TClass`** with the `IsA` method. ``` {.cpp}; TClass *cl = obj->IsA();; ```. It returns a **`TClass`**. In addition, an object can directly get the; class name and the base classes by:. ``` {.cpp}; const char* name = obj->ClassName();; ```. If the class is a descendent of **`TObject`**, you can check if an; object inherits from a specific class, you can use the `InheritsFrom`; method. This method returns `kTrue` if the object inherits from the; specified class name or **`TClass`**. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(""TLine"");; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(TLine::Class());; ```. ROOT and `Cling` rely on reflection and the class dictionary to identify; the type of a variable at run time. With **`TObject`** inheritance come; some methods that use Introspection to help you see the data in the; object or class. For instance:. ``` {.cpp}; obj->Dump(); // lists all data members and their current values; obj->Inspect(); // opens a window to browse data members; obj->DrawClass(); // Draws the class inheritance tree; ```. For an example of `obj->Inspect()`, see ""Inspecting Objects"". ### Collections. To store an object in a ROOT collection, it must be a descendent of; **`TObject`**. This is convenient if you want to store objects of; different classes in the same collection and execute the method o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md:1180,inherit,inherits,1180,documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,1,['inherit'],['inherits']

The combined use of COMDATS and section attributes may yield surprising results.; For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. $foo = comdat any; $bar = comdat any; @g1 = global i32 42, section ""sec"", comdat($foo); @g2 = global i32 42, section ""sec"", comdat($bar). From the object file perspective, this requires the creation of two sections; with the same name. This is necessary because both globals belong to different; COMDAT groups and COMDATs, at the object file level, are represented by; sections. Note that certain IR constructs like global variables and functions may; create COMDATs in the object file in addition to any which are specified using; COMDAT IR. This arises when the code generator is configured to emit globals; in individual sections (e.g. when `-data-sections` or `-function-sections`; is supplied to `llc`). .. _namedmetadatastructure:.

If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:. Global Variables; ----------------. Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time; instead of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`. Either global variable definitions or declarations may have an explicit section; to be placed in and may have an optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable.

If the; target supports it, it will emit globals to the section specified.; Additionally, the global can placed in a comdat if the target has the necessary; support. External declarations may have an explicit section specified. Section; information is retained in LLVM IR for targets that make use of this; information. Attaching section information to an external declaration is an; assertion that its definition is located in the specified section. If the; definition is located in a different section, the behavior is undefined. LLVM allows an explicit code model to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals in the code model specified,; overriding the code model used to compile the translation unit.; The allowed values are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model. By default, global initializers are optimized by assuming that global; variables defined within the module are not modified from their; initial values before the start of the global initializer. This is; true even for variables potentially accessible from outside the; module, including those with external linkage or appearing in; ``@llvm.used`` or dllexported variables. This assumption may be suppressed; by marking the variable with ``externally_initialized``. An explicit alignment may be specified for a global, which must be a; power of 2. If not present, or if the alignment is set to zero, the; alignment of the global is set by the target to whatever it feels; convenient.

For example if you would like to run a script `myMacro.C` in the; background, redirect the output into a file `myMacro.log`, and exit; after the script execution, use the following syntax:. ```; root -b -q myMacro.C > myMacro.log; ```. If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; ```. Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a; parameter, the syntax is:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; ```. You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared; library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled; speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". ```; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ```. ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available; ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By; typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call; functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; ```.

Every object in the; canvas is a graphical object in the sense that you can grab it, resize; it, and change some characteristics using the mouse. The canvas area; can be divided in several sub areas, so-called pads; (the class **`TPad`**). A pad is a canvas sub area that can contain; other pads or graphical objects.

On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a likelihood builder `buildLikelihood`, as a free function in the namespace.; This function analyzes the `pdf` and automatically constructs the proper likelihood, built; up from the available `RooAbsL` subclasses. The new classes are not per se meant to be used outside of `RooMinimizer`, although they can be.; The main reason is that they do not behave as regular `RooAbsReal` objects, but have their own interface which was kept to the minimum necessary for interacting with `RooMinimizer` as an object that encodes purely the statistics concepts.; However, we do provide the `RooRealL` class, which holds a `RooAbsL` object, but does inherit from `RooAbsReal` as well, so that it can be used in contexts where you would normally use a `RooAbsReal` (like for plotting). ### Usage example: Create an unbinned likelihood object; It is possible to directly create `RooAbsL` based likelihood objects from a pdf and dataset, in this example a `RooUnbinnedL` type:; ``` {.cpp}; RooAbsPdf *pdf;; RooDataSet *data;; std::tie(pdf, data) = generate_some_unbinned_pdf_and_dataset(with, some, parameters);.

DataFlowSanitizer comes with a; default ABI list which is intended to eventually cover the glibc library on; Linux but it may become necessary for users to extend the ABI list in cases; where a particular library or function cannot be instrumented (e.g. because; it is implemented in assembly or another language which DataFlowSanitizer does; not support) or a function is called from a library or function which cannot; be instrumented. DataFlowSanitizer's ABI list file is a :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`.; The pass treats every function in the ``uninstrumented`` category in the; ABI list file as conforming to the native ABI. Unless the ABI list contains; additional categories for those functions, a call to one of those functions; will produce a warning message, as the labelling behavior of the function; is unknown. The other supported categories are ``discard``, ``functional``; and ``custom``. * ``discard`` -- To the extent that this function writes to (user-accessible); memory, it also updates labels in shadow memory (this condition is trivially; satisfied for functions which do not write to user-accessible ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.rst:2345,extend,extend,2345,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']

Then we add a; branch for each of the variables to the tree, by calling the; `TTree::Branch` method for each variable. ``` {.cpp}; void tree1w(){. // create a tree file tree1.root - create the file, the Tree and; // a few branches; TFile f(""tree1.root"",""recreate"");; TTree t1(""t1"",""a simple Tree with simple variables"");; Float_t px, py, pz;; Double_t random;; Int_t ev;; t1.Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; t1.Branch(""py"",&py,""py/F"");; t1.Branch(""pz"",&pz,""pz/F"");; t1.Branch(""ev"",&ev,""ev/I"");. // fill the tree; for (Int_t i=0; i<10000; i++) {; gRandom->Rannor(px,py);; pz = px*px + py*py;; random = gRandom->Rndm();; ev = i;; t1.Fill();; }; // save the Tree heade; the file will be automatically closed; // when going out of the function scope; t1.Write();; }; ```. #### Creating Branches with A single Variable. This is the signature of `TTree::Branch` to create a branch with a list; of variables:. ``` {.cpp}; TBranch* TTree::Branch(const char* name,void* address,; const char* leaflist,; Int_t bufsize = 32000); ```. The first parameter is the branch name. The second parameter is the; address from which to read the value. The third parameter is the leaf; list with the name and type of each leaf. In this example, each branch; has only one leaf. In the box below, the branch is named `px` and has; one floating point type leaf also called `px`. ``` {.cpp}; t1.Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; ```. #### Filling the Tree. First we find some random values for the variables. We assign `px` and; `py` a Gaussian with mean = 0 and sigma = 1 by calling; `gRandom->Rannor(px,py)`, and calculate` pz`. Then we call the; `TTree::Fill()` method. The call `t1.Fill()` fills all branches in the; tree because we have already organized the tree into branches and told; each branch where to get the value from.

A horizontal splitter resizes the frames above and; below of it; a vertical splitter resizes the frames left and right of; it. ![](pictures/02000220.jpg). This widget is represented by **`TGSplitter`**, **`TGHSplitter`**, and; **`TGVSplitter`** classes. Currently there is no special graphics; representation for splitter widgets; only the cursor changes when; crossing a splitter. There is nothing special to create a splitter - two lines of code only:. ``` {.cpp}; TGHSplitter *hsplitter = new TGHSplitter(fVf);; hsplitter->SetFrame(fH1,kTRUE);; ```. You call a horizontal **`TGHSplitter`** or a vertical **`TGVSplitter`**; splitter constructor and after you set the frame to be resized via; `SetFrame` method. In spite of that, there are rules to be followed when; you create a splitter in your application. For a `horizontal` splitter they are:. - the parent of a horizontal splitter must inherit from; **`TGCompoziteFrame`** and must have a vertical layout. - the `above` resized frame must have `kFixedHeight` option set. - use layout hints `kLHintsTop | kLHintsExpandX` when adding the; **`above`** resized frame to its parent. - use layout hints `kLHintsBottom | kLHintsExpandX | kLHintsExpandY`; when adding the bottom resized frame to its parent. - set the **`above`** frame to be resized using `SetFrame` method; the; second parameter should be `kTRUE`. You can see these rules in the code below:. ``` {.cpp}; // Create horizontal splitter; fVf = new TGVerticalFrame(fMain,10,10);; fH1 = new TGHorizontalFrame(fVf,10,10, kFixedHeight);; fH2 = new TGHorizontalFrame(fVf,10,10);; fFtop = new TGCompositeFrame(fH1,10,10, kSunkenFrame);; fFbottom = new TGCompositeFrame(fH2,10,10,kSunkenFrame);; fLtop = new TGLabel(fFtop,""Top Frame"");; fLbottom = new TGLabel(fFbottom,""Bottom Frame"");. fFtop->AddFrame(fLtop, new TGLayoutHints(kLHintsLeft |; kLHintsCenterY,3,0,0,0));; fFbottom->AddFrame(fLbottom, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md:94366,inherit,inherit,94366,documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,1,['inherit'],['inherit']

ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. . Not all tools support this format. For example, lld and the gold plugin will; ignore the ``.llvmbc`` section when linking object files, but can use; ``.llvm.lto`` sections when passed the correct command line options. .. _encoding of LLVM IR:. LLVM IR Encoding; ================. LLVM IR is encoded into a bitstream by defining blocks and records. It uses; blocks for things like constant pools, functions, symbol tables, etc. It uses; records for things like instructions, global variable descriptors, type; descriptions, etc. This document does not describe the set of abbreviations; that the writer uses, as these are fully self-described in the file, and the; reader is not allowed to build in any knowledge of this.

Signed VBRs; ^^^^^^^^^^^. `Variable Width Integer`_ encoding is an efficient way to encode arbitrary sized; unsigned values, but is an extremely inefficient for encoding signed values, as; signed values are otherwise treated as maximally large unsigned values.

You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its; value. You can also undefine a variable:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/llvm/source.

The structure is initialized such that:. a. The ``forwarding`` pointer is set to the beginning of its enclosing; structure. b. The ``size`` field is initialized to the total size of the enclosing; structure. c. The ``flags`` field is set to either 0 if no helper functions are needed; or (1<<25) if they are. d. The helper functions are initialized (if present). e. The variable itself is set to its initial value. f. The ``isa`` field is set to ``NULL``. Access to ``__block`` variables from within its lexical scope; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In order to ""move"" the variable to the heap upon a ``copy_helper`` operation the; compiler must rewrite access to such a variable to be indirect through the; structures ``forwarding`` pointer.

In the case of a ``Block`` reference variable being marked ``__block`` the; helper code generated must use the ``_Block_object_assign`` and; ``_Block_object_dispose`` routines supplied by the runtime to make the; copies.

Limitations:. - we cannot efficiently detect that a S3 server is able to respond to; multi-range HTTP GET requests. Some servers, such as Amazon's,; respond to such kind of requests with the whole file contents. Other; servers, such as Huawei's, respond with the exact partial content; requested. Therefore, I added the possibility of configuring the; behavior via the ROOT configuration file: the identity of the; servers known to correctly support multi-range requests is; configurable. If the server is known to support this feature, ROOT; will send multi-range requests, otherwise it will issue multiple; single-range GET requests, which is also the default behavior.; - currently the virtual host syntax:; ""s3://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/my/file"" is not supported; but can be added if this is considered useful. The TAS3File class will be removed and should not have been used; directly by users anyway as it was only accessed via the plugin manager; in TFile::Open(). ### New HTTP Server package. A new HTTP Server package has been introduced. The idea behind such server is to provide direct access to the data from a running ROOT application. Any object can be streamed when requested and delivered to the browser. ##### Starting HTTP server. To start http server, at any time create instance; of the **`THttpServer`** class like:. ``` {.cpp}; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; ```. This will start civetweb-based http server on port 8080.; Then, one should be able to open address ""http://localhost:8080""; in any modern browser and browse objects created in application. By default, the server can access files, canvases and histograms via gROOT. All such objects can be displayed with JSRootIO graphics. At any time one could register other objects with the command:. ``` {.cpp}; TGraph* gr = new TGraph(10);; gr->SetName(""gr1"");; serv->Register(""graphs/subfolder"", gr);; ```.

From this file, :program:`tblgen` generates the unique ID of the; diagnostic, the severity of the diagnostic and the English translation + format; string. There is little sanity with the naming of the unique ID's right now. Some; start with ``err_``, ``warn_``, ``ext_`` to encode the severity into the name.; Since the enum is referenced in the C++ code that produces the diagnostic, it; is somewhat useful for it to be reasonably short. The severity of the diagnostic comes from the set {``NOTE``, ``REMARK``,; ``WARNING``,; ``EXTENSION``, ``EXTWARN``, ``ERROR``}. The ``ERROR`` severity is used for; diagnostics indicating the program is never acceptable under any circumstances.; When an error is emitted, the AST for the input code may not be fully built.; The ``EXTENSION`` and ``EXTWARN`` severities are used for extensions to the; language that Clang accepts. This means that Clang fully understands and can; represent them in the AST, but we produce diagnostics to tell the user their; code is non-portable. The difference is that the former are ignored by; default, and the later warn by default. The ``WARNING`` severity is used for; constructs that are valid in the currently selected source language but that; are dubious in some way. The ``REMARK`` severity provides generic information; about the compilation that is not necessarily related to any dubious code. The; ``NOTE`` level is used to staple more information onto previous diagnostics. These *severities* are mapped into a smaller set (the ``Diagnostic::Level``; enum, {``Ignored``, ``Note``, ``Remark``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``}) of; output; *levels* by the diagnostics subsystem based on various configuration options.; Clang internally supports a fully fine grained mapping mechanism that allows; you to map almost any diagnostic to the output level that you want.

We introduced an optimized infrastructure for reading objects using a StreamerInfo.

When deciding between creating a type hierarchy (with either tagged or virtual; dispatch) and using templates or concepts-based polymorphism, consider whether; there is some refinement of an abstract base class which is a semantically; meaningful type on an interface boundary. If anything more refined than the; root abstract interface is meaningless to talk about as a partial extension of; the semantic model, then your use case likely fits better with polymorphism and; you should avoid using virtual dispatch. However, there may be some exigent; circumstances that require one technique or the other to be used. If you do need to introduce a type hierarchy, we prefer to use explicitly; closed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code. We have also found that a large; amount of our usage of type hierarchies fits better with tag-based pattern; matching rather than dynamic dispatch across a common interface.

Modifiability,"s; ---------------------. Most of the debugging information in a MIR file is to be found in the metadata; of the embedded module. Within a machine function, that metadata is referred to; by various constructs to describe source locations and variable locations. Source locations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every MIR instruction may optionally have a trailing reference to a; ``DILocation`` metadata node, after all operands and symbols, but before; memory operands:. .. code-block:: text. $rbp = MOV64rr $rdi, debug-location !12. The source location attachment is synonymous with the ``!dbg`` metadata; attachment in LLVM-IR. The absence of a source location attachment will be; represented by an empty ``DebugLoc`` object in the machine instruction. Fixed variable locations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are several ways of specifying variable locations. The simplest is; describing a variable that is permanently located on the stack. In the stack; or fixedStack attribute of the machine function, the variable, scope, and; any qualifying location modifier are provided:. .. code-block:: text. - { id: 0, name: offset.addr, offset: -24, size: 8, alignment: 8, stack-id: default,; 4 debug-info-variable: '!1', debug-info-expression: '!DIExpression()',; debug-info-location: '!2' }. Where:. - ``debug-info-variable`` identifies a DILocalVariable metadata node,. - ``debug-info-expression`` adds qualifiers to the variable location,. - ``debug-info-location`` identifies a DILocation metadata node. These metadata attributes correspond to the operands of a ``llvm.dbg.declare``; IR intrinsic, see the :ref:`source level debugging<format_common_intrinsics>`; documentation.

Modifiability,"s; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken. Leave it on the staging buildmaster; While most of this section has been biased towards builders intended for; the main buildmaster, it is worth highlighting that builders can run; indefinitely on the staging buildmaster. Such a builder may still be; useful for the sponsoring organization, without concern of negatively; impacting the broader community. The sponsoring organization simply; has to take on the responsibility of all bisection and triage. ; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:12431,config,configure,12431,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,1,['config'],['configure']

Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a; ``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``,; and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum),; so this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need. See `Concrete; Bases and Deeper Hierarchies`_ for more information about how to extend; this example to more general hierarchies. Although for this small example setting up LLVM-style RTTI seems like a lot; of ""boilerplate"", if your classes are doing anything interesting then this; will end up being a tiny fraction of the code. Concrete Bases and Deeper Hierarchies; =====================================. For concrete bases (i.e. non-abstract interior nodes of the inheritance; tree), the ``Kind`` check inside ``classof`` needs to be a bit more; complicated. The situation differs from the example above in that. * Since the class is concrete, it must itself have an entry in the ``Kind``; enum because it is possible to have objects with this class as a dynamic; type. * Since the class has children, the check inside ``classof`` must take them; into account. Say that ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` derive; from ``Square``, and so ``ShapeKind`` becomes:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; + SK_SpecialSquare,; + SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; SK_Circle; }. Then in ``Square``, we would need to modify the ``classof`` like so:. .. code-block:: c++. - static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; - return S->getKind() == SK_Square;; - }; + static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; + return S->getKind() >= SK_Square &&; + S->getKind() <= SK_OtherSpecialSquare;; + }.

The ``llvm.ptrmask`` intrinsic masks out bits of the pointer according to a mask.; This allows stripping data from tagged pointers without converting them to an; integer (ptrtoint/inttoptr). As a consequence, we can preserve more information; to facilitate alias analysis and underlying-object detection. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The result of ``ptrmask(%ptr, %mask)`` is equivalent to the following expansion,; where ``iPtrIdx`` is the index type size of the pointer::. %intptr = ptrtoint ptr %ptr to iPtrIdx ; this may truncate; %masked = and iPtrIdx %intptr, %mask; %diff = sub iPtrIdx %masked, %intptr; %result = getelementptr i8, ptr %ptr, iPtrIdx %diff. If the pointer index type size is smaller than the pointer type size, this; implies that pointer bits beyond the index size are not affected by this; intrinsic. For integral pointers, it behaves as if the mask were extended with; 1 bits to the pointer type size. Both the returned pointer(s) and the first argument are based on the same; underlying object (for more information on the *based on* terminology see; :ref:`the pointer aliasing rules <pointeraliasing>`).

Modifiability,"s; talk about the output of the parser: the Abstract Syntax Tree. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST); ==============================. The AST for a program captures its behavior in such a way that it is; easy for later stages of the compiler (e.g. code generation) to; interpret. We basically want one object for each construct in the; language, and the AST should closely model the language. In; Kaleidoscope, we have expressions, a prototype, and a function object.; We'll start with expressions first:. .. code-block:: c++. /// ExprAST - Base class for all expression nodes.; class ExprAST {; public:; virtual ~ExprAST() = default;; };. /// NumberExprAST - Expression class for numeric literals like ""1.0"".; class NumberExprAST : public ExprAST {; double Val;. public:; NumberExprAST(double Val) : Val(Val) {}; };. The code above shows the definition of the base ExprAST class and one; subclass which we use for numeric literals. The important thing to note; about this code is that the NumberExprAST class captures the numeric; value of the literal as an instance variable. This allows later phases; of the compiler to know what the stored numeric value is. Right now we only create the AST, so there are no useful accessor; methods on them. It would be very easy to add a virtual method to pretty; print the code, for example. Here are the other expression AST node; definitions that we'll use in the basic form of the Kaleidoscope; language:. .. code-block:: c++. /// VariableExprAST - Expression class for referencing a variable, like ""a"".; class VariableExprAST : public ExprAST {; std::string Name;. public:; VariableExprAST(const std::string &Name) : Name(Name) {}; };. /// BinaryExprAST - Expression class for a binary operator.; class BinaryExprAST : public ExprAST {; char Op;; std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> LHS, RHS;. public:; BinaryExprAST(char Op, std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> LHS,; std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> RHS); : Op(Op), LHS(std::move(LHS)), RHS(std::move(RHS)) {}; };. /// CallExprAST - Express",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:2054,variab,variable,2054,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Specifically, pointers in return and argument types are treated as equivalent as; long as the qualifiers for the type they point to match. For example, ``char*``,; ``char**``, and ``int*`` are considered equivalent types.

It is recommended that the `SavePrimitive` is; implemented in user defined classes if it is to be drawn on a canvas.; Such that the command `TCanvas::SaveAs(Canvas.C)` will preserve the; user-class object in the resulting script. ### GetObjectInfo. This method is called when displaying the event status in a canvas. To; show the event status window, select the `Options` menu and the; `EventStatus` item. This method returns a string of information about; the object at position (x, y). Every time the cursor moves, the object; under the cursor executes the `GetObjectInfo` method. The string is then; shown in the status bar. There is a default implementation in; **`TObject`**, but it is typically overridden for classes that can; report peculiarities for different cursor positions (for example the bin; contents in a TH1). ### IsFolder. By default an object inheriting from **`TObject`** is not brows-able,; because **`TObject::IsFolder()`** returns `kFALSE`. To make a class; browse-able, the `IsFolder` method needs to be overridden to return; `kTRUE`. In general, this method returns `kTRUE` if the object contains; browse-able objects (like containers or lists of other objects). ### Bit Masks and Unique ID.

Options; -------. GWP-ASan's configuration is managed by the supporting allocator. We provide a; generic configuration management library that is used by Scudo. It allows; several aspects of GWP-ASan to be configured through the following methods:. - When the GWP-ASan library is compiled, by setting; ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`` to the options string you want set by default.; If you're building GWP-ASan as part of a compiler-rt/LLVM build, add it during; cmake configure time (e.g. ``cmake ... -DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""``). If; you're building GWP-ASan outside of compiler-rt, simply ensure that you; specify ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""`` when building; ``optional/options_parser.cpp``). - By defining a ``__gwp_asan_default_options`` function in one's program that; returns the options string to be parsed. Said function must have the following; prototype: ``extern ""C"" const char* __gwp_asan_default_options(void)``, with a; default visibility.

Modifiability,"se errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed.

This example is a simplified version of `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx`; and where Event objects are saved in a tree. The full definition of; `Event` is in `$ROOTSYS/test`/`Event.h`. To execute this macro, you will; need the library `$ROOTSYS/test/libEvent.so`. If it does not exist you; can build the test directory applications by following the instruction; in the `$ROOTSYS/test/README` file. In this example we will show. - the difference in splitting or not splitting a branch; - how to read selected branches of the tree,; - how to print a selected entry. ### The Event Class. `Event` is a descendent of **`TObject`**. As such it inherits the data; members of **`TObject`** and its methods such as `Dump()` and; `Inspect() `and` Write()`. In addition, because it inherits from; **`TObject`** it can be a member of a collection. To summarize, the; advantages of inheriting from a **`TObject`** are:. - Inherit the `Write`, `Inspect`, and `Dump` methods; - Enables a class to be a member of a ROOT collection; - Enables RTTI. Below is the list of the `Event` data members. It contains a character; array, several integers, a floating-point number, and an `EventHeader`; object. The `EventHeader` class is described in the following paragraph.; `Event` also has two pointers, one to a **`TClonesArray`** of tracks and; one to a histogram. The string ""`->`"" in the comment field of the; members `*fTracks` and `*fH` instructs the automatic `Streamer` to; assume that the objects `*fTracks` and `*fH` are never null pointers and; that `fTracks->Streamer` can be used instead of the more time consuming; form `R__b << fTracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; Event",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:58763,inherit,inherits,58763,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['inherit'],['inherits']
Modifiability,"se {; cout << ""There are no roots"" << endl;; }; }; }; ```. Let us first look how we create an object. When we create an object; by:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. We are creating an object on the stack. A FORTRAN programmer may be; familiar with the idea; it is not unlike a local variable in a; function or subroutine. Although there are still a few old timers who; do not know it, FORTRAN is under no obligation to save local variables; once the function or subroutine returns unless the SAVE statement is; used. If not then it is likely that FORTRAN will place them on the; stack and they will ""pop off"" when the RETURN statement is reached. To; give an object more permanence it has to be placed on the heap. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. The second line declares a pointer to `Quad` called `my_objptr`. From; the syntax point of view, this is just like all the other declarations; we have seen so far, i.e. this is a stack variable. The value of the; pointer is set equal to. ``` {.cpp}; new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. `new`, despite its looks, is an operator and creates an object or; variable of the type that comes next, `Quad` in this case, on the; heap. Just as with stack objects it has to be initialized by calling; its constructor. The syntax requires that the argument list follows the; type. This one statement has brought two items into existence, one on; the heap and one on the stack. The heap object will live until the; delete operator is applied to it. There is no FORTRAN parallel to a heap object; variables either come; or go as control passes in and out of a function or subroutine, or,; like a COMMON block variables, live for the lifetime of the program.; However, most people in HEP who use FORTRAN will have experience of a; memory manager and the act of creating a bank is a good equivalent of; a heap object.

Finally we want to allow implicit modules for configurations that were not prebuilt. When using the clang driver a module cache path is implicitly selected. Using ``-cc1``, we simply add use the ``-fmodules-cache-path`` option. .. code-block:: sh. clang -cc1 -emit-obj -o use.o use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fprebuilt-module-path=prebuilt -fprebuilt-implicit-modules -fmodules-cache-path=cache; clang -cc1 -emit-obj -o use.o use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fprebuilt-module-path=prebuilt -fprebuilt-implicit-modules -fmodules-cache-path=cache -DENABLE_A; clang -cc1 -emit-obj -o use.o use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fprebuilt-module-path=prebuilt -fprebuilt-implicit-modules -fmodules-cache-path=cache -DENABLE_A -DOTHER_OPTIONS. This way, a single directory containing multiple variants of modules can be prepared and reused. The options configuring the module cache are independent of other options. Module Semantics; ================. Modules are modeled as if each submodule were a separate translation unit, and a module import makes names from the other translation unit visible. Each submodule starts with a new preprocessor state and an empty translation unit. .. note::. This behavior is currently only approximated when building a module with submodules. Entities within a submodule that has already been built are visible when building later submodules in that module. This can lead to fragile modules that depend on the build order used for the submodules of the module, and should not be relied upon. This behavior is subject to change. As an example, in C, this implies that if two structs are defined in different submodules with the same name, those two types are distinct types (but may be *compatible* types if their definitions match). In C++, two structs defined with the same name in different submodules are the *same* type, and must be equiv",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:24018,config,configuring,24018,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['config'],['configuring']

Greater compression can be achieved when similar data is consecutive.; 2. The object's data members can easily be split into different TTree branches; (TTrees are discussed below). ### TTree. A TTree is a highly specialized container class for efficient storage and retrieval of user data.; The use of TTrees is discussed in detail in the; [Trees chapter of the Root Manual](https://root.cern/manual/trees/). Here we discuss in particular how a TTree is stored in a ROOTIO file. A TTree object is split into one or more branches (class TBranch), each of which may have its own; (sub)branches, recursively to any depth. Each TBranch contains an array of zero or more leaves; (class TLeaf), each corresponding to a basic variable type or a class object that has not been split.; The TLeaf object does not actually contain variable values, only information about the variables.; The actual data on each branch is physically stored in basket objects (class TBasket). The user; can set the basket size on a per TBranch basis. The default basket size is 32000 bytes.; This should be viewed as an approximate number. There is one TTree data record per file for each tree in the file, corresponding to a TTree; class object. The TTree class object recursively contains TBranch objects, each of which; contains an array of TBasket objects to hold its data. However, the TTree data record does not necessarily contain the entire TTree object. For each; branch, exactly one TBasket object is contained in the TTree data record. If the data on a; given branch fits in one basket, then all the data for that branch will be in the TTree record; itself. Otherwise, there will be a separate TBasket data record for each additional basket used on; the branch, each containing a TBasket object containing user data.

When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different. Architects and many compiler people care much more about; > the second question. The Java compiler and OS community care much more; > about the first one. 3. By focusing on a more low level virtual machine, we have much more room; for value add. The nice safe ""sandbox"" VM can be provided as a layer; on top of it.

Currently, ``-analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate`` is the default mode. While ``-analyzer-config ipa`` determines in general how aggressively the analyzer; will try to inline functions, several additional options control which types of; functions can inlined, in an all-or-nothing way. These options use the; analyzer's configuration table, so they are all specified as follows:. ``-analyzer-config OPTION=VALUE``. c++-inlining; ------------. This option controls which C++ member functions may be inlined. ``-analyzer-config c++-inlining=[none | methods | constructors | destructors]``. Each of these modes implies that all the previous member function kinds will be; inlined as well; it doesn't make sense to inline destructors without inlining; constructors, for example. The default c++-inlining mode is 'destructors', meaning that all member; functions with visible definitions will be considered for inlining.

Example on how to create a class that represents a mathematical function. The user only has to override two methods from `IBaseFunctionOneDim`:. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim; {; double DoEval(double x) const; {; return x*x;; }. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim* Clone() const; {; return new MyFunction();; }; };; ```. * `ROOT::Math::IGradientFunctionOneDim`: Some of the numerical algorithm will need to calculate the derivatives of the function. In these cases, the user will have to provide the necessary code for; this to happen. The interface defined in `IGradientFunctionOneDim` introduced the method `double Derivative(double x)` that will return the derivative of the function at the point `x`. The class; inherit by the user will have to implement the abstract method `double DoDerivative(double x)`, leaving the rest of the class untouched.

Learning C++ . ; One use case of cling is to aid the C++ learning process. Offering imediate feedback the user can easily get familiar with the structures and spelling of the language. ; . Creating scripts; ; The power of an interpreter lays as well in the compactness and ease of repeatedly running a small snippet of code - aka a script.

Runtime-Generated Code ; ; Sometime it's convenient to create code as a reaction to input; (user/network/configuration).; Runtime-generated code can interface with C++ libraries.; . Embedding Cling . The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

Modifiability,"ses with hidden LTO; visibility. A class's LTO visibility is treated as an ODR-relevant property; of its definition, so it must be consistent between translation units. In translation units built with LTO, LTO visibility is based on the; class's symbol visibility as expressed at the source level (i.e. the; ``__attribute__((visibility(""..."")))`` attribute, or the ``-fvisibility=``; flag) or, on the Windows platform, the dllimport and dllexport attributes. When; targeting non-Windows platforms, classes with a visibility other than hidden; visibility receive public LTO visibility. When targeting Windows, classes; with dllimport or dllexport attributes receive public LTO visibility. All; other classes receive hidden LTO visibility. Classes with internal linkage; (e.g. classes declared in unnamed namespaces) also receive hidden LTO; visibility. During the LTO link, all classes with public LTO visibility but not marked with; ``[[clang::lto_visibility_public]]`` (see below) will be refined to hidden LTO; visibility when the ``--lto-whole-program-visibility`` lld linker option is; applied (``-plugin-opt=whole-program-visibility`` for gold). This flag can be; used to defer specifying whether classes have hidden LTO visibility until link; time, to allow bitcode objects to be shared by different LTO links. Due to an; implementation limitation, symbols associated with classes with hidden LTO; visibility may still be exported from the binary when using this flag. It is; unsafe to refer to these symbols, and their visibility may be relaxed to hidden; in a future compiler release. A class defined in a translation unit built without LTO receives public; LTO visibility regardless of its object file visibility, linkage or other; attributes. This mechanism will produce the correct result in most cases, but there are; two cases where it may wrongly infer hidden LTO visibility. 1.

You may get a; runtime assertion failure if you attempt to get an analysis that you did not; declare as required in your :ref:`getAnalysisUsage; <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysisUsage>` implementation. This method can be; called by your ``run*`` method implementation, or by any other local method; invoked by your ``run*`` method.

Modifiability,"sible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime. There are also uncommon enough to make it; reasonable to require the precise-lifetime annotation if someone; really wants to rely on them. Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the chance to operate on the value, e.g. to retain it, before; ARC releases the original pointer. Note again, however, that; dependence does not survive a store, so ARC does not guarantee the; continued validity of the return value past the end of the; full-expression. .. _arc.optimization.object_lifetime:.

Modifiability,"signID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression). This intrinsic marks the position in IR where a source assignment occurred. It; encodes the value of the variable. It references the store, if any, that; performs the assignment, and the destination address. The first three arguments are the same as for an ``llvm.dbg.value``. The fourth; argument is a ``DIAssignID`` used to reference a store. The fifth is the; destination of the store (wrapped as metadata), and the sixth is a `complex; expression <LangRef.html#diexpression>`_ that modifies it. The formal LLVM-IR signature is:. .. code-block:: llvm. void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata). See :doc:`AssignmentTracking` for more info. Object lifetimes and scoping; ============================. In many languages, the local variables in functions can have their lifetimes or; scopes limited to a subset of a function. In the C family of languages, for; example, variables are only live (readable and writable) within the source; block that they are defined in. In functional languages, values are only; readable after they have been defined. Though this is a very obvious concept,; it is non-trivial to model in LLVM, because it has no notion of scoping in this; sense, and does not want to be tied to a language's scoping rules. In order to handle this, the LLVM debug format uses the metadata attached to; llvm instructions to encode line number and scoping information. Consider the; following C fragment, for example:. .. code-block:: c. 1. void foo() {; 2. int X = 21;; 3. int Y = 22;; 4. {; 5. int Z = 23;; 6. Z = X;; 7. }; 8. X = Y;; 9. }. Compiled to LLVM, this function would be represented like this:. .. code-block:: text. ; Function Attrs: nounwind ssp uwtable; define void @foo() #0 !dbg !4 {; entry:; %X = alloca i32, align 4; %Y = alloca i32, align 4; %Z = alloca i32, align 4; call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata i32* %X, metadata !11, metadata !13), !dbg !14; store i32 2",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:12072,variab,variables,12072,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

The **`TSytem::IgnoreInterrupt()`** is a method; to toggle the handling of the interrupt signal. Typically it is called; to prevent a `SIGINT` to interrupt some important call (like writing to; a ROOT file). If **`TRint`** is used and the default ROOT interrupt handler is not; desired, you should use `GetSignalHandler()` of **`TApplication`** to; get the interrupt handler and to remove it by `RemoveSignalHandler()`of; **`TSystem`** . ## Glossary. The following glossary is adapted from the description of the Rogue Wave; `Threads.h`++ package. A **`process`** is a program that is loaded into memory and prepared for; execution. Each process has a private address space. Processes begin; with a single thread. A **`thread`** is a sequence of instructions being executed in a; program. A thread has a program counter and a private stack to keep; track of local variables and return addresses. A multithreaded process; is associated with one or more threads. Threads execute independently.; All threads in a given process share the private address space of that; process. **`Concurrency`** exists when at least two threads are in progress at; the same time. A system with only a single processor can support; concurrency by switching execution contexts among multiple threads. **`Parallelism`** arises when at least two threads are executing; simultaneously. This requires a system with multiple processors.; Parallelism implies concurrency, but not vice-versa. A function is **`reentrant`** if it will behave correctly even if a; thread of execution enters the function while one or more threads are; already executing within the function. These could be the same thread,; in the case of recursion, or different threads, in the case of; concurrency. **`Thread-specific data`** (**`TSD`**) is also known as thread-local; storage (TLS).

The substitution's current position in the substitution; list does not change so that expansion order relative to other existing; substitutions is preserved. The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons. This syntax has a few advantages:. - It is impossible for ``%{name}`` to contain sequences that are special in; python's ``re.sub`` patterns. Otherwise, attempting to specify; ``%{name}`` as a substitution pattern in a lit configuration file could; produce confusing expansions.; - The braces help avoid the possibility that another substitution's pattern; will match part of ``%{name}`` or vice-versa, producing confusing; expansions. However, the patterns of substitutions defined by lit; configuration files and by lit itself are not restricted to this form, so; overlaps are still theoretically possible. - **Substitution value**: The value includes all text from the first; non-whitespace character after ``=`` to the last non-whitespace character. If; there is no non-whitespace character after ``=``, the value is the empty; string. Escape sequences that can appear in python ``re.sub`` replacement; strings are treated as plain text in the value.; - **Line continuations**: If the last non-whitespace character on the line after; ``:`` is ``\``, then the next directive must use the same directive keyword; (e.g., ``DEFINE:``) , and it is an error if there is no additional directive.; That directive s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:34213,config,configuration,34213,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If you; have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic up on; the llvm-dev list. At the very worst, you can always treat LLVM as if it; were a ""dumb code generator"" and implement the high-level optimizations; you desire in your front-end, on the language-specific AST. Tips and Tricks; ===============. There is a variety of useful tips and tricks that you come to know after; working on/with LLVM that aren't obvious at first glance. Instead of; letting everyone rediscover them, this section talks about some of these; issues. Implementing portable offsetof/sizeof; -------------------------------------. One interesting thing that comes up, if you are trying to keep the code; generated by your compiler ""target independent"", is that you often need; to know the size of some LLVM type or the offset of some field in an; llvm structure. For example, you might need to pass the size of a type; into a function that allocates memory. Unfortunately, this can vary widely across targets: for example the; width of a pointer is trivially target-specific. However, there is a; `clever way to use the getelementptr; instruction <http://nondot.org/sabre/LLVMNotes/SizeOf-OffsetOf-VariableSizedStructs.txt>`_; that allows you to compute this in a portable way. Garbage Collected Stack Frames; ------------------------------. Some languages want to explicitly manage their stack frames, often so; that they are garbage collected or to allow easy implementation of; closures. There are often better ways to implement these features than; explicit stack frames, but `LLVM does support; them, <http://nondot.org/sabre/LLVMNotes/ExplicitlyManagedStackFrames.txt>`_; if you want. It requires your front-end to convert the code into; `Continuation Passing; Style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style>`_ and; the use of tail calls (which LLVM also supports).
