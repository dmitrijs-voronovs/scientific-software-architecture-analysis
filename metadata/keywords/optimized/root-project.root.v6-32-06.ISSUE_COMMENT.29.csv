Modifiability,"> @bernhardmgruber @jalopezg-git is there a way for us to fix `TString`'s traditional comparison ops, to avoid having to define an `op<=>`?. Yes, but I have far to little context to understand what you are trying to solve here. I assume something broke when you switched to C++20. C++20 (leaving `operator<=>` on the side for now) introduced comparison rewrite rules which may be a potential cause. E.g. an expression `tstring == charptr` can now be rewritten by the compiler to `operator==(charptr, tstring)`. This is further complicated by the presence of non-`explicit` unary constructors, since the compiler can use such constructors to perform conversions in order to be able to rewrite comparisons. Looking at `TString.h`, I see lots of non-explicit constructors, non-explicit conversion operators (to `std::string_view` and `std::string`) in the header file (clang-tidy fills up the file with warnings on these). I strongly suspect that the compiler could somehow rewrite a comparison using any of the conversions and find a better match. I strongly believe adding `operator<=>` does not solve anything but just hides an existing problem. Also this block:; ```c++; #ifndef WIN32; // To avoid ambiguities.; inline Bool_t operator==(const char *s1, const std::string_view &s2) { ... }; inline Bool_t operator==(const std::string_view &s1, const char *s2) { ... }; #endif; ```; fosters my believe that there is already something fishy. I would advice to step through a failing unit test in C++20 mode and observe what overloads and conversions are picked .; I am also scared by e.g. defining `operator==(const TString &s1, const char *s2);` at the beginning of the file and the symmetric `operator==(const char *s1, const TString &s2)` at the end. If there is any call to ` charptr == tstring` anywhere in-between, you would get a conversion in C++17 `TString(charptr) == tstring` and a rewrite in C++20, which could change behavior if there is an inconsistency anywhere. I would advice to refacto",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12525#issuecomment-1479606106:353,rewrite,rewrite,353,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12525#issuecomment-1479606106,3,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

Modifiability,"> @hahnjo hm that's an interesting clue, but then I still don't fully understand why `RooFit::TestStatistics::RooUnbinnedL` would give a different answer, because it also just calls `RooAbsPdf::extendedTerm`, so it should still get the exact same result... Yes, you are absolutely right, I got carried away by finding the first / one of the differences by comparing x86 to mac13arm. Looking some more why `RooUnbinnedL` gives two different results on the same platform, it is actually closely related: in `RooUnbinnedL::evaluatePartition`, the `extendedTerm` is added to the first partition, if `events.begin_fraction == 0`. With one big partition, this is added at the very end, just before returning. For the sub event sections, it is added to the first partition and the other partitions are later added on top. This exhibits different rounding, which is *triggered* by mac13arm using the FMA instructions and having a different `extendedTerm` than x86. One solution to this would be to add the `extendedTerm` to the last partition, that is if `events.end_fraction == 1`. This fixes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` on `mac13arm`, but makes it fail on x86 (didn't investigate why). It also makes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fail (both on `mac13arm` and x86) - this test looks even worse in terms of floating point arithmetic, since it expects summing up two partitions individually and then adding the result being bitwise identical to summing up the whole range at once. From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. > Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. See above; the additional problem is that the (optimizing) compiler will insert FMA operations if it sees fit (and is allowed to do so).

It can be a protected method of `TVirtualPad` and then the `Pop` methods can access it (`TPad::Pop` will be able to access it because it inherits from `TVirtualPad`, `TObject` can easily access the method with an `Internal` helper such as `ROOT::Internal::GraphicsUtils::CallTVirtualPadRemove`).

Modifiability,"> Can you elaborate a bit: what is the purpose of this change or the benefits/changes to the code using views?. Sure, `RNTupleGlobalRange` and `RNTupleClusterRange` before this PR are defined as forward ranges. So they can basically be used in a range-for loop and for STL algorithms, but they will use slower versions in some cases, because of the less capable iterator category. A good example is that `std::distance(globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end())` unnecessarily has linear complexity, although it could easility be constant. This effects us a lot as well for the parallel STL. E.g. spanning a parallel index space:; ```c++; std::for_each(std::execution::par, globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end(), [](NTupleSize_t i) { ... });; ```; This has unnecessary complex setup time, because partitioning the index space has linear complexity due to the iterator category. The support for C++20 ranges is orthogonal to these usuability improvements, but should fall out for free. Allowing the refactored types to be used with ranges is just a cherry-on-top to allow the client using the RNTuple API to combine it with a larger set of the C++ standard library. So this changeset is mainly about broadening the usability of these types.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12140#issuecomment-1410407239:996,refactor,refactored,996,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12140#issuecomment-1410407239,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

Modifiability,"> Could it be related to empty base class optimization, or in this case the lack thereof due to multiple inheritance? But in this case, why is the padding missing for `std::variant<X>`, with `struct X {int i; bool b;};`?. So it turns out this is due to EBCO, or rather its non-happening: The reason is that both `std::variant` and `std::optional` inherit from `__sfinae_ctor_base` and `__sfinae_assign_base` and EBCO is not allowed to optimize two empty types at the same offset. That's why the inner type has to have at least one byte of padding, which increases to 4 bytes offset due to alignment. A simplified example is; ```c++; class Empty {};; class Inner : private Empty {; int i;; };; class Outer1 {; Inner i;; };; class Outer2 : private Empty {; Inner i;; };. static_assert(sizeof(Outer1) == 4);; static_assert(sizeof(Outer2) == 8);; ```; (https://godbolt.org/z/6dGdTK6ha) where `Outer2` mimics the case of `std::variant<std::optional<...>>`. Naturally, `struct X` on the other hand does not inherit from the same empty base classes and doesn't need the padding. The problem for RNTuple code is that this can happen for other STL (value) containers as well; we should probably check `std::pair`, `std::tuple` and maybe also maps (not familiar with the implementation). `std::vector`s should be fine because we only need to locate the pointer. (Edit: after further investigation, it appears that this problem is specific to the combination of `std::variant` and `std::optional` that are the only ones using the `__sfinae_*` base classes). ~(FWIW I will also report this to the libc++ developers; they can't do much about it without breaking the ABI, but at least I want to make them aware of this inefficiency in the implementation.)~ (edit: does a `std::variant<std::optional<...>>` actually make much sense?)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15534#issuecomment-2133063596:105,inherit,inheritance,105,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15534#issuecomment-2133063596,3,['inherit'],"['inherit', 'inheritance']"

Right, maintaining backwards compatibility is probably a necessity for such a change. Maybe one can add a (by default enabled) option to symlink from the old libraries to the new ones?

For the average ROOT user this won't make any difference, and in Debian we can disable the option (I don't expect anyone running ROOT software that is still written with Makefiles instead of CMake using Debian system packages). This could be achieved in CMake by adding a new option to the `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` marco, looking something like:; ```cmake; ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE(ROOTGui; HEADERS; ...; SOURCES; ...; DICTIONARY_OPTIONS; ...; DEPENDENCIES; ...; BACKWARDS_COMPAT; Gui; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10985#issuecomment-1188985620:380,plugin,plugins,380,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10985#issuecomment-1188985620,1,['plugin'],['plugins']

I would bet that `TD` has neither the opaque typedef kept nor the default argument being made explicit (all done by `Utils/AST.cpp` and part of T (if I read correctly)). This would explain both the sudden need to request the default template argument and the error related to `Double32_t`. One solution might be to remove those 2 patches and instead to deal with the suffixes in `Utils/AST.cpp`.

[[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3.

On the other hand, the `_batchEvaluations` flag that is currently in `RooNLLVar` and that this PR moves to `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` [is not excluded from the IO](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooNLLVar.h#L82). I guess you had a good reason for this choice, so I kept the new flags in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` also for the IO. You think this is the right choice?.

I'm extremely hesitant to select llvm's option parsing for that purpose: we want to hide llvm's symbols; only libCling and rootcling are able to access them. But that means we cannot use the same option parsing for all of ROOT - and we'll be back in an inconsistent state where everyone and their binary will roll their own. Using e.g. the head-only http://optionparser.sourceforge.net or https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts . root.exe argument parsing is a lot simpler (eg, we need to handle -l -b -q and hardly something more complex). The advantage of using `llvm::cl` in rootcling is that we can encapsulate the arguments in data structures which are compatible with cling. For instance, after rootcling parses the arguments it can call a future overload of `cling::Interpreter::Interpreter(llvm::cl...` where it will pass already the processed arguments. Currently we have to convert back to `const char **argv`. This would be a drawback if we use a library different than `llvm::cl`. In theory, we can make `llvm::cl` work with the argument parser of root.exe by compiling the symbols of libLLVMSupport with -fvisibility=hidden (or instruct the linker to hide them). This way we will not leak symbols outside. Having that said, the value of this PR is the refactoring itself and not the library we use.

Modifiability,"> I am not in favour of this solution.; I don't think is bringing any advantages, we were using a plugin manager that was based on the interpreter and there were no direct dependency on fftw3.; Now you require people to directly install fftw3 and they would need to set also the include path. It is an over complication for the users. You are right, when building ROOT with `fftw3=ON`, it brings zero advantages but only makes if more fragile because `fftw3.h` needs to be in the path. *Edit*: it just came to my mind that this might actually be a rare case. Right now, `builtin_fftw3*` is always `OFF` by default, also on cfmfs. So the `fftw3.h` header was already found in the include path at build time, which means it's probably found when running ROOT too. However, in case where ROOT is built with `fftw3=OFF`, this makes the difference between the `RooFFTConvPdf` even working or not. And this case is relevant because we release the ROOT binaries like this. Since we need to make sure that FFTs work in RooFit when people install ROOT on their laptops with the binaries, I think a fix like this is necessary. Maybe as a compromise, I could apply the these changes only in case where `fftw3=OFF` by using preprocessor macros?

Unfortunately, it is impossible to implement these functions directly in TSQLStatement for all cases (database management systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle...) because of the following important reasons:; 1. The one possible function with fractions of a second which can be used in TSQLStatement to set and get TTimeStamp; `virtual Bool_t GetTimestamp(Int_t npar, Int_t& year, Int_t& month, Int_t& day, Int_t& hour, Int_t& min, Int_t& sec, Int_t& frac)`; has the last parameter defined everywhere as a fraction of a second without strict specification what fraction means: milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds...; For example, PostgreSQL returns microseconds, but MySQL supports and can return nanoseconds in timestamp value, So, if i don't know what a fraction i get via the function, i can't set TTimeStamp with nanoseconds.; 2. TTimeStamp class has timezone value (opposed to TDatime) and i must specify whether it is in UTC in the TTimeStamp constructor:; `TTimeStamp (UInt_t year, UInt_t month, UInt_t day, UInt_t hour, UInt_t min, UInt_t sec, UInt_t nsec=0, Bool_t isUTC=kTRUE, Int_t secOffset=0)`; But I don't know what timezone returns from the function above (in 1.). In PostgreSQL - TPgSQLStatement it is in UTC, in MySQL - TMySQLStatement it is not UTC. If it is specified that ""virtual Bool_t GetTimestamp(Int_t npar, Int_t& year, Int_t& month, Int_t& day, Int_t& hour, Int_t& min, Int_t& sec, Int_t& frac)"" function always returns microseconds in the last field (indeed, it is better in nanoseconds) and always in UTC format for all plugins/DBMS, new functions could be copied to TSQLStatement.

Could we have a discussion on the benefit/cost ratio?. Well, that raises an even more general question: if there is little commitment to touch/refactor/maintain old code, what is your long term strategy for these parts of ROOT then? Will these old codes be deprecated/removed then? Code rot is a fact and it gets only worse over time. And so far I have the feeling ROOT will still be there in the next decade or the one after. And if these codes stay around than they should be maintained and improved occasionally. Of course maintenance takes resources. And I know that nobody ever has time to do it. But leaving everything as is in the face of possible improvements also has a cost that we pay be doing nothing. For this particular PR, if I jump into a header file, I do not know which methods are overriding something from a base class. But this knowledge helps me when reading new code. Now I pay the cost for having to look this information up in the inheritance hierarchy. In recent years we are lucky enough to even have automatic refactoring tools. They are far from perfect. But they are good. And applying them has very little cost for a moderate benefit. So I think at least those automatic refactorings should be applied to old code. Regular manual refactoring of production code would be even better, but I know I live in a dream world here ;).

Modifiability,"> My question was: is it possible to modify the ROOT-cmake-find script, so that it only forces the nlohmann-json-dependency if you are going to use ROOT7 classes? So to say, that depending on the `REQUIRED COMPONENTS` that you use in the `find_package` statement in your user code, it is more or less 'requiring'. That's an interesting question. 🤔 CMake project's can't easily do this. I mean, nothing is impossible, but it's not simple to do. As long as externals are handled through imported library targets (which I'm not sure the nlohmann_json dependency is used with 😕), one would need to tweak the behaviour of CMake in a pretty fundamental way for this. 🤔 You see, when you tell in (in this case) ROOT's build that library `Foo` needs to publicly link against library `Bar::bar`, CMake exports this information in the `ROOTConfig-targets.cmake` file. (That is a file generated fully by CMake itself.) It will say that `Foo` depends on `Bar::bar`. So at that point `ROOTConfig.cmake` has to produce `Bar::bar` in some way. Even if the user's code itself never wants to use the `Foo` library. Because CMake will not like it that it has the `Foo` library defined (even if unused by others), without all of its requirements met. So even if `ROOTConfig.cmake` itself doesn't look for nlohmann_json, if any of the CMake code depends on the `nlhmann::json` target (yes, there is such a target in CMake 😄), the CMake configuration would still fail. With a complaint about `nlohmann::json` not being known. 😦. So generally, projects that publicly depend on something else, always look for all of those dependencies with [find_dependency(...)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.html).

Modifiability,"> So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Sorry, but no, this is not acceptable if you ask me. In fact, the need for a patched zeromq raises a big red flag as that may make it not possible to ever use a system version of zeromq if your pull request gets stuck. I agree with Axel that the right course of action is to add the needed functionality to zeromq directly first, then add this work to ROOT. I don't think that time constraints should be used as a way to get hackish code into ROOT. Alternatively, if your addition is really independent to zeromq, you could just add it to the RooFitZMQ library instead, so that you can use the system version of zeromq as is. If in a later version they add your new functionality, you can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. If RooFitZMQ only makes sense as a support library for RooFit::MultiProcess, it's better to put them together in a single pull request.

Can we extend the lifetime of `clang::ExternalASTSource::Deserializing::~Deserializing` eg register a deserialization upon say `findScope` and then delay the odr hash checks after things were fully deserialized?. Very creative idea :sweat_smile: what we can do is create our own `Deserializing` RAII in `findScope` because `ASTReader::FinishedDeserializing` will only do ODR violation checking on the last matching call. However, this also skips a number of other actions. As a result, I end up with an assertion for a cast of `FunctionDecl` - probably because some internal state is not correctly updated. In general, this approach sounds like treating the symptoms instead of the underlying cause, no?

There is the `_Float16` type that works one _some_ architectures with _some_ compilers, but this is to brittle. The most portable solution would be to use an `unsigned short`/`std::uint16_t`, but this comes with the caveat that it must first be converted into a proper `float` or similar representation to do anything meaningful with it, which seems to go against the other typedefs in `RtypesCore.h`.

Modifiability,"> The intent is the opposite. The RDirectory's internal representation and what it returns is a kind of shared_ptr. The user register the same name twice then if they hold a 'reference' to it, they keep and if they don't it is deleted. I do appreciate that as written it works and prevents a leak. New and delete have also worked for 20 years of root, and when written correctly do prevent leaks and get the job done, so there's no crisis of course. This offers a little more protection in some usages, but maybe new things to understand in others. I think stack-based lifetime management is simple, intuitive, encourages top-down code design and configuration, and avoids side effects. The smart pointer is interesting. It wasn't obvious to me that create would behave like shared_ptr::reset(), in the sense of allowing copies to persist (rather than redirecting some pointers they contain to the the new thing). . I kind of see a way now that it's possible to get the scalability (produce variable N plots at a time) without editing the PR routine. From my caller I'd need to call the subroutine, then do an RDirectory::Find() to get a shared pointer which will preserve the created thing, then call the routine again to get a new one. And if I still want to keep the first one for the interactive prompt, I have to make it global again with a new RDirectory::Add() of the contained thing, with a new name.

Modifiability,"> The motivation for this patch is that cling should not adjust itself to the PCHs of the client, pretty much the same way as clang. That seems to contradict the goal that a ROOT build should be relocatable. Let me retry to explain better:. ROOT is built on machine 1 with some flags, e.g. `-DMACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.1` (just making this up). Now we try to run this package on a different machine, where clang would (e.g. because of the Xcode version) set `-DMACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.2`. Before this used to work because the compiler config is taken from the PCH. This PR will break this case. Typical cases might be:; - not all compile time flags made it from the build of ROOT to ; - not all flags passed to rootcling when building the PCH are replicated by the Driver. You should be able to try by building ROOT with `CXXFLAGS=-Dfoo` and then running the resulting ROOT binary without. This works in master and should fail in your PR. This has been a real issue, seen with macOS and experiments, which triggered me to take the PCH compiler config as the source of truth, and not an unrelated config determined at runtime and potentially clashing with what we had when building the PCH. I believe several experiments currently still use ROOT build with a PCH due to issues with modules. As a way forward I propose:; - try the `CXXFLAGS` test I mention above; - check with your preferred experiment currently using PCH in production, to assert relocatability e.g. onto grid nodes.

It also seems that `R__HAS_DEFAULT_LZMA` isn't used anywhere, so it would be quite hard to set the default to that at the moment.

Modifiability,"@dpiparo - we discussed the idea of a condition variable, but I'm wary. The condition variable approach causes a per-task overhead that is _always_ paid (as notify would have to be done from the tasks). This per-task overhead is one of the things that make the pthreads implementation problematic. However, this particular case is a fairly obscure corner case: this code is only triggered when there is exactly one remaining basket to unzip, the main thread needs it, and one of the TBB threads is currently working on it. Talking to Zhe, I think the best way to go is a busy-loop (with `sched_yield` in the Linux case) instead.

Modifiability,"@pcanal : I agree that there is a limited danger of variable inconsistency. However, in ALICE, we are already doing it in a way similar to what you suggest: the ROOT variables are dynamically calculated and preset (before ROOT is launched) as part of the software stack initialization. There are no hard-coded things (and no one is supposed to change compiler paths on the GRID). Since we launch many ALICE-O2 executables, the preset actually needs to be done on a global level instead for every executable (otherwise we would not gain anything).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12613#issuecomment-1681837382:52,variab,variable,52,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12613#issuecomment-1681837382,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

Modifiability,"@pcanal The implementation is, logically speaking, exactly the same (see `TBufferFile.cxx:Read/WriteDouble32`. ; The main difference is design-wise, for the fact that RNTuple's quantization is:; - not bound to the type of the variable (you can quantize any `float` or `double`, not just a `Double32_t`; - not statically chosen (you can set the value range and the bit width at runtime rather than deciding once and for all via the variable comments). We can discuss in more details, but in my opinion those are the two main points of difference. The implementation itself is trivial and it's akin to `Read/WriteFastArrayDouble32` (but slightly more performant in principle, as it doesn't have to check the min/max/scale factor for each element - they are all the same within a call to Pack/Unpack). .

Modifiability,"After some investigation, it seems this issue is due to the priority level assigned to the two overloads. Specifically, the logic at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/896940ef8c0936ad394a1cf6b98d1d8fbaabbfff/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/CPyCppyy/src/CPPMethod.cxx#L408-L412. seems to aim at assigning higher priority to class types that have a deeper inheritance chain. In the reproducer above, this should translate to class `B` having priority 1 (because it has 1 base class `A`) and class `C` having priority 2 (because it has 2 base classes `A,B`). The function this logic relies on ([GetNumBases](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/87a998d48803bc207288d90038e60ff148827664/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy-backend/clingwrapper/src/clingwrapper.cxx#L1212)) in turn calls [TClass::GetListOfBases](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/87a998d48803bc207288d90038e60ff148827664/core/meta/src/TClass.cxx#L3620) which does not return all the bases in the full inheritance chain of the class, rather just the direct bases of a class. So in this case:; ```; >>> import ROOT; >>> ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(; ... '''; ... class A {};; ... class B: public A {};; ... class C: public B {};; ...

Modifiability,"Ah I start to remember why it's so complicated. We set the flags in the `SetUp(Linux|MacOS|Windows).cmake` scripts called in the `CheckCompiler.cmake` [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L130). But we have to call this after figuring out all the build flags, which is way after we call `project(ROOT)` [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L32). The questions is for me now whether we can ""just"" move the `project(ROOT)` after figuring out the build flags and then use the `*_INIT` instead of forcing the variable. Currently, we have to force it because otherwise we cannot change the defaults for which we want asserts in `RelWithDebInfo`.
