In this PR, the explicit registration is applied on components of `Sofa.Component.StateContainer`. The legacy RegisterObject mechanism is preserved and will warn the user at the compilation and at run-time. EDIT:. - add tests about plugins non-registering/registering implicitly/registering explicitly; - add deprecations/warnings in RequiredPlugin; - add a function registerPlugin in PluginManager. This function is simply an alias for loadPlugin() because loadPlugin() does much more than just loading a plugin by itself.

I have some ideas to reduce this code, but it requires work on the task scheduler.; - A small part of the code is duplicated from `HexahedronFemForceField`.; - Initially, I wanted to accelerate the execution of the Conjugate Gradient for `GraphScattered` types. It is not possible to propose a generic multi-threaded acceleration for all force fields: for FEM, the most time consuming step in the CG is `ForceField::addDForce`. This is the method to accelerate.

Security,"3 scenes were displaying an error following the PR #2465 . After some investigations, it appeared that those 3 scenes were not working for a while (and the PR merely showed that statement), and the culprit was that GridMeshCreator was not calling its doLoad() method.; doLoad() in MeshLoader components is triggered when d_filename is set.; But GridMeshCreator is procedural and does not any filename at all. Therefore doLoad() was never called.; This PR forcefully set the data d_filename to dirty to force-trigger the callback. Moreover, insertTriangle and insertQuad were using beginEdit()/endEdit() which were triggering also a doLoad() (resulting in a lot of useless edges/triangles); This PR uses WriteOnlyAccessor to avoid this problem.

Security,"@damienmarchal , discussions during the SOFA-dev meeting lead to a question over the developed design and your opinion is needed. . The problem was that some scenes tests where crashing at exit. This is due to the SofaPython3 cache (`s_objectcache` there https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/blob/1b5d271aa21df06c4c5ab75599e364adb0c1e9be/Plugin/src/SofaPython3/DataHelper.cpp#L252C1-L252C73) . The problem was that this is a static object containing python objects and is thus cleaned at the very end of the program exit, after the python interpreter, which is not authorized. . To fix it, following [pybind11 suggestions](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html) I've added a member to the module Sofa.Core that insured that the cleanup is called while the interpreter is still alive (see the PR https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/425). But is was not enough because the interpreter is not cleaned correctly either : the static method ""Release"" of SofaPython3, in charge of cleaning up python and deleting the interpreter was never called when launching scene in runSofa. . This lead to the need of cleaning up *explicitly* the plugin before exiting the main function. This design was not liked by every dev, some wanting a Raii-like cleanup, in the destructor of some member, which is in my mind not possible because the interpreter instance is static in the SofaPython3 plugin and thus we have no guaranty that it would not be deleted before any other static member.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216:574,authoriz,authorized,574,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216,1,['authoriz'],['authorized']

This PSDEFactory (Actually a DataFactory) may be an attribute of PythonEnvironment. . Now about merging the PSDE with the PythonFactory, this sound is a different issue to me. As far as I can say the PythonFactory is in charge of generating the python binding of the 'right' type for an object (so a BaseObject* to the right SofaPython.Binding_SpecificObject) while the PSDEFactory is more in charge of allocating the right Data<> type (a string to Data<something>). I think a closer factory to look is how the Data<> are converted to and from python type (eg when we are accessing them with the getattr/findData). . I didn't investigated to much but I also have several worries about the existing PythonFactory: ; - the long sequence of if-else to detect among a set of ""hard code"" (why those ones, why there is an implicit ordering), ; - the complexity to match a type seems to be linear with the number of type (so the more type there will be in the factory the slowest it will be).; - this linear search is done *each time* an object is crossing the Sofa to Python border (which means each time we use Python to access Sofa object we pay this price).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-389395402:749,access,accessing,749,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-389395402,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessing']"

Security,"@sescaida Thanks for the review; The reason why I didn't add examples for this PR is because the current examples themselves, without any modification, demonstrate that it works as-is, thus showing that the call to update() in the handleEvent method was redundant with the default DDGNode's update mechanism. Basically, if your scene is well created (links are properly made between datafields & data are correctly accessed by components lower in the scene graph), everything should work just as well as before. The only difference I would say, is that the user has the hand over the cleanDirty() method, which allows him to fix use cases where a read acces is performed on an input, after setting an output's value has been set, in update(). as for whether it is a good idea to keep that system, I must say, that I agree with you, as we discussed before: Bringing the complexity of the DDGNode's mechanism in Python might be something we want to avoid.; Although, I think that the good approach to fight this issue would rather be to solve the problem on the C++ side (simplifying the Data-Update mechanism) than to diverge from it by simplifying the Python process.; I think @damienmarchal woul be the best placed to give us a feedback on this question, maybe?

Security,"A new DataEngine is introduced: `FillReducingOrdering`. A DataEngine to reorder the degrees of freedom in a mesh in order to reduce fill-in in sparse matrix factorization. In other terms, the algorithm minimizes the number of non-zeros entries in the factorization of the sparse matrix of a FEM problem by reordering the degrees of freedom. The implementation is based on METIS. Note: some of the direct linear solvers embed such a reordering internally (e.g. SparseLDLSolver), but not all of them (e.g SparseLUSolver, SparseCholeskySolver etc). An example is also introduced (`examples/Components/engine/FillReducingOrdering.scn`).; Here is the comparison of the two system matrices:. Initial matrix:; ![initial_matrix00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10572752/143068764-2cbd09b4-906b-4bc1-b3c6-03cd3034a1ab.jpg).

It improves a lot the performances when the linear solver does not embed a fill-in reducing reordering. This is the case of the `SparseLUSolver` in the example scene.; Rough framerate without reordering: **2.5 FPS**; Rough framerate with reordering: **25 FPS**; ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Add two types in sofa: only header files that are not (yet) used by other components. ; The DataCallback allows to call a specific function after any modification of a data. in the declaration of the class ; ```; Data<double> d_data; DataCallback c_data; // I usually prefix with c_; ```. At the initialization of the constructor:; ```; : d_diff(initData(&d_diff, ""name"", ""desc"")); , c_diff(d_diff) // listen to d_diff data. The constructor of the DataCallback takes a data as reference; ```. Then anywhere (usually in the constructor body); ```; c_diff.addCallback(this,&MyComponent::myfunction1); ; c_diff.addCallback(this,&MyComponent::myfunction2); ; ```. The main difference with an existing type in sofa if the possibility to attach several functions and more importantly to specify the component on which the callback will be called. This allows to define callbacks as member functions of the component, which simplify access to parameters. Additional test are added allowing to modify the data while the callback is called (in order to avoid cyclic calls). This is usefull for linked data i.e. The callback receives a modification from the parent, the callback is then called and it is allowed to modify the data in the callback which will automatically call update of childs of the data. . The second type introduced in this PR is a wrapper allowing to easily associate a widget with a specific types of data. It can be used as follows: . in a cpp file; `sofa::helper::Creator<sofa::gui::qt::DataWidgetFactory, GenericDataWidget< Data<bool>, QtDataBoxEdit > >	DWClass_bool(""bool"",true);`. QtDataBoxEdit is a Qwidget class defined by the user that needs to define usual functions needed in sofa widgets : ; ```; void readFromData(const Data<bool>& data);; void writeToData(Data<bool>& data);; ```. And constructor must take as parameter the parent and the data as follows :; `QtDataBoxEdit(sofa::gui::qt::DataWidget* parent,const sofa::core::objectmodel::Data<bool> & data) : QCheckBox(parent)",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/911:926,access,access,926,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/911,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"Alright after digging a bit into the code, I noticed that the XML parser for SOFA has a builtin handling of (forcefully set to) empty strings in name, which has not been ported to SofaPython:. Basically the XML parser stores a map of instantiated components (typename, idx), uses the `shortname` of the component concatenated with the idx of the new instantiation.; For instance 2 MechanicalObjects would be called ""mObject1"" and ""mObject2"". I implemented the same mechanism in the bindings to stay coherent. This mechanism is not perfect though, as one could still easily trick it by creating any component and give it the name ""mObject1"".. but then who would purposely do that... For nodes, It's better handled because at the node's creation, I have access to the node's parent and can thus check the names of components / nodes in the parent to prevent duplications. Still, moving the node post-creation could still result in name duplications, of course. Also in the bindings I have no structure in which to put this map... meaning that It will not be resetted until the whole program restarts, which is kind of ugly (reloading the scene from the UI would not reset the map so the names would change from one execution to another (yuck). I'll remind you that the initial purpose of this code is to prevent creation of nodes/objects with an empty string as a name, not to prevent code duplication (which is a different issue and should be checked using the SceneChecker instead IMHO) Duplicated names can result in undefined behaviors, but empty names can lead to crashes (the component's pathname becomes corrupted).

Security,"An example is introduced for SquareMapping. In this scene, the goal was to verify that two methods are equivalent:; 1) A SquaredDistanceMapping is used to transform the DOFs from the 3d space to a 1d space (representing the squared distances between the DOFs). Then a spring acts in the 1d space; 2) A combination of two mappings: DistanceMapping and SquareMapping. It also transforms the 3d space to a 1d space where a spring is added. A unit test is added to check both methods are equivalent. However, we can observe that if the simulation runs long enough, both objects diverge.

Security,"Based on #2043. A new component is introduced: `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase`. As the name suggests, it is the parallel implementation of `BVHNarrowPhase`. ## Details. The broad phase provides a list of pairs of collision models. In the initial `BVHNarrowPhase` component, the list was processed sequentially. In `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase` each pair is processed in a task, which is given to a thread pool. Note that the traversal of the bounding volume hierarchy is not parallel. It is still single threaded. Due to race conditions, some operations must be done prior to the parallel tasks: . 1. Detection output creation. This operation is very time consuming (see #2047). If #2047 is merged, we can expect better results.; 2. Topology initialization. ## Results. The tested scene is `applications/plugins/MultiThreading/examples/ParallelBruteForceBroadPhase.scn` during 500 time steps. The narrow phase duration has been measured with `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase` compared to `BVHNarrowPhase`. ```; BVHNarrowPhase 3.5 ms; BVHNarrowPhase + PR#2047 2.36 ms; ParallelBVHNarrowPhase 2.1 ms; ParallelBVHNarrowPhase + PR#2047 0.97 ms; ```. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Based on #3548 . Similar to ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField. `addDForce` and `addKToMatrix` are the parallelized functions.; `addForce` is not parallelized. It would require to duplicate code from the base class. Hence a refactoring is needed for a proper implementation (in another PR). Note that `addForce` is usually not the bottleneck. Quick benchmarks show performances improvement on the provided example. I think there is still room for improvement in `addDForce`. But it would require a few changes in the base class. Instead of having a force vector for each task, I suggest to store only the force on the DoFs that have been visited during the task. I am not sure if it will bring more perfs improvements. In this PR, `addKToMatrix` is parallelized. It is not in `ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField`, but the same principle can be applied (in another PR). ______________________________________________________.

This work is not required during the accumulation as it is done later in any case. I propose to accumulate all the matrix entries in a simple list.

To create them, I had to make available a constructor that does not take a `initData`, therefore I made available all the constructors of `Data`.; A `TopologySubsetIndices` is created for each input of the mapping. They subscribe to the corresponding topology changes.; When a topology change (point removal only) occurs, the mapping propagates the changes to the output Node of the mapping (and also renumbers internal indices). The application of the topology changes require a `BaseMeshTopology` and a topology modifier in both input and output of the mapping. ______________________________________________________.

It gives the choice to the user to apply or not a fill-in reducing permutation on the matrix of the system. By default the boolean is true in order to keep the previous behavior. FEMBAR-SparseLDLSolver.scn average computation time (to solve the system) with permutation : 3.31 ms; FEMBAR-SparseLDLSolver.scn average computation time (to solve the system) without permutation : 2.05 ms; Benchmarck MatrixAssembly_direct_blocs.scn (with permutation) : 7,45 ms; Benchmarck MatrixAssembly_direct_blocs.scn (without permutation) : 114,39 ms. As the fill-in reducing permutation is computed following heuristic instructions, there may be some situation where it is not worth applying this permutation.

Security,"Based on https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3548. In the `addDForce` method, the parallel algorithm consists in computing a thread-specific `dF` and then combine them all in the main `dF`. It requires a synchronisation mechanism as it may create race conditions. This PR introduce an alternative method which is lock-free. It divides the model into smaller subdomains that can be solved in parallel without synchronization. Since the domains are visited sequentially (it's the elements of each domain that are visited in parallel), it comes with an overhead. Therefore, this method is particularly suited for large models where the overhead can be amortized. I have the following results on the provided example:. ```; 1000 steps ; 17775 elements (hexa). domain decomposition:; 35.1703 s ( 28.4331 FPS). naive:; 76.5666 s ( 13.0605 FPS). sequential:; 192.688 s ( 5.18974 FPS).; ```.

The base classes `SpringForceField` and `StiffSpringForceField` were also refactored to be able to reuse common code with their parallel implementations. Only the `addForce` method is implemented. The provided example has an explicit integration scheme where the force derivative is not required. `addDForce` and `addKToMatrix` may come later. Benchmark:. ```; Sequential; 1000 iterations done in 9.11327 s ( 109.73 FPS). Parallel; 1000 iterations done in 5.04016 s ( 198.406 FPS); ```. The implementation is naïve.

Security,"Currently in Sofa we aren't catching any exceptions. . The consequence is that every exception propagates to the top level exception handler halting the application. ; Un-handled exception are useful to detect bugs but this is a non-sense to use such top level handler to process possible application errors like failure to load a plugin or a scene. . A good approach should be that any exception that can be fixed without editting the source code (ie. but by editting the scene or changing some system configuration and so on) should ends with a gracefull error message indicating to the user how to fix the error cause. To implement this I suggest to:; - add a close to top-level try/catch block around simulations/plugin actions; - add a SofaSimulationException that has an error message, the component that emitted it and can have a backtrace as well as a top level reactions to do (eg: set componentstate to invalid and stop simulation).

Security,"Currently we have a very strict reviewing process to validate a PR for merging in master. This is very good because we now have a very stable master. But after one year I think our approach also tend to favor trivial ""micro changes"" against complex things. . Because they are hard to read, or review, or because they may eventually break something, big PRs are often rejected. This is a drama and I think that we should make en effort to facilitate much more these one because they contains real work (ie...an engineer spends several days or week that he (and is employer) is willing to offer to the community). Loosing those contributions is just a raw loss for the community. .

There is no need to be super pinchy on two or three micro-details of a 50h PR. (reviewers should instead contribute to the PR by fixing that details); - reviewers should be willing and adapt their reviewing time to the size of the PR.

Security,"Currently, when running runSofa without using the -g option for specifying if we want the GUI or batch, SOFA picks the last used one.

Security,"Dear SOFA community and @sofa-framework/reviewers,. As you know, one of our main objectives is currently to propose a major evolution of SOFA: this is the project ""SOFA-NG"", standing for Next Gen. ; Let us give you some insight about the final plan and the steps to reach these objectives. Any feedback is welcome. ## Objectives. The final objective of SOFA-NG is to refactorize the current (non-core) modules and components by moving them into plugins. It will permit to:; - compile and load only the necessary modules; - clean all dependencies in SOFA; - help focusing the work of validation/verification/doc/test on specific codes; - improve the packaging of codes; - ease understanding the API of SOFA for new users. ## Steps of implementation. Our concerns; - Focus on non-core components only; - Make the transition as smooth as possible; - Keep the history. Steps to follow; - Propose an architecture and a folder structure; - Decide a place for each component (incrementally); - Create the folder structure in SOFA plugins directory; - Pluginize one by one the components towards their new place. Note that this project; - will be documented, scripts will be provided to help the transition in plugins; - is compatible (can be run in parallel) with the deprecation task. ## Proposed structure. ~~https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v0~~; EDIT: latest proposal: https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v3.

Instead, use `sofa_find_package(Sofa.GL)` and Sofa.GL_FOUND,; - neither the **_preprocessor macro_** SOFA_NO_OPENGL in your h/cpp files. Instead, use the preprocessor macro YOURPLUGINNAME_HAVE_SOFA_GL (generated from the previous `sofa_find_package(Sofa.GL)` ). What this PR does:; - Propagate the removal of the **_preprocessor macro_** SOFA_NO_OPENGL in almost all the plugins; - remove in Sofa.Config the file option build_option_opengl.h , which has the nice effect to not recompile ALL sofa if you enable/disable the **_cmake option__** SOFA_NO_OPENGL; - some cmake fixes, in sofacuda especially.

Same problem with drawTriangle and drawPoint,; I suppose that these functions, at the beginning, was just needed to factorize OpenGL code (but still you needed to use OpenGL with it). ; Now that we remove the explicit calls, those functions should not be accessible outside.; But a few code in Sofa (and maybe plugins?) are using those calls to draw one primitive. Finally, what have been done:; - remove public visibility to those functions and rename it to internalDrawXXXX (where XXXX is point, triangle, quad); - keep the old calls to keep compatibility; - add addLine to keep consistency with the other primitives. I am wondering if in the future (or just right now), the drawXXX (drawing ONE primitive) should be removed and force users to use the drawXXXXs with a vector (and oblige user to build a std::vector with ONE primitive. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/293:400,access,accessible,400,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/293,1,['access'],['accessible']

Security,"Following recent changes, when compiled externally (out-of-tree), plugin libraries are not generated in the `plugin/` folder of SOFA build repository anymore, but in a dedicated `external_directories` folder. However this folder was not included in the reference folders (defined in `FileRepository.cpp`) in which the RequiredPlugin component searches for plugins at run time. This is not necessarily an issue when loading manually the plugins using the GUI's plugin manager, but it doesn't work when launching a scene which requires an external plugin in batch mode.

A base class for TopologicalMapping is introduced (BaseTopologicalMapping). It has no link to topologies. SubsetMultiMapping is now a BaseTopologicalMapping and has MultiLinks for input topologies and output topologies.; The consequence is that SubsetMultiMapping gets the propagation of the topological changes through the visitor `TopologyChangeVisitor`. It does not need any callback and subscribe to any topology. Note that `TopologyChangeVisitor` is now called on the root, rather than on the Node of the topology undergoing changes.

This is the list I had to specialize. ```template <>; void MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::vThreshold(sofa::core::VecId v, double t); {; // Do nothing; }; template <>; double MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::vDot(const core::ExecParams *, core::ConstVecId a, core::ConstVecId b); {; Real r = 0.0;; return r;; }. template <>; double MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::getConstraintJacobianTimesVecDeriv(unsigned int line, core::ConstVecId id); {; SReal result = 0;; return result;; }. template <>; void MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::applyScale(const double sx, const double sy, const double sz); {; }; template <>; void MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::storeResetState(); {; // store a reset state only for independent dofs (mapped dofs are deduced from independent dofs); if (!isIndependent()); return;; }. template <>; void MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::buildIdentityBlocksInJacobian(const sofa::helper::vector<unsigned int> &list_n,; core::MatrixDerivId &mID); {; }. template <>; SReal MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::vSum(const core::ExecParams *params, core::ConstVecId a, unsigned l); {; Real r = 0.0;; return r;; }. template <>; SReal MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::vMax(const core::ExecParams *params, core::ConstVecId a); {; Real r = 0.0;; return r;; }. template <>; void MechanicalObject<VNCS::F33D>::getConstraintJacobian(const core::ConstraintParams *cParams,; sofa::defaulttype::BaseMatrix *J,; unsigned int &off); {; }; ```.

Instead of just reverting to the classical static init, I have put all those inline static to constexpr members, leading to the fact that fixed_array's default constructor was not constexpr (forgotten 😗); Anyway, now everything is constexpr and the inline static initialization is correct now....

In this PR the target is not to expose GeometryAlgorithm in python, it is more to have a low-level API that propose geometrical object (c++ object, not BaseObject) and their associated operations as well as the corresponding binding to python. The key target of that this API is to be usable with as few as possible boilerplate code and without any scene graph/base/baseobject's folks. . So the SofaGeometry module proposed in this PR can be seen as 'one' level lower in the software stack that GeometryAlgorithm. The interest of this module is that it can be used as-is (API style), in C++ or in python. Of course it is possible to go one step further (in that case I suggest to do that in a different module and in a different PR) where the c++ object implemented in SofaGeometry are exposed in the SceneGraph by inhering from BaseObject. .

Security,"Hello,. Here are a few remarks and suggestions regarding this topic:. 1. I would be wary about relying on performance measurements from a blog post that is 8 years old and does not mention the exact platform and compilers used. Thread Local Storage (TLS) is highly dependent on OS, ABI, compiler, flags. Here is for instance a quick test using compiler explorer: https://godbolt.org/z/6ObfHR.; 2. one usage requiring ExecParams to have a thread-local storage was to be able to do asynchronous loops (mainly simulation and rendering) with full access to the scene graph without copies, by using copy-on-write for large Data and having each thread be assigned a ""version"" (called ""aspect"" per the published work that was used). See the MultithreadGUI for an example of this mechanism.; 3. As far as I know, all asynchronous/external rendering engines integrations that are used with Sofa relied instead on a design where the Sofa scene graph is not exposed but only visual meshes (based on SofaPhysicsAPI), therefore this feature was never enabled/tested in real applications so it can make sense to remove it.; 4. It would be interesting to measure if there are any performance gained from just removing the TLS qualifier (as done in PR #1129). I expect it to not be measurable, but performances can be surprising, which is why any optimization efforts should measure before and after ;); 5. If the TLS part of ExecParams is removed, then you should also remove everything that depends on it: MultithreadGUI, ExecParams::threadID, aspectID, AspectPool, *AspectVisitor, DDGNode::currentAspect()/copyAspect()/..., and all the aspect-related features in Data and Link. Otherwise all these code will be silently broken by the change.; 6. Note that this also makes ExecParams itself a bit pointless. The initial rational was that this provides a thread-safe way to set parameters controlling all codes in such a way that even if it is not explicitly passed in to all API calls, it can be queried with ExecPa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/1147#issuecomment-532775748:543,access,access,543,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/1147#issuecomment-532775748,2,"['access', 'expose']","['access', 'exposed']"

Security,"Hello,. The issue I have with this approach is that this make it very invasive, as Sofa is adding operators in std namespace for all types, even not its own. So within an application that could also does the same, we would get conflicts / redefinition / ambiguity compiler errors, or worse silently override the application's own operators that could have relied on a different string syntax. I agree that the approach of subclassing the standard containers just to be able to package them within a Data is wrong. In our current branch we are refactoring the approach, relying more on `DataTypeInfo` to generically access features like string parsing, without having to put them in the type itself.

Security,"Here is a short feedback of what we have done since the STC : . **First strategy :** Model the Data accesses using ORWL's concepts + high level task parallelism (coarse grain parallelism); - use abstract Data accesses stored in FIFOs to extract parallelism : thread safe data accesses allowing concurrent reads.; - ensures that the semantic of the program is preserved.; - tasks defined at Visitor level : a Task is defined as the execution of a Visitor on a component.; - this strategy should apply to all visitors and components, as it does not depend on the nature of the component. **Issues :** ; - We wanted to use the Data class, since all accesses to a data object in sofa should be done using this class. Problem : this is not true, some components use vectors directly, or use Data methods / ReadAccessor / WriteAccessor not as intended (this is possible since for now some methods such as Data::endEdit do nothing) -> we would need to look at all sofa components to make sure that the Data are properly used; - To properly model the data accesses using ORWL's concepts we need to slightly modify the API of the Data class; - sofa Engine mecanisms are complex to handle using FIFOs; - it is difficult to predict the data dependencies as the Visitors are launched dynamically and can launch Visitors -> we can't predict the data accesses in a preprocessing phase, so we need to adapt ORWL.; - This approach would not induce significant performance gains on simulations with only 1 object or with 1 ""main"" object since all the computationally intensive tasks inside a given object access the same Data object (Write access) and thus are inherently sequential. **Conclusion :** the potential speedup is not good enough to invest more time on this strategy given the difficulty. **Second strategy :** finer-grain parallelization; To extract parallelism from highly data-dependent tasks we need to divide these tasks into less-dependent subtasks.; To achieve that, we are currently implementing pa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792:100,access,accesses,100,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792,4,['access'],['accesses']

Usually, a function executing on different components will access the same data vectors while executing on each component (for example MechanicalVisitor::fwdForceField, calls addForce or addDForce on each component, each one modifying the force vector).; We define a **Parallel Section** as the execution of a given visitor function on a list of components.; We define a **Task** as the execution of a visitor function on a component. Therefore a parallel section is decomposed in an ordered list of tasks.; Each task accesses a given set of vectors (read or write accesses), and a given set of locations in these vectors. We can split the tasks in **phases** such that each phase accesses a subset of the vector locations. To facilitate this, we decompose the vectors into **blocks**, and we look at the vector blocks accessed by each task phase.; Then we can have phases of different tasks that do not accesses the same locations, and so are independent and can run in parallel.; Then we model the dependencies between the tasks phases, and we use the dependency graph to schedule the parallel executions of the phases, keeping the sequential order of the operations. . All the user should have to do is to flag visitors that can be launched in parallel on the components : use a parallel version of Visitor::for_each / for_each_r to enable parallel execution of the components. **Steps performed at runtime:**. 1.

To me, a force-**field** intrinsically means a discrete geometrical representation of a domain from a topology (it could even be meshless having the field discretized with point-cloud neighbourhood topologies). To me, a forcefield could even **inherits** the topology class itself! . But then you find components such as **ConstantForcefield** or **LinearForcefield**, which contradicts my previous statement :-( They are however useful when you are computing the nodal forces externally and fill in the values in sofa. Therefore, the solution of @damienmarchal seems good to me, as it does not prevent forcefields without topological fields. It will however restrict the forcefield to one topology link only (which makes sense to me...but we never know). Or you could also add an additional **MultipleTopologicalLink** class in addition to the **TopologicalLink**, or make the **TopologicalLink** handles the ""0 to many"" dependency link. Another solution could be to add this ""0 to many"" data-link directly in the ForceField base class. Forcefields could fill this data in their respective **init** stage in the case the user didn't provide any and make proper checks to validate that the topology objects contains the right type of elements needed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/979#issuecomment-490135316:1237,validat,validate,1237,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/979#issuecomment-490135316,1,['validat'],['validate']

If I understand correctly now we can have the two syntax to read vectors (the one from Python and the historical one). +Backward compatibility is preserved and you added tests to validate the new behavior. This all looks great to me. . You also changed the getStringValue...here I think this is a problem as it will break a lot of third party code. This is why you had to fix a lot of failing test. Instead of changing the behavior of an existing function it would be much better to offer a second function to serialize to python format (or adds a parameter to the existing one to control the behavior eg: getStringValue(SerializingMode mode=SerializingMode::ClassicSofa)). The underlying idea is that by default old code will function as usual and ""awared"" users can take profit of the existing function getStringValueAsPython() or getStringValue(SerializingMode::Python). . I'm sorry because I think it probably took you a lot of time to update the failing tests but the tests shouldn't have been changed, only new one should have been added to validate the new syntax and corner case. .

Security,"Hi Thomas,. You said:; ""As long as the deserialization operator is compatible with the serialization one, I do not see any issue. And no example scene is failing because of that."". You have to take the whole picture into consideration, everyone is not using serialization/deserialization as ""pairs"". The actual default serialization format is used in a lot of other software (GUIs, scene processing tools written in python, perl and C++). If you change the behavior of the default serialization mechanism all of them will stop working and required to be updated. This is a very, very, very nasty thing to impose to other users of Sofa. A PR doing has no changes to be accepted. . Actually tests is part of our guard line because they validates the API compatibility and allow us to detect changes that breaks it. The existing tests should be considered as validating the ""the existing"" sofa API. It was normal to have them to fail on your PR because it shows that the PR was breaking the compatibility. . I really like the idea of keeping the old serialization behavior as it is and add the other deserialization as an extra feature. This will make the whole PR transparent for users that don't want to update their code base. It thus it can be merged very quickly. .

And also as you said having tests to validate against the real values instead of their serialization would be nice. . .

Security,"Hi!. When building plugins as standalone projects, the SofaFramework package doesn't expose the cmake config options used to build SOFA.; In the SoftRobots plugin (among others), tests are performed to know if SOFA has been built using the required options (such as SOFA_BUILD_METIS, MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER, PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON, SOFA_BUILD_TESTS etc.) and out-of-tree configurations require to re-specify those options, even though they are only defined in the SOFA build. I've modified the SofaFrameworkConfig.cmake.in to expose those options to whoever does a find_package(SofaFramework), although that might not be the smartest way to do it (the list is non exhausive and it would be best if options were added in a smarter way.; I think that modules such as SOFASPARSESOLVER should export the MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER themselves for instance, and so should the plugins.; But then there's also a long list of options that would be worth exposing, such as:; - SOFA_BUILD_TESTS; - SOFA_BUILD_METIS; - SOFA_BUILD_TUTORIALS; - SOFA_WITH_DEPRECATED_COMPONENTS; - SOFA_WITH_THREADING; - SOFA_WITH_DEVTOOLS; - SOFA_USE_MASK; - ....

Security,"Hi, . This PR follows the changes made in BarycentricMapping (i.e use of spatial hashing to find the nearest points instead of an exhaustive search). This new PR:. 1. Handle cases of several grid cells having the same h index. In such case, the distance between two points, that have the same h index, should be computed only if the points are in the same grid cell. This PR add this implementation. Each element is now stored in the hash table with its corresponding grid cell indices. 2. The nearest point, in a shared grid cell, may not be the global nearest point. To improve that, we detect when neighboring cells may contain a better solution, and do the check. These additional computations are still far better than the exhaustive search. . ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/896:81,hash,hashing,81,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/896,2,['hash'],"['hash', 'hashing']"

Security,"I have several objections with this PR. ; - the mechanism relies on a specific symbol lookup. So in order to make a plugin auto-loadable, you need to recompile the plugin which design wise is not so great. ; - It also has the major downside of having to load the library to know if the plugin is auto-loadable, which in the end results in having to load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file.

I have an error related to ssl (similar error to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53805704/tls-initialization-failed-on-get-request). It requires additional components in the Qt installation. I did not try it myself because it changes the installation process of SOFA. So before going further, we need to conclude that this feature is desirable (and is not a gadget).

Security,"In a mapped state, force fields and masses contribute to the global system matrix via a projection provided by mappings. The term $m M+ k K$ is assembled locally (association with the mapped state), and then the product $J^T (m M+ k K) J$.; However, in most cases, $M$ is constant. In addition, in some cases $J$ is also constant. If we fulfill the conditions so that both $M$ and $J$ are constants, we can extract the product $J^T M J$ and pre-compute it once at the beginning of the simulation. This is what this PR does. In addition to the pre-computation, there is a cache invalidation mechanism on masses to track when $M$ is subject to changes. For example, changes in the mass parameter by the user. This pre-computation is the most efficient when there is a difference of sparsity between $M$ and $K$. And this is the case when hyper-reduction is involved. $K$ is super sparse (only a few elements are considered), while $M$ gets contributions from all the nodes of the detailed mesh.

Security,"In the `getValuePtr` methods, a buffer on vector data is obtained by actually returning a reference to the vector first element. However the case where the method is called on an empty (but valid) vector is not handled. This may lead to an execution error, for instance when using SofaPython3 to assign values to a component's Data dynamically. This specific scenario is the object of a second PR in SofaPython3 [(link to the PR)](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/318). To change this, we propose to use the `std::vector.data()` method, which handles the case when the vector is actually empty (however returning a pointer that may or may not be null).

Security,"In this PR, `map_ptr_stable_compare` is preferred over `unordered_map`, as it allows reproducible contact response. However, `unordered_map` is still a lot faster. #2047 leads to a crash in `examples/Components/collision/RayTraceCollision.scn`. I suspect the cause of this crash existed before #2047, and that #2047 revealed the crash by processing the contacts in a non-deterministic order. With the non-deterministic order, I can see that the crash does not happen always at the same current time step. It even happened that there was no crash. Currently, I am not able to fix the crash. But I will continue investigating. As a workaround I restore the stable map to have deterministic contacts. IMO, it hides the cause of the crash. In the end, I think the stable map should be proposed to the user (as a parameter?) by default.

Security,"It is preferable to force the `constexpr` context:. ```cpp; static constexpr ResolutionMethod NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient(""NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient"");; if (d_resolutionMethod.getValue() != NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient); {; ```. The compiler may not choose to use `constexpr` in:. ```cpp; if (d_resolutionMethod.getValue() != ResolutionMethod(""NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient"")); {; ```. Therefore, no `constexpr` check if `NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient` is not in the list. There is a runtime check though. The type allows to deprecate a key if desired (I am thinking about the Data `method` in the FEM force fields). There is also a description of each key. And the whole list (key + description) can be added easily in the description of the Data, hence in the documentation. The major problem is about the GUI. More particularly, when a Data is read to be displayed in the GUI. Here, each of the `SelectableItem` is a new strong type. So there is no `DataTypeName`, `DataTypeInfo` etc for the new type. I tried to factorize with a common base class (`BaseSelectableItem`) but without success. I tried to define `DataTypeName`, `DataTypeInfo` etc for `SelectedItem` but without success. The consequence is that I cannot specialize a widget for this type of Data. ______________________________________________________.

Security,Many thanks Matthieu for the time you spend on carefully reviewing this PR I appreciate. . For the movement of function in a file...my mistake I should have clean that...I tried other changes (like extern template specialization) that I finally not took into consideration in this PR but forgot to clean the file so they seems to have moved more than what they actually did. . You are right about performance issues and your suggestion for checking the first non-empty char in getUnsignedInteger looks ok so I will make the change. . Now about the getInteger vs atoi aspect my first impression is that there will be a small performance difference at the cost of scarifying correctness and code security so I really advocate for using getInteger/getUnisgnedInteger and not atoi. . To go further we probably have to measure the performance but I wouldn't be surprised to be less than a 10% speed difference so it is not worth the loss of good error reporting to user. If high performance is really an issue I prefer to put energy to implement a raw binary storage of indices because this would make things like 10x or more faster speedup as well as have less memory consumption.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856:694,secur,security,694,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856,1,['secur'],['security']

Security,"Most of the components in `Sofa.Core/behavior` work by accessing one or more mechanical states, in order to access state variables, such as position, force etc. They all manage their own way to store, find and manage their link to one or more mechanical states. Instead, I suggest to factorize this access using intermediate classes. It comes with the following features:. - All components inherit from `StateAccessor`, which contains a dynamic list of `BaseMechanicalState`; - Components having access to only one mechanical state inherit from `SingleStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes>`.; - Components having access to 2 mechanical states inherit from `PairStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes1` and `DataTypes2`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes1>` and a second link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes2>`.; - Components inheriting from `SingleStateAccessor` or `PairStateAccessor` fill the dynamic list contained in the `StateAccessor` implementation.; - It does not break the previous accesses, variable names etc. The goal is that all the components accessing a `BaseMechanicalState` can provide a list of them in a generic way. For example, `BaseInteractionForceField` supposed only 2 mechanical states. Since it inherits now from `StateAccessor`, it can have links to more than 2 (note that none of the interaction force field I found work with more than 2). Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`. I also cleaned the files:; - Concatenate nested namespaces; - Use `#pragma once`; - Some private and non-defined copy constructors and `operator=` are marked `delete`.; - Move methods in cpp; - Removed unnecessary `init()` implementations. They only called their base class `init()`.; - `Constraint ` ha",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2438:55,access,accessing,55,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2438,5,['access'],"['access', 'accessing']"

Security,"PR adds a first implementation of the augmented lagrangian collision (see [A Surface-to-Surface Finite Element Algorithm for Large Deformation Frictional Contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056201/pdf/bio-17-1579_081013.pdf)). . To do so, because it is very close to the classical Unilateral constraint, I've tried to factorize code by adding a virtualization layer for both the constraints and the associated contact responses (see added class BaseContactLagrangianConstraint and BaseUnilateralContactResponse). It rely on a contact param template which is the only thing that differs in term of data and of course the type of ConstraintResolution used. . An example scene is introduced in the Demo folder, simply copying the falling beam example and replacing the response by the augmented lagrangian one. . There are still one todo for the future, even if this PR is already working on its own : adding the per-contact-point penalty modulation. This should be done by going back to the collision element using the DetectionOutput.elem attribute. This allows to go back to the topology. The only unknown is how to compute the element volume when the colliding topology is mapped to the simulated one. .

The benchmarks show that insertion of 3x3 blocs is faster in 3x3 bloc-based CRS matrices than before (the test `Add3x3Bloc_CRS3x3d`).

Security,"Remove damping correction to the RHS because it is already added in the computeForce. In a Euler implicit integration scheme, the right hand side expression only contains terms coming for the internal and external forces taken at the begining of the timestep, and an inertial term constituted of the stiffness matrix, but no term coming from the constitutive damping. (see [Christian Duriez HDR](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00785118) for ref). The contribution of the damping forcefield is already taken into account through the `computeForce` call line 126, so the `b` coefficient should be put to 0 here otherwise the behavior is not correct. . This can bee reproduced by launching the scene `examples/Component/SolidMechanics/FEM/DampingForceField.scn` and putting the data `implicit` of the damping forcefield to true. This data might have been introduced to fix this error, because here we are in an implicit scheme, and setting this parameter to true when the `b` coef is equal to 1 changes the behavior. .

Security,"Sorry for the delay !. First, I have some precisions regarding Fred's remark: with the modification I suggested, I see a critical performance drop in the caduceus scene, going from ~150-200 FPS before the change, to ~25 FPS after. I expect that, indeed, the barycentric mapping accesses the `m_positions` field of the `OGLmodel`, consequently causing extensive triggering of the callback at each time step. So the solution I first suggested should be discarded anyway. @hugtalbot, using the `m_restPositions` field for the callback doesn't have the same performance issue. However I believe that this field is not used in the rendering process of the `OglModel`. Or, at least, calling `initVisual()` after a change of `m_restPositions` doesn't change the visual. So this solution doesn't solve the initial issue I had. I tried to look into how the `BarycentricMapping` works in details, but I'm afraid it is a bit too complexe for me with the time I have at the moment... My idea was to find how the barycentric mapping makes sure that the visual OGLModel is updated at each time step, and mimick this. If someone is familiar with the process ?. In the meantime, regarding the specific scenario I was working on, I'm using another workaround. Instead of dynamically changing the source file of the loader, I'm creating as many loaders as mesh files I have, and I dynamically change the loader I need at a given time during the simulation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2925#issuecomment-1137038775:278,access,accesses,278,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2925#issuecomment-1137038775,1,['access'],['accesses']

Security,"TaskScheduler was doing several things:; - A base class for task schedulers; - A factory to register and create task schedulers. The factory code is extracted from the TaskScheduler class and moved into its dedicated class and file. I refactored a bit how the factory works:; Before, it was like there could be only one TaskScheduler at a time. Everytime a new TaskScheduler was created, the previous one is destroyed. It prevents the use of multiple TaskScheduler with different type (derived class). Instead, the task schedulers are now stored in a map. ; The only issue is related to the task allocator. The task allocator is used every time a task is created. The task allocator is supposed to depend on the TaskScheduler where the task will be added. But in practice, a Task is created independently from the TaskScheduler. So I kept the old system that calls a static function setting the allocator when the task scheduler is created.

I just checked your pull request and I really like its simple usage - I hope it will be merged soon! . @damienmarchal : I am excited to see your solution to 3., if you would like to have further information about my approach, please let me know. To create python scenes, I am using the [scene to python transform script](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/master/applications/plugins/SofaPython/scn2python.py) and with the direct usage your approach works well, i.e.; `applications/plugins/SofaPython/scn2python.py examples/Demos/caduceus.scn -o caduceus2 -p`; generates the python scene `caduceus2.py` and when launching it I can retrieve all the arguments of the command line, i.e. the output of ; `runSofa caduceusPython.scn --argv test test2`; is `['caduceusPython', 'test', 'test2']`. However, by default (i.e. without -p) the scene to python transform script generates a .scn file calling a .py file - a choice made to prevent having to load the python plugin before launching python scenes. For example; `applications/plugins/SofaPython/scn2python.py examples/Demos/caduceus.scn`; outputs the caduceusPython.scn and caduceusPython.py. Now when using ; `runSofa caduceusPython.scn --argv test test2`; and running ; `print sys.argv`; only the filename can be retrieved, i.e. the output is `['caduceusPython']`. 1. Is the usage presented as second approach (i.e. using .scn and .py) still up to date/a recommended approach?; 2. If yes, is it possible to access the argv in the .py file when it is used from the .scn file?

Security,"Thanks for the explanation,. So, when GLOBAL is set the friction coefficient came from the mu parameter and when {MINIMUM, AVERAGE, GEOMETRIC, PRODUCT} is set the friction coefficient is computed from the objects with the corresponding function. . If so, I agree that a GLOBAL flags in addition to MINIMUM, AVERAGE, GEOMETRIC and PRODUCT would make sense. I also agree with maxim's that ""In any case I would favour clamping negative mu to zero together with some warning displayed since mu < 0 is a modelling error anyways."". It could also be nice to display a warning when 'mu' is set while GLOBAL is not to inform users they are maybe mis-understanding something (and provide an advice on how to fix the problem). . Finally I also have the feeling that the ""horizontal"" data field could also be improved by renaming it with something like ""coneProjection"" with two possible values: [""horizontal"" and ""orthogonal""] instead of using a boolean.

Security,"The PSDE works similar to a function block in Simulink or comparable software. The user can define a block (a PSDE) declaring its Inputs, Outputs (I/Os) and its behavior using Python alone. It has some similarities with the ""PythonScriptController"" (PSC). The two main differences are:. - PSDE-objects are not triggered by events (not conceptually at least). Rather, the functionality should be implemented in the update() function of the associated script, which is called once per simulation frame. ; - I/Os can be added directly to the object inside the parse() function of the PSDE-object. Linking using the '@'-syntax also works. Therefore, the PSDE-object behaves like any other object that has I/Os (or Data in general). Inside the script these newly defined I/Os can be accessed as members of the object, providing an easy syntax. You can think of the PSDE as a possibility of subclassing the Sofa 'DataEngine' in a scripted way.

Security,"The actual implementation to store parentData is weird because it stores two times the same object. One is in the base class (parentBaseData) and one in its child class; (parentData). . The rational behind the current implementation is that we wanted to access the data without abstraction cost, ie. accessing the object with its true type (eg: Data<T>) instead of its parent type (BaseData) and at the same time having an abstraction to manipulate BaseData. . Duplicating the same obect/point is in general a code smell indicating that something is wrong in the implementation. In general duplication complexify the implementation and error prone (because you have to garantee that the different copies are kept synchronized and interact together in a seamlessness way. . So, in this PR I addresse this duplication problem by removing the lowest type and relying on a dynamic_cast when it is needed. There is an abstraction cost...but it is on a on a very rarerly used method (actually only used for fast copy of data field...and in that context...the cost of the dynamic cast against one of copying millions of Dofs is totally neglectible). . A different pattern was initially used with a child-delegation to expose the abstraction to its parent but it appears it would have made the PR breaking. The difference is that the selected pattern allows one data to be parented to a data of different type while the pattern with child-delegation restrict the parenting to be of exactly the same time. . I personally prefer to have parent only on same type (so that data conversion must be added manually and becomes explicit) but this was not done previously in Sofa and thus breaks some scenes (somes of them are actually really funny....and probably work only by side effect). . ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] ",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490:254,access,access,254,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessing']"

Instead, their equivalent are available as free functions.

The global variable `Simulation` is set once and for all in the initialization of the `Sofa.Simulation.Graph` module. ⚠️ If `new` is used to provide a new `Simulation`, it results in a memory leak, because `setSimulation` now does nothing. In summary, the type `Simulation` is now only useful to create `Node` instantiations. This feature can be done out of the Simulation class thanks to a refactoring of modules. It will be done later in another PR. Once it is done, the type could be deprecated.

I find the trait approach elegant (nothing is hidden and no use of macro or additional code), but too much verbose when only one template parameter is available (e.g. `TetrahedronFEMForceField`). The advantage of the macro is that it does not require changes in the code other than the alias declarations. ______________________________________________________.

The functions introduced in this pull request allow to apply a function to a range in parallel.; Unit tests are provided.; The newly added functions are used as example in two places:; - GenericConstraintSolver: the code is unique for both sequential and parallel execution; - ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField: no ambiguity: the code is only for parallel execution. But nothing prevent to have a code supporting both sequential and parallel execution. But the component is not totally ready for a merge with HexahedronFEMForceField. Note that it avoids a lot of boilerplate code, hence reducing the complexity of the file. I think this will allow us to write more multithreaded code. In the back, the parallel loop uses a task scheduler and divides the number of elements in `n` ranges, where `n` corresponds to the number of threads in the task scheduler. This is to execute exactly `n` tasks, instead of `m`, if `m` is the number of elements. It avoids the overhead of creating a task for each element. It is more efficient when the number of elements is large. Benchmarks are yet to perform. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"The never-ending quest of eradicating implicit type conversion. This PR contains two things:. 1) Introduction of a user-defined literal for SReal constants.; 2) Avoid implicit conversions. **Introduction of a user-defined literal for SReal constants**. When dealing with constants that should be SReal, I saw the the following behavior in the SOFA code base:. - The `SReal` type is ignored and the constant is considered either as a double or a float, or any other primitive type. Example: `Vector3(1.f, 1.f, 1.f)`, `Vector3(1., 1., 1.)`, or `Vector3(1,1,1)`.; - The constant is C-style cast. Example: `Vector3( (SReal)1, (SReal)1, (SReal)1)`; - The constant is `static_cast`. Example: `Vector3( static_cast<SReal>(1), static_cast<SReal>(1), static_cast<SReal>(1))`. The first option is what we want to avoid. The second option has some problems that the third can solve. However, the third option is ugly, long and can be complex to read. To simplify such expressions, I introduced a user-defined literal. Example: `Vector3(1_sreal, 1_sreal, 1_sreal)`.

In this PR I try to fix the situation by allowing three states:; - lock = true => changes in the scene graph are not reflected into the model but the model is flagged as dirty ; - lock = false => changes in the scene graph are imediately reflected into the model; - dirty => true => the model is not anymore synchronized with the sofa scene graph; - dirty => false => the model is showing the content of the scene graph. when going from lock=true to lock=false the model is updated if it was dirty. . To let user to control if they want the graph to be updated we add an icon to lock/unlock the model state. If the model is dirtyfied; a the icon is reflecting the change (with an highly professional icon free of copyright ;)) . Fixes #2920 . The PR also contains few fixes for the modeller (that is still broken anyway). . ______________________________________________________.

Security,"The usual pattern of component classes is the following:. - A generic method is defined in the base class of the component. Since it is generic, it does not know the type of the `DataTypes` (it's not templated). Instead, it acts on `VecId`.; - In a second base class, inheriting from the first one, the `DataTypes` is known (the class is templated). Therefore, the methods can be defined to work on the right type.; - In this class, the generic method calls the template-specific one. IMO, the template-specific method should not be public. In this PR, they are moved to protected. I think also, that the generic methods can be final, but this is breaking, so I am not sure that it is a good idea to keep the final keyword. The PR starts with the `final` keyword to study the consequence on the CI. Those changes force the user to call only the generic methods. I took the opportunity to add a check on the component state in the generic methods. If the final keyword is used, it would ensure that the component state is called before each call of the public API. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"There is a primary template class that can act on any type (not just Data). In this case, the class is a simple proxy.; A second implementation partially specializes the class for vector types. Again, no need to be a Data. The type needs to implement the `begin` and `end` methods, and the `[](int)` operator, to be considered a vector type.; Finally, a third implementation partially specializes the class for Data. This specialization uses one of the first two implementation: `template<class T> class ReadAccessor<Data<T> > : public ReadAccessor<T>`.; We can say that accessors are meant to be used for Data only, but they need the implementations for any type (the type that is contained by the Data). And those implementations can be tested, even if they are not used. Worth to be noted:; `std::vector` is of course considered as a vector type. If I want to use it through an accessor, it matches the partial specialization for vector types. However, accessors for vector types require the type `Size` in the vector type (there is an alias). `std::vector` has not such a type, so the compilation fails. Accessors to vector types can be used only for `sofa::type::vector` (and its derived types). Conclusion: ; 1) there is a discrepancy between the `is_vector` type trait and the requirements of the accessors.; 2) Write `ReadAccessor<std::vector<Real> >` or `ReadAccessor<Data<std::vector<Real> > >` does not compile. To fix this behavior, I'll suggest in another PR something like; ```cpp; using Size = std::conditional_t<hasSizeSize<T>::value, T::Size, T::size_type>;; ```.

Security,"There were only a few tests on NameDecoder in `SofaKernel/modules/SofaCore/SofaCore_test/objectmodel/BaseClass_test.cpp`. I created a dedicated file to test the main functions in NameDecoder. It required changes in some of the algorithms to comply with the added test:. - Support of nested classes; - Spaces are processed in the first pass of the algorithm, instead of adding a second pass just for spaces. This is also to detect when spaces must be skipped or not (always skipped before). For example, it must not be skipped in `unsigned int`.; - Returned string get a balanced number of opening chevrons and closing chevrons. Note: Anonymous namespaces are not supported (yet?).; Note 2: The algorithms in `NameDecoder` are complicated to read. It is hard to anticipate the result. IMO, it's due to the fact that it is written to be executed in a single pass. I think allowing multiple passes would help to read and debug these functions. `decodeTemplateName` was never called.

Security,"This PR aims to handle in a more ""contained"" way the components implemented in different plugins to avoid having everything mixed into the ObjectFactory. . The PR is composed of two aspects. 1) **Registering components by ""plugin.classname"" instead of ""classname"" in the ObjectFactory**. The factory currently access component by their classname only causing collision when two component have the same name/template. To avoid this, the PR add the plugin name as a prefix for the Factory'key. As an exemple, a component created with *<OglModel>* in the past is now referenced as *<SofaOpenglVisual.OglModel>*. Backward compatbility is possible by adding into the factory registration an alias mapping between ; new names and old name;; Eg:; ```; ""OglModel"" => ""SofaOpenglVisual.OglModel""; ```. 2) **Importing plugin and component *à la* python**; A new component called *FromComponent* is added to handle the loading of plugin and the import of object. . Examples of use:; ```; 	 # To make only <OglModel> accessible in the scene; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel""/>; 	<OglModel/>. 	# To add ""custom"" name in a scene ; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel"" as=""RenderingModel""/>; 	<RenderingModel/>. 	# To be a super lazy man and import everything; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""*""/>; ```.

Security,"This PR shows how to replace sofa::type::Mat with Eigen::Matrix. The goal was to minimize the amount of code change in the code base. Several difficulties arise:; - `sofa::type::Mat` initializes the values, but `Eigen::Matrix` don't; - `sofa::type::Mat` relies on the [] operators from `fixed_array`. I tried to add the [] operators in `Eigen::Matrix`, but too much cases makes it difficult. Maybe not impossible.; - `sofa::type::Vec` must also be a `Eigen::Vector`, but `Eigen::Vector` is a `Eigen::Matrix`, so all the methods we add in `Eigen::Matrix` are also available in `Eigen::Vector`, but sometimes it does not make sense. So conditions must be added on the availability of those methods. Because of those difficulties, the replacement is not simple. This PR is not finished.

Security,"This is a fix for a very specific situation. Here is what happens:. 1. A `msg_warning` is called in a component from a thread different from the main thread. It could be also `msg_error` or `msg_info`, as long as the message count of the element changes. It could be a change of name as well.; 2. The `ObjectStateListener` associated to the component updates the associated `QTreeWidgetItem` (this class is not a `QObject`).; 3. The icon is updated, so it warns the `QTreeWidget` (this class is a QObject) through a signal.; 4. Since the call happens in a thread different from the main thread, the queued connection is used. For that, all signals/slots parameters must be known to Qt's meta-object system. This PR registers the class `QVector<int>`, so it can be used in the queued connection. It partially fixes https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3610. The warning is no longer triggered by Qt. Therefore, the mutex is locked only once in one thread.

Security,"This is a way to explicit the narrowing conversions in SOFA. Instead of using the classic `static_cast`, this function can check if the value changed after the cast. It can happen in case of narrowing conversion, when the target type is smaller than the source type.; Since the check must be performed at run-time (affects the performances), it is enabled only in DEBUG mode. The idea is to use this cast everywhere the compiler warns about possible data loss and it's not possible to avoid a narrow conversion (e.g. by adapting both target and source types).

At the moment, file parsing in MeshGmsh.cpp and MeshGmshLoader.cpp is (hopefully) correctly handled, including more recent MSH file formats (=>4.0).; EDIT: I don't fully understand how the loader works, mainly why MeshGmshLoader::readGmsh() is temporarily not used (commented in l.111), with the parsing apparently relying only on MeshGmsh::readGmsh(). However I tried to keep the same structure as before, simply taking into account the case where the .msh version is > 2.; A .msh file with version 4.1 is added (share/mesh/msh4_cube.msh), and its parsing by the MeshGmshLoader is tested both in examples/Components/loader/MeshGmshLoader.scn and in a new unit test.

So my question is: . Do we really need that sofa::helper::vector getSize return an _int64_ and thus we change to _size_t_ everywhere we access this method?; This means turning a lot of _int_ / _uint_ into _int64_ / _uint64_. Or do we stick to size in _int32_ ; Maybe this has not a big impact in nowadays computer? ; I'm not an expert in software memory optimization. .

In #1611 I tried to remove the hard dependency to all typeinfo and ODR violation by using the TypeInfoRegistry to get ; the typeinfo. The missing types were detected at runtime... In this version I found what is actually a much easier solution that removes the ODR violation and removes the need to typeinforegistry. . There is also two positive sides effects I see:; - in #1611 the missing types (one not having a datatype) were detected at runtime while in this one they are detected at link time with a single message like the one:; ""; undefined reference to 'sofa::core::objectmodel::Data<sofa::helper::vector<sofa::core::topology::Topology::Pyramid>::getValueTypeInfo() ; ""; - the mechanism is combined with the systematic use of declaring extern class Data<MyType>. The TypeInfo registration/generation is done where the Data<MyType> is not declared as extern.

Security,"This was preliminary introduced in SofaGLFW/SofaImgui, where a new GUI is loaded at run-time; Contrary to the batch/qt/headlessrecorder GUIs which are forcefully linked at compile-time through SofaGui, which could depend (or not) on Qt, etc according to the CMake config,. SOFANG works already made all the different GUIs as independent libraries but ultimately the SofaGui was still present because of the fact that runSofa was still relying on this mechanism. Now :; - Qt/Batch/HeadLessRecorder are loadable plugins and register themselves in the GUIManager, if loaded .; - Batch is still forcefully loaded by runSofa ; otherwise it could be possible to run SOFA without any GUI (I am not against having this possibility tho); - SofaGui is officially deprecated 🎇.

Security,"To get rid of the ""call super"" anti-pattern is very challenging, because it is used to (a) check constraints on data fields as well as to (b) initialize the internal logic of the component. The problem I see is that the two things are being interleaved in a very subtle way. And both (a) and (b) rely on the call super pattern to work.; ; That said I strongly support the idea of cleaning the data validation mechanism. . Damien,; Nota bene:; I disagree about your saying ""I think this ""true/false implying other data fields"" mechanism is a bad design and for this case no checking solution will be clean. "" . Having complex relationship between input fields is a very common situation in user interfaces and it is not restricted to""true/false implying other data fields"" but also having mutually exclusive fields and other cases. It is so common that UI frameworks have dedicated support for that (QGroupBox (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-groupbox-example.html in Qt). And from an User interface perspective not exposing such constraints to the user is actually a bad design. So, these kind of constraint are good design, the problem is on how to implement them in Sofa :) . In Sofa the current state is that:; - the constraints resulting from the type are encoded into the read method of the field (eg: RGBAColor accept inputs like #FFAABBCC or ""red"", the input validation and error message reporting is done in the 'read' field, a dynamic cast can be used to display a color selector widget instead of a text field). ; - the ""isRequired"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field and checked in BaseObject::init(); - the ""isReadOnly"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field, it is not checked in BaseObject::init() and writing to it is allowed but it used to gray out things in the GUI. ; - other constraints (including one making relation between multiple data) are encoded with if() in the overriden init() and of course these constraints are not visible in ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/754#issuecomment-416637832:398,validat,validation,398,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/754#issuecomment-416637832,1,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"We got this error many times in the past, and I never had the chance to dig into the issue. There was actually two issues:. 1. SOFA was unable to find some GL extensions on Intel drivers with the Qt viewer while they were supposed to be there (they were correctly found when using the qglviewer); 2. When no extensions at all were found by Glew, SOFA tried to convert a null pointer to a std::string, which created a segmentation fault. This PR fixes both of these issues. It first make sure that the pointer returned by Glew isn't null before converting it to a std::string. It also asks Qt to enable deprecated functions, which are used by SOFA. In addition, I've removed the part of the Qt viewer that was forcing the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` on Linux.

So, instead of writing. ```cpp; template<class T2> struct rebind; {; typedef vector< T2,CPUMemoryManager<T2> > other;; };; ```; I propose to write:; ```cpp; template<class T2>; using rebind_to = vector< T2, CPUMemoryManager<T2> >;; ```. To define `VecTriangleInfo`, we would write:. ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = typename VecCoord::template rebind_to<TriangleInfo>;; ```. IMO, it is a bit more readable. But we can do better. I introduced convenience aliases in Rebind.h. With that, I can define `VecTriangleInfo` with:; ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = sofa::type::rebind_to<VecCoord, TriangleInfo>;; ```. `sofa::type::rebind_to` works with types having a `rebind_to` typedef (such that the one I introduced in vector_T.h), or on types having one template parameter.

This PR is based on [PR #56](https://github.com/sofa-framework/Regression/pull/56) of Regression. . This PR fixes the problem of running regression tests in plugins when their references are inside of the plugin and not Regression (e.g. BeamAdapter). The idea is to have a stand alone `*.regression.tests` file that also includes the relative path of the reference folder. This is meant to be placed at the top of the reference file in a relative manne. This allows two things : ; 1. Having a stand alone file ease the process of finding the reference folder for any new comer; 2. Having a stand alone file ease the process of automatizing the retrieval of new regression test along with their reference folder without the need of modifying anything in the CI script. . Tested on my side : only two remaining regression test failing from SofaSPH. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"`SpringForceField` is updated to handle topological changes properly. It now uses callbacks.; A scene example is introduced to test topological changes on a `SpringForceField`. To make the example working, point removal was needed but not implemented. That is why I had to implement `PointSetTopologyModifier::removeItems`, and added the support of points in `TopologicalChangeProcessor`. The use of callbacks fixes the application of the topological changes in `SpringForceField`. Before the use of callbacks, the topological changes were not applied because the force field was not in the same Node than the topology. The new code also supports a change in both input topologies. Previously, changes only in the second topology were possible. Without having testing it, I think the previous code did not handle properly multiple springs connected on a single DoF.

Security,"``cmake --install``` on a freshly built Sofa repo, the header files for libQGLViewer are not properly copied to the install/include directory.; First of all the install path is too long and has at least one ${PROJECT_NAME}, i.e. ""QGLViewer"" too much in the path. Also there are header files missing which are relevant for using the provided libQGLViewer in external projects/plugins. This is caused by the now modified ```Sofa/GUI/Qt/libQGLViewer/QGLViewer/CMakeLists.txt```:; - The last argument for the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro adds too many ```/${PROJECT_NAME}``` causing the long install path (line 118); - For some reason the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro does not copy the ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` (line 21 ff.). ## Solution:; This PR shortens the output path and copies the contents of ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` to the ""normal"" ```HEADER_FILES``` which causes them to be copied to the install/include directory. This does not affect the build but ensures that all headers are copied. This was tested on Windows and two different Linux installations. I am aware that simply re-mentioning the MOC_HEADERS may look redundant, but I could not find a solution to convince the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro to also consider the MOC_HEADERS for copying. . ______________________________________________________.

Security,"a broad phase, but the code is located in its base class: `BruteForceBroadPhase`.; The narrow phase code has been extracted and put in a new component: `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`. `DirectSAP` inherits from `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`.; In the narrow phase, the result of the broad phase is used to skip the boxes which have been totally ignored in the broad phase. Initially, the `DirectSAP` component did not perform any discrimination in its broad phase. Now it performs a `BruteForceBroadPhase`. It is not yet clear if it is always a good choice regarding the performances. In the case of the caduceus scene, the performances are slightly better. I guess if the broad phase takes a lot of time (many objects), it is better to avoid it. `DirectSAP` would not be the best choice. I would use a more performant broad phase, or no broad phase, when used with `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`. From now, the user can decide to design its scene with two different ways resulting to the same behavior:; ```; <DirectSAP/>; ```; or; ```; <BruteForceBroadPhase/>; <DirectSAPNarrowPhase/>; ```; In the second option, it will be possible to change the combination of broad phase/narrow phase.; Note: I kept the component `DirectSAP`, but I don't think its name is meaningful.

Security,"and _bwd_* functions, because of the boilerplate code. In a nutshell, there are race conditions which can be avoided if the derived class can execute only the code they are designed to execute, and nothing more. ### Proposition. I added boolean variables named `applyFwd*` and `applyBwd*`, each corresponding to the `fwd*` and `bwd*` functions. They are all set to false by default.; For example, if `applyFwdMechanicalState` is true, then the code related to `fwdMechanicalState` is executed. Remember that previously, the boilerplate code related to `fwdMechanicalState` was executed even if `fwdMechanicalState` does nothing. To change that, the derived class must set the right variables to true, so the right code is executed. For example, if a derived class wants to execute `fwdMechanicalState`, it must set `applyFwdMechanicalState` first, usually in its constructor. ### Pros. - Avoid unnecessary race conditions; - Does not execute unnecessary boilerplate code; - Simple to understand. ### Cons. - Breaks all classes derived from `BaseMechanicalVisitor`; - Forces the developers of classes derived from `BaseMechanicalVisitor` to tune booleans according the goal of the visitor.; - Runtime check of the variables.

All the other scenes from the `examples/Components/linearsolver` folder have been modified so it is easy to change the resolution of the deformable beam. `totalMass` instead of `vertexMass`, and `BoxROI` instead of raw indices. In WarpPreconditioner, an additional Data is introduced to request matrix assembly at a given frequency. This is to minimize the cost of matrix assembly. Instead of assembling the matrix, the old one is used, taking into account the rotations compared to the previous time step. The same mechanism exists in ShewchukPCGLinearSolver.

Problem : this is not true, some components use vectors directly, or use Data methods / ReadAccessor / WriteAccessor not as intended (this is possible since for now some methods such as Data::endEdit do nothing) -> we would need to look at all sofa components to make sure that the Data are properly used; - To properly model the data accesses using ORWL's concepts we need to slightly modify the API of the Data class; - sofa Engine mecanisms are complex to handle using FIFOs; - it is difficult to predict the data dependencies as the Visitors are launched dynamically and can launch Visitors -> we can't predict the data accesses in a preprocessing phase, so we need to adapt ORWL.; - This approach would not induce significant performance gains on simulations with only 1 object or with 1 ""main"" object since all the computationally intensive tasks inside a given object access the same Data object (Write access) and thus are inherently sequential. **Conclusion :** the potential speedup is not good enough to invest more time on this strategy given the difficulty. **Second strategy :** finer-grain parallelization; To extract parallelism from highly data-dependent tasks we need to divide these tasks into less-dependent subtasks.; To achieve that, we are currently implementing parallel vectors to allow some kind of domain decomposit",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792:1048,access,accesses,1048,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792,2,['access'],['accesses']
Security,"e anything. It's time for refactoring!. My focus was the refactoring of the unit tests. Before the PR, a unique class tested the 3 components using a series of `if`. I refactored the 3 classes in order to reduce the specific processing in the unit test, i.e. reduce the number of `if`. - The 3 classes now inherit from a common base class `BaseLinearElasticityFEMForceField`. I moved everything that was common (only regarding the unit test. More common code is remaining) in this class. It includes:; - A common `Data` for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This way, they share type, the same default value, and the same description. Note that Young's modulus in `FastTetrahedralCorotationalForceField` and `TetrahedralCorotationalFEMForceField` was a scalar, and now it's a vector of scalars. This requires to add a common way to access the Young's modulus of the i-th element. This is also a breaking change. This allows to define a typed unit test for all 3 classes. The particularities of the classes are defined in a derived class of the unit test. To me, a great advantage, is that we identify clearly that there are unit tests for the 3 components, because there a file for each class. It was not obvious before.

So functional programming is a must (and cheap thing) to have but to be honest the syntax:; ```py; m.position[OnDiagonal] = 0.0; ```; was just there for fun and to see if it was possible (actually I see it as a generalization of the slice syntax array[2:1] that is part of the language where instead of iterating between the slice interval you can provide funny iteration scheme). But I fear how slow may be generators compared to more classical iteration mechanisms. . About your question regarding the implementation: ; I wrote most of the change using the C-python API but after some time I was fed-up on how ugly it is and terminated the implementation using python. Mixing the python and c++ code was actually very simple thanks to the cython ability to generate dual-bindings... where a c++ function is exposed in python as well as having python functions exposed to C++ (so a .h is generated to include and use the python code in your c++ code base). ; That's said cython is not magic and the generated .cpp/.h are containing 100% python C-api ...so everything implemented in cython could be implemented exactly the same using the C-python API. ; It is just 10x longer to write an equivalent code. . As you ask I pushed a branch (https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/sofa_refactorSofaPython) with the implementation don't expect the branch to compile today as it contains irrelevant code that are wip to support the buffer protocol for seamless integration with numpy. . For the syntax about Data...everything is implemented in 'Binding_Data.cpp'. ; The function SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript is the one called when using the [aaa] = operation. ; ```cpp; static int SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript(PyObject *o, PyObject *key, PyObject *value); {; ....; /// This line is actually calling the ""python"" part implementation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/767#issuecomment-419024819:1052,expose,exposed,1052,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/767#issuecomment-419024819,2,['expose'],['exposed']
Security,"easy.; 3. Add a public `Data` constructor that only initializes value, something like:; ; ``` c++; template<class T>; class Data {; public: ; Data(BaseData::no_init, const T& value = T() ) : // ...; };; ```; ; Again, easy.; 4. Provide component constructors that do not initialize their `Data` so that optimized components can be derived:; ; ``` c++; Base::Base(BaseData::no_init) : name(BaseData::no_init), //...; BaseObject::BaseObject(BaseData::no_init) : f_listening(BaseData::no_init), //... ; ; // ... BaseMapping, Mapping, etc.; ```; ; this one is tedious but not that hard. Now if all of this can be done, a derived component class will be able to manage its data on a per-class basis, and only initialize data lazily when they are actually needed (i.e. when `findData` or `getDataFields` are called). Adding/removing data would be no-ops or errors in these derived classes. ## Performance. Changing the iteration strategy incurs an extra copy of the existing `DataVec` when accessing data, but since we are likely to iterate the vector anyways there should be no visible change in; complexity. Careful allocation on the caller side should also be able to avoid most allocations during vector copy. Finally, data iteration does not seems to happen during computationally intensive sections. Should this remain an issue, it is always possible to iterate using a callback instead, which is acceptable using c++11 lambdas/`std::function`, but probably too cumbersome using c++98. **To summarize I think the performance hit for current code path is minimal.**. On the other hand, a component using `BaseData::no_init` with per-class data managemenent potentially saves up to 6 heap allocations per data per constructor call, and a fraction of this during destruction. FYI, I counted 10 `Data` members in base class `Mapping<In, Out>` alone, `collision::Contact` has 5, `ForceField` has 7,`MechanicalObject` has around 30.

Damien,; Nota bene:; I disagree about your saying ""I think this ""true/false implying other data fields"" mechanism is a bad design and for this case no checking solution will be clean. "" . Having complex relationship between input fields is a very common situation in user interfaces and it is not restricted to""true/false implying other data fields"" but also having mutually exclusive fields and other cases. It is so common that UI frameworks have dedicated support for that (QGroupBox (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-groupbox-example.html in Qt). And from an User interface perspective not exposing such constraints to the user is actually a bad design. So, these kind of constraint are good design, the problem is on how to implement them in Sofa :) . In Sofa the current state is that:; - the constraints resulting from the type are encoded into the read method of the field (eg: RGBAColor accept inputs like #FFAABBCC or ""red"", the input validation and error message reporting is done in the 'read' field, a dynamic cast can be used to display a color selector widget instead of a text field). ; - the ""isRequired"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field and checked in BaseObject::init(); - the ""isReadOnly"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field, it is not checked in BaseObject::init() and writing to it is allowed but it used to gray out things in the GUI. ; - other constraints (including one making relation between multiple data) are encoded with if() in the overriden init() and of course these constraints are not visible in the UI. ; - in some case it seems that using a common prefix in the field's name is used to group input together (I have only a vague remembering about that with drawEnable then drawColor and drawLine but I cannot find back the example).

Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`. I also cleaned the files:; - Concatenate nested namespaces; - Use `#pragma once`; - Some private and non-defined copy constructors and `operator=` are marked `delete`.; - Move methods in cpp; - Removed unnecessary `init()` implementations. They only called their base class `init()`.; - `Constraint ` has a link to the mechanical state instead of a raw pointer.; - Some constructors marked `explicit`. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"ers. . In this PR I implemented a mecanism to do that. ; The basic idea is to have in scene a component that specify for which version of Sofa the scene have been tested. Here is how it looks in the scene:; ```xml; <APIVersion level='17.06'/>; ```; If the scene does not have this component the level is automatically set to 17.06 so existing scene will just work as they should. Now what happens if a scene with a given level is loaded in a sofa that have a different level (eg: '17.12'). In this case dedicated messages are printed to warn user things may go wrong. . Here is an example of what happen when loading a scene at level '17.06' on runSofa at level '17.12' (our master branch) with a BoxStiffSpringForceField (that could behave differently because of PR #290); ```; [INFO] [SceneChecker] The 'APIVersion' directive is missing in the current scene. ; Switching to the APIVersion level '17.06' ; [INFO] [SceneChecker] Validating a scene: ; - APIVersion checking: 1 ; - RequiredPlugin checking: 1; [WARNING] [BoxStiffSpringForceField(Spring)] BoxStiffSpringForceField have changed since 17.06. To use the old behavior you need to set parameter 'forceOldBehavior=true'; ```. The nice thing with the approach is that we can write custom condition to rise those messages. Here is a simple example (to handle PR315 & an imaginary deprecation of a component):; ```cpp; addHookInChangeSet(""17.06"", [](Base* o){; if(o->getClassName() == ""RestShapeSpringsForceField"" && o->findData(""external_rest_shape"")->isSet()); msg_warning(o) << ""RestShapeSpringsForceField have changed since 17.06. The parameter 'external_rest_shape' is now a Link. To fix your scene you need to add and '@' in front of the provided path. See PR#315"" ;; }) ;. addHookInChangeSet(""17.06"", [](Base* o){; if(o->getClassName() == ""TheComponentWeWantToRemove"" ); msg_warning(o) << ""TheComponentWewantToRemove is deprecated since sofa 17.06.

Security,"ery Data that we manipulate in sofa can return type informations. ; This can be done in two ways:; - the first solution rely on type_traits with the specialization of the DataTypeInfo class. A DefaultDataTypeInfo is provided as a fallback scenario while fully defined information can be provided by providing a specialization for DataTypeInfo<>. ; - the second solution is a runtime approach were the typeinfo is inherited from AbstractTypeInfo. ; To *ease* the implementation the runtime solution is generated by ""reusing"" the static one. This is done with VirtualTypeInfo<StaticDataTypeInfo>. This VirtualTypeInfo inherits from AbstractTypeInfo but wrap and forward all the method call to the StaticDataTypeInfo passed in the template parameter. . This is actually an interesting design gears provided fast/efficient API and an abstract one with lower performance. Nevertheless there is actually one problem with the existing implementation, the problem is that by default access to the static version (so the one that need the full inclusion of involved data types) to generate the dynamic one in the VirtualTypeInfo::get() method. As this function is needed to implement Data<T>::getAbstractTypeInfo it means that the complete static version is needed everytime and everywhere we manipulate a Data<>. To be sure the code does not fall back to DefaultTypeInfo... most of the specilization are made visible in DataTypeInfo.h where a lot of data types ""vector, rigid, map, vec, quat"". All these includes are just there to insure that in Sofa no-one will never fallback on the default dehavior. But static type info is kind of ""expert"" feature that is only usefull in few rare use cases. So polluting the complete dependency tree (and compilation unit) for a rarely use case is problematic. . So I tried to reverse all to implement an opt-in solution ... by default and for most of our code base, dynamic typeinfo (aka the one following the AbstractTypeInfo interface) are available because they only",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552:1153,access,access,1153,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"getEdge() from EdgeSetTopologyContainer does bound-checking and the compiler cannot really optimize that.; EDIT: and moreover, getNbEdges() (edges, etc) used in the getEdge is extremely non-optimized... In a nutsheel, it is much faster to do; ```; const auto& edges = topo.getEdges();; for(const auto& e : edges) ; { ; blabla(e);; }; ```; than; ```; for(auto i = 0; i < topo.getNbEdges() ; i++) ; { ; blabla(topo.getEdge(i));; }; ```. Some idea to keep the getEdge() (and others) would be either to remove the bound-check (maybe enable only in debug like std::vector), or do an unsafe version. ______________________________________________________.

All these commands take an optional path argument, defaulting to the current working directory, but we could also build / develop / run any commit / tag / branch / fork of the project with eg. `nix build github:sofa-framework/sofa`(for master) or `nix run github:nim65s/sofa/58ae0644d117aea880ed284f6cc0beb7e9802f96`. While here, this also setup some CI for this packaging, mostly to detect early:; - if anything new in the repo would break the nix packaging; - if any update from a dependency in upstream [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) would break sofa. But also, a nix binary cache can be set up with eg. https://www.cachix.org/, so that once a commit is build in CI, users & developers can directly use that cache instead of compiling themselves.; (it is also true in the other way: developers with write access to the cache can send their build result to it so that the CI will be instantaneous cache hit). Here is an example of CI build log: https://github.com/nim65s/sofa/actions/runs/11306279152/job/31446709649. PS: I did not test on macos yet, so this is probably a bit early to expect it work.

More lecture for the curious: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/do-you-prefer-fast-or-precise/; fpfast enables auto-vectorisation (among other stuff), thats why they are usually enabled together. On my setup, with SOFA_ENABLE_FAST_MATH + SOFA_ENABLE_SIMD, I can get around 0 to 10% of speedup. Nothing revolutionary anyway. ; TorusFall.scn (1000steps):; - fastfp+avx2: `7.90001 s ( 126.582 FPS)`; - fastfp `8.3388 s ( 119.921 FPS)`; - avx2 `8.49847 s ( 117.668 FPS)`; - ss2 `8.56825 s ( 116.71 FPS)`; We can see that it should be either both of them enabled, or not. That's why it will not be enabled by default, except if we want fp:fast by default.

Why?; - Bothersome to need Qt to have a 3D rendering of a scene; - The existing ""simple"" GUI SofaGLUT is not supported anymore and is based on a deprecated library (glut). This PR brings a simple GUI based on GLFW (a spiritual heir of Glut).; It only needs SofaGUICommon, SofaBaseVisual and Sofa.GL as dependencies.; Integration of GLFW is automatic (automatic fetching and integration with cmake), and linked statically (does not need a glfw.dll to be shipped with). This GUI is launchable with the standard runSofa (with the parameter ""-g glfw""), or can be used with a (provided) stand-alone executable (which needs much less dependencies than runSofa). Lastly, this GUI was designed to support multiple windows in the same time and multiple simulations. So when multiple simulations is possible is the future, it should be easy to modify the code to support this feature.; And multiple windows could be based on the fact having multiple Camera in the scene (feature not implemented yet). ______________________________________________________.

Usually, a function executing on different components will access the same data vectors while executing on each component (for example MechanicalVisitor::fwdForceField, calls addForce or addDForce on each component, each one modifying the force vector).; We define a **Parallel Section** as the execution of a given visitor function on a list of components.; We define a **Task** as the execution of a visitor function on a component. Therefore a parallel section is decomposed in an ordered list of tasks.; Each task accesses a given set of vectors (read or write accesses), and a given set of locations in these vectors. We can split the tasks in **phases** such that each phase accesses a subset of the vector locations. To facilitate this, we decompose the vectors into **blocks**, and we look at the vector blocks accessed by each task phase.; Then we can have phases of different tasks that do not accesses the same locations, and so are independent and can run in parallel.; Then we model the dependencies between the tasks phases, and we use the dependency graph to schedule the parallel executions of the phases, keeping the sequential order of the operations. . All the user should have to do is to flag visitors that can be launched in parallel on the components : use a parallel version of Visitor::for_each / for_each_r to enable parallel execution of the components. **Steps performed at runtime:**. 1. Creation of « parallel visitors » using a parallel version of Visitor::for_each functions; - parallel version of for_each starts a parallel section, and creates tasks; - a task is defined as the execution of the visitor function on a component; 2.

Security,"lementation is that we wanted to access the data without abstraction cost, ie. accessing the object with its true type (eg: Data<T>) instead of its parent type (BaseData) and at the same time having an abstraction to manipulate BaseData. . Duplicating the same obect/point is in general a code smell indicating that something is wrong in the implementation. In general duplication complexify the implementation and error prone (because you have to garantee that the different copies are kept synchronized and interact together in a seamlessness way. . So, in this PR I addresse this duplication problem by removing the lowest type and relying on a dynamic_cast when it is needed. There is an abstraction cost...but it is on a on a very rarerly used method (actually only used for fast copy of data field...and in that context...the cost of the dynamic cast against one of copying millions of Dofs is totally neglectible). . A different pattern was initially used with a child-delegation to expose the abstraction to its parent but it appears it would have made the PR breaking. The difference is that the selected pattern allows one data to be parented to a data of different type while the pattern with child-delegation restrict the parenting to be of exactly the same time. . I personally prefer to have parent only on same type (so that data conversion must be added manually and becomes explicit) but this was not done previously in Sofa and thus breaks some scenes (somes of them are actually really funny....and probably work only by side effect). . ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only i",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490:1211,expose,expose,1211,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security,"llowing; ```cpp; #include <sofa/core/objectmodel/BaseObject>; bool myFunction1(BaseObject* a); {; return doSomethingWith(a);; }; ```; As we are manipulating the 'a' object via a pointer and passing it to the doSomethingWith function there is no need to know any details of the BaseObject to compile that properly. Using a forward declaration for BaseObject would save us from the inclusion of the file ```#include <sofa/core/objectmodel/BaseObject>```. Where to put forward declaration; --------------------------------------------; Forward declaration must be in a file called ```fwd.h```. The fwd.h can be located at the module root directory.; Eg:; ```; sofa/core/fwd.h; ```; If there is a lot of forward declaration it is allowed to have a per sub-module ```fwd.h``` file. ; Eg:; ```; sofa/core/objectmodel/fwd.h; sofa/core/behavior/fwd.h; ```; In that case it is mandatory that the module file contains them all. In our example ; ```cpp; sofa/core/fwd.h; #include<sofa/core/objectmodel/fwd.h>; #include<sofa/core/behavior/fwd.h>; ```. Opaque API ; =========; When it is not desirable to have access the full type definition it is possible to make or use what is called an opaque API. The Opaque API mimmics the methods provided by a class but relying only on forward declaration. ; Exemple of the ""transparent"" API: ; ```cpp; #include <Context>; #include <BaseNode>; namespace sofa::simulation; {; class Node : public Context, public BaseNode ; {; public:; double getDt(); ; ///....; };; }; ```. Exemple of the corresponding ""opaque"" API: ; ```cpp; namespace sofa::simulation::node; {; double getDt(Node*); ; }; ```. Opaque API for a given type can be located at the same location where the type is foward declared or if very long in their own dedicated file close to the one where the type definition is. ; ```; sofa/simulation/node.h; sofa/simulation/node.cpp; sofa/simulation/node-fwd.h ; ```; If the second solution is chosen, the ``node-fwd.h` file must be included by the per-module fwd.h.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1764#issuecomment-780848561:1709,access,access,1709,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1764#issuecomment-780848561,1,['access'],['access']
