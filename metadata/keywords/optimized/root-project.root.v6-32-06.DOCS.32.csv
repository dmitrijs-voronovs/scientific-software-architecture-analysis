Now, run CMake:. .. code:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang. If all goes well, you'll see a lot of ""performing test"" lines, and; finally:. .. code:: console. Configuring done; Generating done; Build files have been written to: /path/llvm-project/build. And you should see a build.ninja file. Let's break down that last command a little:. - **-G Ninja**: we're going to use ninja to build; please create; build.ninja. - **../llvm**: this is the path to the source of the ""main"" LLVM; project. - The two **-D** flags set CMake variables, which override; CMake/project defaults:. - **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release**: build in optimized mode, which is; (surprisingly) the fastest option. If you want to run under a debugger, you should use the default Debug; (which is totally unoptimized, and will lead to >10x slower test; runs) or RelWithDebInfo which is a halfway point.; **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** affects code generation only, assertions are; on by default regardless! **LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=Off** disables; them. - **LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang**: this lists the LLVM subprojects; you are interested in building, in addition to LLVM itself. Multiple; projects can be listed, separated by semicolons, such as ""clang;; lldb"".In this example, we'll be making a change to Clang, so we; should build it. Finally, create a symlink (or a copy) of; llvm-project/build/compile-commands.json into llvm-project/:. .. code:: console. $ ln -s build/compile_commands.json ../.

For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own. Typically, you will want to build your **lib** directory first followed by your; **tools** directory. Writing LLVM Style Makefiles; ============================. The LLVM build system provides a convenient way to build libraries and; executables. Most of your project Makefiles will only need to define a few; variables.

Need to unlock mu. void test() {; lockAndInit();; myObject.doSomething();; cleanupAndUnlock();; myObject.doSomething(); // Warning, mu is not locked.; }. If no argument is passed to ``ACQUIRE`` or ``RELEASE``, then the argument is; assumed to be ``this``, and the analysis will not check the body of the; function. This pattern is intended for use by classes which hide locking; details behind an abstract interface. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. template <class T>; class CAPABILITY(""mutex"") Container {; private:; Mutex mu;; T* data;. public:; // Hide mu from public interface.; void Lock() ACQUIRE() { mu.Lock(); }; void Unlock() RELEASE() { mu.Unlock(); }. T& getElem(int i) { return data[i]; }; };. void test() {; Container<int> c;; c.Lock();; int i = c.getElem(0);; c.Unlock();; }. EXCLUDES(...); -------------. *Previously*: ``LOCKS_EXCLUDED``. ``EXCLUDES`` is an attribute on functions or methods, which declares that; the caller must *not* hold the given capabilities. This annotation is; used to prevent deadlock. Many mutex implementations are not re-entrant, so; deadlock can occur if the function acquires the mutex a second time. .. code-block:: c++. Mutex mu;; int a GUARDED_BY(mu);. void clear() EXCLUDES(mu) {; mu.Lock();; a = 0;; mu.Unlock();; }. void reset() {; mu.Lock();; clear(); // Warning! Caller cannot hold 'mu'.; mu.Unlock();; }. Unlike ``REQUIRES``, ``EXCLUDES`` is optional. The analysis will not issue a; warning if the attribute is missing, which can lead to false negatives in some; cases.

Objects of the TSchemaRule class represent the rules and their fields have exactly the same; meaning as the ones of rules specified in the dictionaries. `TSchemaRuleSet` objects; manage the sets of rules and ensure their consistency. There can be no conflicting; rules in the rule sets. The rule sets are owned by the `TClass` objects corresponding to the; target classes defined in the rules and can be accessed using `TClass::{Get|Adopt}SchemaRules`. ### Manual Schema Evolution. If you have written your own `Streamer` as described in the section; ""Streamers with Special Additions"", you will have to manually add code; for each version and manage the evolution of your class. When you add or; remove data members, you must modify the `Streamer` by hand. ROOT; assumes that you have increased the class version number in the; `ClassDef` statement and introduced the relevant test in the read part; of the Streamer. For example, if a new version of the `Event` class; above includes a new member: `Int_t fNew` the `ClassDef` statement; should be changed to `ClassDef(Event,2)` and the following lines should; be added to the read part of the `Streamer`:. ``` {.cpp}; if (R__v > 1) R__b >> fNew;; else fNew = 0; // set to some default value; ```. If, in the same new version 2 you remove the member `fH`, you must add; the following code to read the histogram object into some temporary; object and delete it:. ``` {.cpp}; if (R__v) < 2 {; TH1F *dummy = 0;; R__b >> dummy;; delete dummy;; }; ```. Our experience with manual schema evolution shows that it is easy to; make and mismatches between `Streamer` writers and readers are frequent; and increase as the number of classes increase. We recommend you use; `rootcling` generated `Streamers` whenever you can, and profit from the; automatic schema evolution. ### Building Class Defini",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:83334,test,test,83334,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"arge system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/u",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:47554,test,test,47554,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments. Use of the cantFail functions should be rare in library code, but they are; likely to be of more use in tool and unit-test code where inputs and/or; mocked-up classes or functions may be known to be safe. Fallible constructors; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some classes require resource acquisition or other complex initialization that; can fail during construction. Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test. To work around; this, use the named constructor idiom and return an ``Expected<T>``:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:. static Expected<Foo> Create(Resource R1, Resource R2) {; Error Err = Error::success();; Foo F(R1, R2, Err);; if (Err); return std::move(Err);; return std::move(F);; }. private:.

Testability,"as; well as JIT compile it. While Kaleidoscope is interesting as a functional language, the fact; that it is functional makes it ""too easy"" to generate LLVM IR for it. In; particular, a functional language makes it very easy to build LLVM IR; directly in `SSA; form <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_.; Since LLVM requires that the input code be in SSA form, this is a very; nice property and it is often unclear to newcomers how to generate code; for an imperative language with mutable variables. The short (and happy) summary of this chapter is that there is no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.2; }. In this example, the loads from the G and H global variables are; explicit in the LLVM IR, and they live in the then/else branches of the; if statement (cond\_true/cond\_false).

Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account. That; means we have to convert every function part into some number, and then add it; into the hash. The lookup-up time would be small, but such an approach adds some; delay due to the hashing routine. Logarithmical search; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; We could introduce total ordering among the functions set, once ordered we; could then implement a logarithmical search. Lookup time still depends on N,; but adds a little of delay (*log(N)*). Present state; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; Both of the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower).

HLSL ASTs do not need to be compatible between DXC and Clang. We do not expect; identical code generation or that features will resemble DXC's implementation or; architecture. In fact, we explicitly expect to deviate from DXC's implementation; in key ways. Guiding Principles; ==================. This document lacks details for architectural decisions that are not yet; finalized. Our top priorities are quality, maintainability, and flexibility. In; accordance with community standards we are expecting a high level of test; coverage, and we will engineer our solutions with long term maintenance in mind.; We are also working to limit modifications to the Clang C++ code paths and; share as much functionality as possible. Architectural Direction; =======================. HLSL support in Clang is expressed as C++ minus unsupported C and C++ features.; This is different from how other Clang languages are implemented. Most languages; in Clang are additive on top of C. HLSL is not a formally or fully specified language, and while our goals require; a high level of source compatibility, implementations can vary and we have some; flexibility to be more or less permissive in some cases. For modern HLSL DXC is; the reference implementation. The HLSL effort prioritizes following similar patterns for other languages,; drivers, runtimes and targets. Specifically, We will maintain separation between; HSLS-specific code and the rest of Clang as much as possible following patterns; in use in Clang code today (i.e. ParseHL",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:1264,test,test,1264,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"ass `TFitResult`; allows access to the detailed results. Very often it is necessary to study the statistical properties of; analysis procedures. This is most easily achieved by applying the; analysis to many sets of simulated data (or ""pseudo data""), each; representing one possible version of the true experiment. If the; simulation only deals with the final distributions observed in data, and; does not perform a full simulation of the underlying physics and the; experimental apparatus, the name ""Toy Monte Carlo"" is frequently used; [^5]. Since the true values of all parameters are known in the; pseudo-data, the differences between the parameter estimates from the; analysis procedure w.r.t. the true values can be determined, and it is; also possible to check that the analysis procedure provides correct; error estimates. ## Fitting Functions to Pseudo Data ##. In the example below, a pseudo-data set is produced and a model fitted; to it. ROOT offers various minimisation algorithms to minimise a chi2 or a; negative log-likelihood function. The default minimiser is MINUIT, a; package originally implemented in the FORTRAN programming language. A; C++ version is also available, MINUIT2, as well as Fumili [@Fumili] an; algorithm optimised for fitting. The; minimisation algorithms can be selected using the static functions of; the `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions` class. Steering options for the; minimiser, such as the convergence tolerance or the maximum number of; function calls, can also be set using the methods of this class. All; currently implemented minimisers are documented in the reference; documentation of ROOT: have a look for example to the; `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` class documentation.; \newpage; The complication level of the code below is intentionally a little; higher than in the previous examples.

Testability,"assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt. Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test. A follow-up patch with code changes to the compiler will then show check-line; differences to the tests, so it is easier to see the effect of the patch.; Remove TODO/FIXME comments added in the previous step if a problem is solved. Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test.

A simple example of using FileCheck from a RUN line looks; like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llc -march=x86-64 | FileCheck %s. This syntax says to pipe the current file (""``%s``"") into ``llvm-as``, pipe; that into ``llc``, then pipe the output of ``llc`` into ``FileCheck``.

Classes that provide multiple; iterators should add a singular prefix to ``begin()`` and ``end()``; (e.g. ``global_begin()`` and ``use_begin()``). Here are some examples:. .. code-block:: c++. class VehicleMaker {; ...; Factory<Tire> F; // Avoid: a non-descriptive abbreviation.; Factory<Tire> Factory; // Better: more descriptive.; Factory<Tire> TireFactory; // Even better: if VehicleMaker has more than one; // kind of factories.; };.

Assert Liberally; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use the ""``assert``"" macro to its fullest. Check all of your preconditions and; assumptions, you never know when a bug (not necessarily even yours) might be; caught early by an assertion, which reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }.

The **lib**; directory is just a convenient place for libraries as it places them all in; a directory from which they can be linked later. **include**. This subdirectory should contain any header files that are global to your; project. By global, we mean that they are used by more than one library or; executable of your project. By placing your header files in **include**, they will be found; automatically by the LLVM build system. For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own.

Loops are rotated by the LoopRotate (:ref:`loop-rotate <passes-loop-rotate>`); pass, which converts loops into do/while style loops and is; implemented in; `LoopRotation.h <https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopRotation_8h_source.html>`_. Example:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1); // Loop body; }. is transformed to:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }. **Warning**: This transformation is valid only if the compiler; can prove that the loop body will be executed at least once. Otherwise,; it has to insert a guard which will test it at runtime. In the example; above, that would be:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; if (n > 0) {; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }; }. It's important to understand the effect of loop rotation; at the LLVM IR level. We follow with the previous examples; in LLVM IR while also providing a graphical representation; of the control-flow graphs (CFG). You can get the same graphical; results by utilizing the :ref:`view-cfg <passes-view-cfg>` pass.

There are a few categories of data in the sequence. - ``Function Records``: Function Records contain the timing of entry into and; exit from function execution. Function Records have 8 bytes each. - ``Metadata Records``: Metadata records serve many purposes. Mostly, they; capture information that may be too costly to record for each function, but; that is required to contextualize the fine-grained timings. They also are used; as markers for user-defined Event Data payloads. Metadata records have 16; bytes each. - ``Event Data``: Free form data may be associated with events that are traced; by the binary and encode data defined by a handler function. Event data is; always preceded with a marker record which indicates how large it is. - ``Function Arguments``: The arguments to some functions are included in the; trace. These are either pointer addresses or primitives that are read and; logged independently of their types in a high level language. To the tracer,; they are all numbers. Function Records that have attached arguments will; indicate their presence on the function entry record. We only support logging; contiguous function argument sequences starting with argument zero, which will; be the ""this"" pointer for member function invocations.

A constant of a :ref:`single value <t_single_value>`, non-vector type is well; defined if it is neither '``undef``' constant nor '``poison``' constant.; The result of :ref:`freeze instruction <i_freeze>` is well defined regardless; of its operand. .. _blockaddress:. Addresses of Basic Blocks; -------------------------. ``blockaddress(@function, %block)``. The '``blockaddress``' constant computes the address of the specified; basic block in the specified function. It always has an ``ptr addrspace(P)`` type, where ``P`` is the address space; of the function containing ``%block`` (usually ``addrspace(0)``). Taking the address of the entry block is illegal. This value only has defined behavior when used as an operand to the; ':ref:`indirectbr <i_indirectbr>`' or for comparisons against null. Pointer; equality tests between labels addresses results in undefined behavior ---; though, again, comparison against null is ok, and no label is equal to the null; pointer. This may be passed around as an opaque pointer sized value as long as; the bits are not inspected. This allows ``ptrtoint`` and arithmetic to be; performed on these values so long as the original value is reconstituted before; the ``indirectbr`` instruction. Finally, some targets may provide defined semantics when using the value; as the operand to an inline assembly, but that is target specific. .. _dso_local_equivalent:.

A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit.

A numeric variable can also be defined to the result of a numeric expression,; in which case the numeric expression constraint is checked and if verified the; variable is assigned to the value. The unified syntax for both checking a; numeric expression and capturing its value into a numeric variable is thus; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>: <constraint> <expr>]]`` with each element as; described previously. One can use this syntax to make a testcase more; self-describing by using variables instead of values:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG_OFFSET:]], 0x[[#%X,FIELD_OFFSET:12]]; ; CHECK-NEXT: load r[[#]], [r[[#REG_BASE:]], r[[#REG_OFFSET]]]. which would match:. .. code-block:: gas. mov r4, 0xC; load r6, [r5, r4].

For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2. And the checks are different:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; SSE2: @test1; ; SSE2: psubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0; ; AVX1: @test1; ; AVX1: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0; ; AVX2: @test1; ; AVX2: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0. So, if you're testing for a behaviour that you know is platform-specific or; depends on special features of sub-architectures, you must add the specific; triple, test with the specific FileCheck and put it into the specific; directory that will filter out all other architectures. Constraining test execution; ---------------------------. Some tests can be run only in specific configurations, such as; with debug builds or on particular platforms. Use ``REQUIRES``; and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to control when the test is enabled. Some tests are expected to fail. For example, there may be a known bug; that the test detect. Use ``XFAIL`` to mark a test as an expected failure.; An ``XFAIL`` test will be successful if its execution fails, and; will be a failure if its execution succeeds. .. code-block:: llvm. ; This test will be only enabled in the build with asserts.; ; REQUIRES: asserts; ; This test is disabled when running on Linux.; ; UNSUPPORTED: system-linux; ; This test is expected to fail when targeting PowerPC.; ; XFAIL: target=powerpc{{.*}}. ``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL`` all accept a comma-separated; list of boolean expressions.

Testability,"ation option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```.

Otherwise,; it has to insert a guard which will test it at runtime. In the example; above, that would be:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; if (n > 0) {; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }; }. It's important to understand the effect of loop rotation; at the LLVM IR level. We follow with the previous examples; in LLVM IR while also providing a graphical representation; of the control-flow graphs (CFG). You can get the same graphical; results by utilizing the :ref:`view-cfg <passes-view-cfg>` pass.

Clang provides a mechanism by which frameworks can be built in such a way that; they will always be treated as being ""system frameworks"", even if they are not; present in a system framework directory. This can be useful to system; framework developers who want to be able to test building other applications; with development builds of their framework, including the manner in which the; compiler changes warning behavior for system headers. Framework developers can opt-in to this mechanism by creating a; ""``.system_framework``"" file at the top-level of their framework. That is, the; framework should have contents like:. .. code-block:: none. .../TestFramework.framework; .../TestFramework.framework/.system_framework; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers/TestFramework.h; ... Clang will treat the presence of this file as an indicator that the framework; should be treated as a system framework, regardless of how it was found in the; framework search path. For consistency, we recommend that such files never be; included in installed versions of the framework. Checks for Standard Language Features; =====================================. The ``__has_feature`` macro can be used to query if certain standard language; features are enabled. The ``__has_extension`` macro can be used to query if; language features are available as an extension when compiling for a standard; which does not provide them.

Nearly all of these variable names begin with; ``LLVM_``. **BUILD_SHARED_LIBS**:BOOL; Flag indicating if each LLVM component (e.g. Support) is built as a shared; library (ON) or as a static library (OFF). Its default value is OFF. On; Windows, shared libraries may be used when building with MinGW, including; mingw-w64, but not when building with the Microsoft toolchain. .. note:: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is only recommended for use by LLVM developers.; If you want to build LLVM as a shared library, you should use the; ``LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB`` option. **LLVM_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS**:STRING; Used to decide if LLVM should be built with ABI breaking checks or; not. Allowed values are `WITH_ASSERTS` (default), `FORCE_ON` and; `FORCE_OFF`. `WITH_ASSERTS` turns on ABI breaking checks in an; assertion enabled build. `FORCE_ON` (`FORCE_OFF`) turns them on; (off) irrespective of whether normal (`NDEBUG`-based) assertions are; enabled or not.

If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries. This; option should not be used if your distribution includes static archives, as the; objects inside the archive will be LLVM bitcode, which is not portable. The :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` documentation describes the built-in tooling for; generating LLVM profiling information to drive Profile-Guided-Optimization. The; in-tree profiling tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files.

Testability,"base offset). The ``RelocationType`` enum; for that target is defined in the short target-specific ``XXXRelocations.h``; file. The ``RelocationType`` is used by the ``relocate`` method defined in; ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` to rewrite addresses for referenced global symbols. For example, ``X86Relocations.h`` specifies the following relocation types for; the X86 addresses. In all four cases, the relocated value is added to the; value already in memory. For ``reloc_pcrel_word`` and ``reloc_picrel_word``,; there is an additional initial adjustment. .. code-block:: c++. enum RelocationType {; reloc_pcrel_word = 0, // add reloc value after adjusting for the PC loc; reloc_picrel_word = 1, // add reloc value after adjusting for the PIC base; reloc_absolute_word = 2, // absolute relocation; no additional adjustment; reloc_absolute_dword = 3 // absolute relocation; no additional adjustment; };. Target JIT Info; ---------------. ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` implements the JIT interfaces for target-specific; code-generation activities, such as emitting machine code and stubs. At; minimum, a target-specific version of ``XXXJITInfo`` implements the following:. * ``getLazyResolverFunction`` --- Initializes the JIT, gives the target a; function that is used for compilation. * ``emitFunctionStub`` --- Returns a native function with a specified address; for a callback function. * ``relocate`` --- Changes the addresses of referenced globals, based on; relocation types. * Callback function that are wrappers to a function stub that is used when the; real target is not initially known. ``getLazyResolverFunction`` is generally trivial to implement. It makes the; incoming parameter as the global ``JITCompilerFunction`` and returns the; callback function that will be used a function wrapper.

The first; pair item describes the path to a submodule in the umbrella; repository. The second pair item describes the path where trees for; that submodule should be written in the zipped history. Let's say your umbrella repository is actually the llvm repository and; it has submodules in the ""nested sources"" layout (clang in; tools/clang, etc.). Let's also say ``projects/myproj`` is a submodule; pointing to some downstream repository.

Please refer to `the following instructions; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#build-instructions>`_; for more details. Clang will expect the ``llvm-spirv`` executable to; be present in the ``PATH`` environment variable. Clang uses ``llvm-spirv``; with `the widely adopted assembly syntax package; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/#build-with-spirv-tools>`_. `The versioning; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/releases>`_ of; ``llvm-spirv`` is aligned with Clang major releases. The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases.

A, 16, A; B, 16, A; , , B; C, 16, C; D, 16, A; , , D; , 48, C. The next step is to encode this compatibility information into the IR. The way; this is done is to create type metadata named after each of the compatible; classes, with which we associate each of the compatible address points in; each vtable. For example, these type metadata entries encode the compatibility; information for the above hierarchy:. ::. @_ZTV1A = constant [...], !type !0; @_ZTV1B = constant [...], !type !0, !type !1; @_ZTV1C = constant [...], !type !2; @_ZTV1D = constant [...], !type !0, !type !3, !type !4. !0 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1A""}; !1 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1B""}; !2 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1C""}; !3 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1D""}; !4 = !{i64 48, !""_ZTS1C""}. With this type metadata, we can now use the ``llvm.type.test`` intrinsic to; test whether a given pointer is compatible with a type identifier. Working; backwards, if ``llvm.type.test`` returns true for a particular pointer,; we can also statically determine the identities of the virtual functions; that a particular virtual call may call. For example, if a program assumes; a pointer to be a member of ``!""_ZST1A""``, we know that the address can; be only be one of ``_ZTV1A+16``, ``_ZTV1B+16`` or ``_ZTV1D+16`` (i.e. the; address points of the vtables of A, B and D respectively). If we then load; an address from that pointer, we know that the address can only be one of; ``&A::f``, ``&B::f`` or ``&D::f``. .. _address point: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#vtable-general.

The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``. We can also go further still, as many of GlobalISel's passes are readily unit; testable:. .. image:: testing-unit-level.png. It's possible to create an imaginary target such as in `LegalizerHelperTest.cpp <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/93b29d3882baf7df42e4e9bc26b977b00373ef56/llvm/unittests/CodeGen/GlobalISel/LegalizerHelperTest.cpp#L28-L57>`_; and perform a single step of the algorithm and check the result. The MIR and; FileCheck directives can be embedded using strings so you still have access to; the convenience available in llvm-lit. Debugging; ---------. One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png.

This backend is going to generate SQL queries. The general form of a SQL query is:; ```; SELECT <some field names> FROM <table name>; WHERE <conditions>; ORDER BY <field tags>;; ```. ## SQL Query TableGen. ```python; query_tblgen = """"""\; def all;; def fields;; def none;. def eq;; def ne;; def gt;; def ge;; def and;; def or;; """"""; ```. Normally you'd write this to a `.td` file but here we have it in a Python string to fit into this notebook. We will add to this string to produce the final source. This section defines some constants. First are the fields we want to get back from the query:; * `all` - Return all fields.; * `fields` - Means that we will provide a list of fields we are interested in. The second set are the logical operators for what will become the `WHERE` clause (called `condition` in the TableGen). These are string versions of various symbols. For example `ne` means `!=`, which in SQL is `<>`. Finally `none` is used to mean there is no condition to the query (no `WHERE`). ```python; query_tblgen += """"""\; class Query <string table, dag query_fields = (all), dag condition = (none)> {; string TableName = table;; dag Fields = query_fields;; dag WhereClause = condition;; list<string> OrderedBy = [];; }; """"""; ```. Then the Query class. Its arguments are:; * `table` - The name of the table to query (`FROM <table>`).; * `query_fields` - The fields you want returned (`SELECT <fields>`).; * Defaults to `all` meaning return all fields.; * `condition` - Logic to select entries (`WHERE <conditions>`).; * Defaults to `none` meaning there is no condition, or in other words select all entries in the table. ## Using The Query Class. ```python; full_tblgen = query_tblgen + """"""\; def : Query<""Customer"">;. def : Query<""Orders"", (fields ""Per",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md:3236,log,logical,3236,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md,1,['log'],['logical']
Testability,"bling and positioning volumes. If we define now `C` as an assembly containing `A` and `B`, positioning; the assembly into `D,E` and `F` will actually position only `A` and; `B `directly into these volumes, taking into account their combined; transformations `A/B` to `C` and `C` to `D/E/F`. This looks much nicer,; is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of; the ‘unnecessary' volume `C` in our geometry, but we end-up with a more; flat structure for `D,E` and `F` (more daughters inside). This can get; much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of; assemblies. For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or; assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both cases, after the; geometry was closed:. ``` {.cpp}; gGeoManager->SetTopVolume(ptr_D);; gGeoManager->Test();; gGeoManager->RestoreMasterVolume();; ```. The `ptr_D` is a pointer to volume `D` containing the interesting; structure. The test will provide the timing for classifying 1 million; random points inside `D`. #### Examples of Volume Positioning. Now let us make a simple volume representing a copper wire. We suppose; that a medium is already created (see **`TGeoMedium`** class on how to; create media). We will create a `TUBE` shape for our wire, having `Rmin=0cm`,; `Rmax=0.01cm` and a half-length `dZ=1cm`:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoTube *tube = new TGeoTube(""wire_tube"",0,0.01,1);; ```. One may omit the name for the shape `wire_tube,` if no retrieving by; name is further needed during geometry building. Different volumes; having different names and materials can share the same shape. Now let's make the volume for our wire:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoVolume *wire_co = new TGeoVolume(""WIRE_CO"",tube,; ptrCOPPER); //(*); ```. **(\*)** Do not bother to delete the media, shapes or volumes that you; have created since all will be automatically cleaned on exit by the; manager class.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. **bugpoint** narrows down the source of problems in LLVM tools and passes. It; can be used to debug three types of failures: optimizer crashes, miscompilations; by optimizers, or bad native code generation (including problems in the static; and JIT compilers). It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For more information on the design and inner workings of **bugpoint**, as well as; advice for using bugpoint, see :doc:`/Bugpoint` in the LLVM; distribution. OPTIONS; -------. **--additional-so** *library*. Load the dynamic shared object *library* into the test program whenever it is; run. This is useful if you are debugging programs which depend on non-LLVM; libraries (such as the X or curses libraries) to run. **--append-exit-code**\ =\ *{true,false}*. Append the test programs exit code to the output file so that a change in exit; code is considered a test failure. Defaults to false. **--args** *program args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--args** to the test program whenever it runs.; Note that if any of the *program args* start with a ""``-``"", you should use:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --args -- [program args]. The ""``--``"" right after the **--args** option tells **bugpoint** to consider; any options starting with ""``-``"" to be part of the **--args** option, not as; options to **bugpoint** itself. **--tool-args** *tool args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--tool-args** to the LLVM tool under test; (**llc**, **lli**, etc.) whenever it runs.

See; [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_FLAGS.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_FLAGS.html). - `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`. Select the C compiler executable to be used. Note that the C++ compiler is; inferred automatically i.e. when specifying `path/to/clang` CMake will; automatically use `path/to/clang++` as the C++ compiler. See; [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html). - `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER`. Select the Fortran compiler executable to be used. Not set by default and not; required unless running the Fortran Test Suite. - `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. Select a build type like `OPTIMIZE` or `DEBUG` selecting a set of predefined; compiler flags. These flags are applied regardless of the `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`; option and may be changed by modifying `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_OPTIMIZE` etc. See; [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html). - `TEST_SUITE_FORTRAN`. Activate that Fortran tests. This is a work in progress. More information can be; found in the [Flang documentation](https://flang.llvm.org/docs/FortranLLVMTestSuite.html). - `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER`. Prefix test invocations with the given tool. This is typically used to run; cross-compiled tests within a simulator tool. - `TEST_SUITE_BENCHMARKING_ONLY`. Disable tests that are unsuitable for performance measurements. The disabled; tests either run for a very short time or are dominated by I/O performance; making them unsuitable as compiler perfor,MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md:4827,Test,Test,4827,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md,1,['Test'],['Test']
Testability,"builtins can be built with ``ninja builtins``. Testing compiler-rt builtins using qemu-arm; ===========================================; To test the builtins library we need to add a few more cmake flags to enable; testing and set up the compiler and flags for test case. We must also tell; cmake that we wish to run the tests on ``qemu-arm``. * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_EMULATOR=""qemu-arm -L /path/to/armhf/sysroot``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER=""/path/to/clang""``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER_CFLAGS=""test-c-flags""``. The ``/path/to/armhf/sysroot`` should be the same as the one passed to; ``--sysroot`` in the ""build-c-flags"". The ""test-c-flags"" need to include the target, architecture, gcc-toolchain,; sysroot and arm/thumb state. The additional cmake defines such as; ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` do not apply when building the tests. If; you have put all of these in ""build-c-flags"" then these can be repeated. If you; wish to use lld to link the tests then add ``""-fuse-ld=lld``. Once cmake has completed the tests can be built and run using; ``ninja check-builtins``. Troubleshooting; ===============. The cmake try compile stage fails; ---------------------------------; At an early stage cmake will attempt to compile and link a simple C program to; test if the toolchain is working. This stage can often fail at link time if the ``--sysroot=`` and; ``--gcc-toolchain=`` options are not passed to the compiler. Check the; ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET`` flags. It can be useful to build a simple example outside of cmake with your toolchain; to make sure it is working. For example: ``clang --target=arm-linux-gnueabi -march=armv7a --gcc-toolchain=/path/to/gcc-toolchain --sysroot=/path/to/gcc-toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc helloworld.c``.

The ``-oop-executor[=/path/to/executor]`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; execute the given executor (which defaults to ``llvm-jitlink-executor``) and; communicate with it via file descriptors which it passes to the executor; as the first argument with the format ``filedescs=<in-fd>,<out-fd>``. The ``-oop-executor-connect=<host>:<port>`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; connect to an already running executor via TCP on the given host and port. To; use this option you will need to start ``llvm-jitlink-executor`` manually with; ``listen=<host>:<port>`` as the first argument. Harness mode; ------------. The ``-harness`` option allows a set of input objects to be designated as a test; harness, with the regular object files implicitly treated as objects to be; tested. Definitions of symbols in the harness set override definitions in the; test set, and external references from the harness cause automatic scope; promotion of local symbols in the test set (these modifications to the usual; linker rules are accomplished via an ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin`` installed by; ``llvm-jitlink`` when it sees the ``-harness`` option). With these modifications in place we can selectively test functions in an object; file by mocking those function's callees. For example, suppose we have an object; file, ``test_code.o``, compiled from the following C source (which we need not; have access to):. .. code-block:: c. void irrelevant_function() { irrelevant_external(); }. int function_to_mock(int X) {; return /* some function of X */;; }. static void function_to_test() {; ...; int Y = function_to_mock();; printf(""Y is %i\n"", Y);; }.

Testability,"by ``-fms-extensions``. Third, MSVC accepts some C++ code that Clang will typically diagnose as; invalid. When these constructs are present in widely included system headers,; Clang attempts to recover and continue compiling the user's program. Most; parsing and semantic compatibility tweaks are controlled by; ``-fms-compatibility`` and ``-fdelayed-template-parsing``, and they are a work; in progress. Finally, there is :ref:`clang-cl`, a driver program for clang that attempts to; be compatible with MSVC's cl.exe. ABI features; ============. The status of major ABI-impacting C++ features:. * Record layout: :good:`Complete`. We've tested this with a fuzzer and have; fixed all known bugs. * Class inheritance: :good:`Mostly complete`. This covers all of the standard; OO features you would expect: virtual method inheritance, multiple; inheritance, and virtual inheritance. Every so often we uncover a bug where; our tables are incompatible, but this is pretty well in hand. This feature; has also been fuzz tested. * Name mangling: :good:`Ongoing`. Every new C++ feature generally needs its own; mangling. For example, member pointer template arguments have an interesting; and distinct mangling. Fortunately, incorrect manglings usually do not result; in runtime errors. Non-inline functions with incorrect manglings usually; result in link errors, which are relatively easy to diagnose. Incorrect; manglings for inline functions and templates result in multiple copies in the; final image. The C++ standard requires that those addresses be equal, but few; programs rely on this. * Member pointers: :good:`Mostly complete`. Standard C++ member pointers are; fully implemented and should be ABI compatible. Both `#pragma; pointers_to_members`_ and the `/vm`_ flags are supported. However, MSVC; supports an extension to allow creating a `pointer to a member of a virtual; base class`_. Clang does not yet support this. .. _#pragma pointers_to_members:; https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst:1994,test,tested,1994,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"c needs (e.g. your compiler is meant to compile a large browser; for four different platforms, or similar), you may want to do something else.; This is configurable in the script itself. Building Clang with PGO; =======================. If you prefer to not use the script or the cmake cache, this briefly goes over; how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO. First, you should have at least LLVM, Clang, and compiler-rt checked out; locally. Next, at a high level, you're going to need to do the following:. 1. Build a standard Release Clang and the relevant libclang_rt.profile library; 2. Build Clang using the Clang you built above, but with instrumentation; 3. Use the instrumented Clang to generate profiles, which consists of two steps:. - Running the instrumented Clang/LLVM/lld/etc. on tasks that represent how; users will use said tools.; - Using a tool to convert the ""raw"" profiles generated above into a single,; final PGO profile. 4. Build a final release Clang (along with whatever other binaries you need); using the profile collected from your benchmark. In more detailed steps:. 1. Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires).",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst:3642,benchmark,benchmark,3642,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']
Testability,"c or obj directory.]. #. You can now run the test suite from your build tree as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT/projects/test-suite; % make. Note that the second and third steps only need to be done once. After; you have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it; again (unless the test code or configure script changes). Configuring External Tests; ==========================. In order to run the External tests in the ``test-suite`` module, you; must specify *--with-externals*. This must be done during the; *re-configuration* step (see above), and the ``llvm`` re-configuration; must recognize the previously-built ``llvm-gcc``. If any of these is; missing or neglected, the External tests won't work. * *--with-externals*. * *--with-externals=<directory>*. This tells LLVM where to find any external tests. They are expected to; be in specifically named subdirectories of <``directory``>. If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group.

MIR is a human readable serialization format that is used to represent; LLVM's :ref:`machine specific intermediate representation; <machine code representation>`. The MIR serialization format is designed to be used for testing the code; generation passes in LLVM. Overview; ========. The MIR serialization format uses a YAML container. YAML is a standard; data serialization language, and the full YAML language spec can be read at; `yaml.org; <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction>`_. A MIR file is split up into a series of `YAML documents`_. The first document; can contain an optional embedded LLVM IR module, and the rest of the documents; contain the serialized machine functions. .. _YAML documents: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132. MIR Testing Guide; =================. You can use the MIR format for testing in two different ways:. - You can write MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:1145,test,testing,1145,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"cases as well - just start an RFC thread on the; `LLVM Discourse forums`_. Adding a New Target; -------------------. LLVM is very receptive to new targets, even experimental ones, but a number of; problems can appear when adding new large portions of code, and back-ends are; normally added in bulk. New targets need the same level of support as other; *core* parts of the compiler, so they are covered in the *core tier* of our; :doc:`support policy<SupportPolicy>`. We have found that landing large pieces of new code and then trying to fix; emergent problems in-tree is problematic for a variety of reasons. For these; reasons, new targets are *always* added as *experimental* until they can be; proven stable, and later moved to non-experimental. The differences between both classes are:. * Experimental targets are not built by default (they need to be explicitly; enabled at CMake time). * Test failures, bugs, and build breakages that only appear when the; experimental target is enabled, caused by changes unrelated to the target, are; the responsibility of the community behind the target to fix. The basic rules for a back-end to be upstreamed in **experimental** mode are:. * Every target must have a :ref:`code owner<code owners>`. The `CODE_OWNERS.TXT`; file has to be updated as part of the first merge. The code owner makes sure; that changes to the target get reviewed and steers the overall effort. * There must be an active community behind the target. This community; will help maintain the target by providing buildbots, fixing; bugs, answering the LLVM community's questions and making sure the new; target doesn't break any of the other targets, or generic code. This; behavior is expected to continue throughout the lifetime of the; target's code. * The code must be free of contentious issues, for example, large; changes in how the IR behaves or should be formed by the front-ends,; unless agreed by the majority of the community via refactoring of the; (:doc:`IR standard<L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:39516,Test,Test,39516,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['Test'],['Test']

Clang allows C++-style ``[[]]`` attributes to be written on using-declarations.; For instance:. .. code-block:: c++.

This can be useful to system; framework developers who want to be able to test building other applications; with development builds of their framework, including the manner in which the; compiler changes warning behavior for system headers.

As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases. See; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for examples. * `trackAssignments` doesn't yet work for variables that have their; `llvm.dbg.declare` location modified by a `DIExpression`, e.g. when the; address of the variable is itself stored in an `alloca` with the; `llvm.dbg.declare` using `DIExpression(DW_OP_deref)`. See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment. To solve; this we probably need another marker intrinsic to denote ""the variable's; stack home is X address"" - similar to `llvm.dbg.declare` except that it needs; to compose with `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics such that the stack home address; is only selected as a location for the variable when the `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics agree it should be. * Given the above (a special ""the stack home is X"" intrinsic), and the fact; that we can only track assignments with fixed offsets and sizes, I think we; can probably get rid of the address and address-expression pa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:10284,test,test,10284,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ce. ## Overview. The development of ROOT almost exclusively happens using the [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests); model of github. A pull request (PR) should contain a set focused changes; organized in one or more [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Revision_control).; PRs should be well-documented and well-tested in order to allow other community; members to use, maintain and modify. If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; However, we disallow error m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/DEVELOPMENT.md:989,test,tests,989,README/DEVELOPMENT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/DEVELOPMENT.md,2,['test'],"['tested', 'tests']"

This can be used to only; build parts of the test-suite or to include external suites. This option; does not work reliably with deeper subdirectories as it skips intermediate; `CMakeLists.txt` files which may be required. - `TEST_SUITE_COLLECT_STATS`. Collect internal LLVM statistics. Appends `-save-stats=obj` when invoking the; compiler and makes the lit runner collect and merge the statistic files. - `TEST_SUITE_RUN_BENCHMARKS`. If this is set to `OFF` then lit will not actually run the tests but just; collect build statistics like compile time and code size. - `TEST_SUITE_USE_PERF`.

The `perf` is usually available on linux systems. - `TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT`, `TEST_SUITE_SPEC2006_ROOT`, `TEST_SUITE_SPEC2017_ROOT`, ...

Testability,"ceptions; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/LICENSE.TXT>`_. Can I modify the LLVM source code and redistribute binaries or other tools based on it, without redistributing the source?; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; Yes. This is why we distribute LLVM under a less restrictive license than GPL,; as explained in the first question above. Source Code; ===========. In what language is LLVM written?; ---------------------------------; All of the LLVM tools and libraries are written in C++ with extensive use of; the STL. How portable is the LLVM source code?; -------------------------------------; The LLVM source code should be portable to most modern Unix-like operating; systems. LLVM also has excellent support on Windows systems.; Most of the code is written in standard C++ with operating system; services abstracted to a support library. The tools required to build and; test LLVM have been ported to a plethora of platforms. What API do I use to store a value to one of the virtual registers in LLVM IR's SSA representation?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. In short: you can't. It's actually kind of a silly question once you grok; what's going on. Basically, in code like:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = add i32 %foo, %bar. , ``%result`` is just a name given to the ``Value`` of the ``add``; instruction. In other words, ``%result`` *is* the add instruction. The; ""assignment"" doesn't explicitly ""store"" anything to any ""virtual register"";; the ""``=``"" is more like the mathematical sense of equality. Longer explanation: In order to generate a textual representation of the; IR, some kind of name has to be given to each instruction so that other; instructions can textually reference it. However, the isomorphic in-memory; representation that you manipulate from C++ has no such restriction since; instruc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst:1417,test,test,1417,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst,1,['test'],['test']

To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again. In the above example,; setting the limit to 1 will thus cause lit to report an error instead of; producing incorrect output. Options; -------. The llvm lit configuration allows to customize some things with user options:. ``llc``, ``opt``, ...; Substitute the respective llvm tool name with a custom command line. This; allows to specify custom paths and default arguments for these tools.; Example:. % llvm-lit ""-Dllc=llc -verify-machineinstrs"". ``run_long_tests``; Enable the execution of long running tests. ``llvm_site_config``; Load the specified lit configuration instead of the default one. Other Features; --------------. To make RUN line writing easier, there are several helper programs. These; helpers are in the PATH when running tests, so you can just call them using; their name. For example:. ``not``; This program runs its arguments and then inverts the result code from it.; Zero result codes become 1. Non-zero result codes become 0. To make the output more useful, :program:`lit` will scan; the lines of the test case for ones that contain a pattern that matches; ``PR[0-9]+``. This is the syntax for specifying a PR (Problem Report) number; that is related to the test case. The number after ""PR"" specifies the; LLVM Bugzilla number. When a PR number is specified, it will be used in; the pass/fail reporting. This is useful to quickly get some context when; a test fails. Finally, any line that contains ""END."" will cause the special; interpretation of lines to terminate. This is generally done right after; the last RUN: line. This has two side effects:.

The `RooFit::TestStatistics` namespace contains a major refactoring of the `RooAbsTestStatistic`-`RooAbsOptTestStatistic`-`RooNLLVar` inheritance tree into:. 1. statistics-based classes on the one hand;; 2. calculation/evaluation/optimization based classes on the other hand. The main selling point of using `RooFit::TestStatistics` from a performance point of view is the implementation of the `RooFit::MultiProcess` based `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculator class.; To use it to perform a ""migrad"" fit (using Minuit2), one should create a `RooMinimizer` using a new constructor with a `RooAbsL` likelihood parameter as follows:. ```c++; using RooFit::TestStatistics::RooAbsL;; using RooFit::TestStatistics::buildLikelihood;. RooAbsPdf* pdf = ...; // build a pdf; RooAbsData* data = ...; // get some data. std::shared_ptr<RooAbsL> likelihood = buildLikelihood(pdf, data, [OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS]);. RooMinimizer m(likelihood);; m.migrad();; ```. The `RooMinimizer` object behaves as usual, except that behind the scenes it will now calculate each partial derivative on a separate process, ideally running on a separate CPU core.; This can be used to speed up fits with many parameters (at least as many as there are cores to parallelize over), since every parameter corresponds to a partial derivative.; The resulting fit parameters will be identical to those obtained with the non-parallelized gradients minimizer in most cases (see the usage notes linked below for exceptions). In upcoming releases, further developments are planned:. - Benchmark/profile and optimize performance further; - Add a `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` interface around these new classes; - Achieve feature parity wi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:17321,Test,TestStatistics,17321,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,2,['Test'],['TestStatistics']

Testability,"cial policy on how one gets elected to be a code owner. .. _include a testcase:. Test Cases; ----------. Developers are required to create test cases for any bugs fixed and any new; features added. Some tips for getting your testcase approved:. * All feature and regression test cases are added to the ``llvm/test``; directory. The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the; :doc:`Testing Guide <TestingGuide>` for details). * Test cases should be written in :doc:`LLVM assembly language <LangRef>`. * Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,; by :doc:`bugpoint <Bugpoint>` or manually. It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links. Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature; tests only. More extensive test cases (e.g., entire applications, benchmarks,; etc) should be added to the ``llvm-test`` test suite. The llvm-test suite is; for coverage (correctness, performance, etc) testing, not feature or regression; testing. Release Notes; -------------. Many projects in LLVM communicate important changes to users through release; notes, typically found in ``docs/ReleaseNotes.rst`` for the project. Changes to; a project that are user-facing, or that users may wish to know about, should be; added to the project's release notes at the author's or code reviewer's; discretion, preferably as part of the commit landing the changes. Examples of; changes that would typically warrant adding a release note (this list is not; exhaustive):. * Adding, removing, or modifying command-line options.; * Adding, removing, or regrouping a diagnostic.; * Fixin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:10404,test,test,10404,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Based on what type of bug it is, follow the instructions in the; linked section to narrow down the bug so that the person who fixes it will be; able to find the problem more easily. Once you have a reduced test-case, go to `the LLVM Bug Tracking System; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_ and fill out the form with the; necessary details (note that you don't need to pick a label, just use if you're; not sure).

To figure out which component is crashing (the front-end, middle-end; optimizer, or backend code generator), run the ``clang`` command line as you; were when the crash occurred, but with the following extra command line; options:. * ``-emit-llvm -Xclang -disable-llvm-passes``: If ``clang`` still crashes when; passed these options (which disable the optimizer and code generator), then; the crash is in the front-end. Jump ahead to :ref:`front-end bugs; <frontend-crash>`. * ``-emit-llvm``: If ``clang`` crashes with this option (which disables; the code generator), you found a middle-end optimizer bug.

Testability,"ck all of your preconditions and; assumptions, you never know when a bug (not necessarily even yours) might be; caught early by an assertion, which reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch.

You can test for support for this extension with; ``__has_extension(cxx_attributes_on_using_declarations)``. 'User-Specified' System Frameworks; ==================================. Clang provides a mechanism by which frameworks can be built in such a way that; they will always be treated as being ""system frameworks"", even if they are not; present in a system framework directory. This can be useful to system; framework developers who want to be able to test building other applications; with development builds of their framework, including the manner in which the; compiler changes warning behavior for system headers. Framework developers can opt-in to this mechanism by creating a; ""``.system_framework``"" file at the top-level of their framework. That is, the; framework should have contents like:. .. code-block:: none. .../TestFramework.framework; .../TestFramework.framework/.system_framework; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers; .../TestFramework.framework/Headers/TestFramework.h; ... Clang will treat the presence of this file as an indicator that the framework; should be treated as a system framework, regardless of how it was found in the; framework search path. For consistency, we recommend that such files never be; included in installed versions of the framework. Checks for Standard Language Features; =====================================. The ``__has_feature`` macro can be used to query if certain standard language; features are enabled. The ``__has_extension`` macro can be used to query if; language features are available as an extension when compiling for a standard; which does not provide them. The features which can be tested are listed here. Since Clang 3.4, the C++ SD-6 feature test macros are also supported.; These are macros with names of the form ``__cpp_<feature_name>``, and are; intended to be a portable way to query the supported features of the compiler.; See `the C++",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:38213,Test,TestFramework,38213,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['Test'],['TestFramework']

These classes are the`ROOT::Fit::BinData`for describing bin data sets,; 	 thus data points containing both coordinates and a corresponding value/weight; 	 with optionally an error on the value or the coordinate and the `ROOT::Fit::UnBinData` for un-binned data sets,; 	 which consists only of a vector of coordinate values.

Testability,"cluded by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:46232,assert,asserts,46232,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['assert'],['asserts']

A pull request (PR) should contain a set focused changes; organized in one or more [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Revision_control).; PRs should be well-documented and well-tested in order to allow other community; members to use, maintain and modify. If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}; int C = D; // bar-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'D'}}; int E = F; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'F'}}. The verifier will recognize ``foo-error`` and ``bar-error`` as special comments; but will not recognize ``expected-error`` as one because the ``-verify`` line; does not contain that as a prefix. Thus, this test would fail verification; because an unexpected diagnostic would appear on the declaration of ``E``. Multiple occurrences accumulate prefixes.

Then, to build the final optimized binary, build the stage2-clang-bolt target:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja stage2-clang-bolt. 3-Stage Non-Determinism; =======================. In the ancient lore of compilers non-determinism is like the multi-headed hydra.; Whenever its head pops up, terror and chaos ensue. Historically one of the tests to verify that a compiler was deterministic would; be a three stage build. The idea of a three stage build is you take your sources; and build a compiler (stage1), then use that compiler to rebuild the sources; (stage2), then you use that compiler to rebuild the sources a third time; (stage3) with an identical configuration to the stage2 build. At the end of; this, you have a stage2 and stage3 compiler that should be bit-for-bit; identical. You can perform one of these 3-stage builds with LLVM and clang using the; following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/3-stage.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage3. After the build you can compare the stage2 and stage3 compilers.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst:11580,test,tests,11580,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"configured, you don't need to do it; again (unless the test code or configure script changes). Configuring External Tests; ==========================. In order to run the External tests in the ``test-suite`` module, you; must specify *--with-externals*. This must be done during the; *re-configuration* step (see above), and the ``llvm`` re-configuration; must recognize the previously-built ``llvm-gcc``. If any of these is; missing or neglected, the External tests won't work. * *--with-externals*. * *--with-externals=<directory>*. This tells LLVM where to find any external tests. They are expected to; be in specifically named subdirectories of <``directory``>. If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output.

Testability,"creates one in; the `ClassDef` macro that is defined in `$ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h`.; `ClassDef` defines several methods for any class, and one of them is the; `Streamer`. The automatically generated `Streamer `is complete and can; be used as long as no customization is needed. The `Event` class is defined in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.h`. Looking at the; class definition, we find that it inherits from **`TObject`**. It is a; simple example of a class with diverse data members. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; TDirectory *fTransient; //! current directory; Float_t fPt; //! transient value; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr; //|| don't split; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; ...; ```. The Event class is added to the dictionary by the `rootcling`; utility. This is the `rootcling` statement in the; `$ROOTSYS/test/Makefile`:. ``` {.cpp}; @rootcling -f EventDict.cxx -c Event.h EventLinkDef.h; ```. The `EventDict.cxx` file contains the automatically generated; `Streamer `for Event:. ``` {.cpp}; void Event::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b){; // Stream an object of class Event.; if (R__b.IsReading()) {; Event::Class()->ReadBuffer(R__b, this);; } else {; Event::Class()->WriteBuffer(R__b, this);; }; }; ```. When writing an `Event` object, `TClass::WriteBuffer` is called.; `WriteBuffer` writes the current version number of the `Event class,`; and its contents into the buffer `R__b`. The `Streamer `calls; **`TClass::ReadBuffer`** when reading an `Event` object. The `ReadBuffer`; method reads the information from buffer `R__b` into the `Event`; object. ### Transient Data Members (//!).

Testability,"cribe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow. How can I tell if my front-end is following the rules?; ------------------------------------------------------. There is currently no checker for the getelementptr rules. Currently, the only; way to do this is to manually check each place in your front-end where; GetElementPtr operators are created. It's not possible to write a checker which could find all rule violations; statically. It would be possible to write a checker which works by instrumenting; the code with dynamic checks though. Alternatively, it would be possible to; write a static checker which catches a subset of possible problems. However, no; such checke",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:18141,log,logically,18141,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['log'],['logically']
Testability,"cribed in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces.

This will take twice as long. * On the final candidate you just need Release builds, and that's the binary; directory you'll have to pack. * On macOS, you must export ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9`` before running; the script. This script builds three phases of Clang+LLVM twice each (Release and; Release+Asserts), so use screen or nohup to avoid headaches, since it'll take; a long time.

If you use the first (simple) case a viewer using logical/physical pairs; will generate sequential IDs for each physical object internally. Scene; rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical; objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client; side, which must be unique and stable - i.e. the IDs of a published; object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained; child geometry branches. In this case the viewer can safely cache the; physical objects across scene rebuilds, discarding those no longer of; interest. #### Child Objects. In many geometries there is a rigid containment hierarchy, and so if the; viewer is not interested in a certain object due to limits/size then it; will also not be interest in any of the contained branch of siblings.; Both `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` methods have an `addChildren` return; parameter. The viewer will complete this (if passed) indicating if; children of the object just sent are worth sending. #### Recycling TBuffer3D. Once add `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` has been called, the contents are; copied to the viewer's internal data structures. You are free to destroy; this **`TBuffer3D`**, or recycle it for the next object if suitable. #### Examples.

The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead. The compile callback will; compile the function, update the function pointer for the stub, then execute; the function.

At the end, ``bugpoint`` should tell you what passes crash, give you a; bitcode file, and give you instructions on how to reproduce the failure with; ``opt`` or ``llc``. .. _code generator debugger:. Code generator debugger; -----------------------. The code generator debugger attempts to narrow down the amount of code that is; being miscompiled by the selected code generator. To do this, it takes the test; program and partitions it into two pieces: one piece which it compiles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:. Miscompilation debugger; -----------------------. The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger. It; works by splitting the test program into two pieces, running the optimizations; specified on one piece, linking the two pieces back together, and then executing; the result. It attempts to narrow down the list of passes to the one (or few); which are causing the miscompilation, then reduce the portion of the test; program which is being miscompiled.

""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives reject the input if there are any newlines between; it and the previous directive. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is also useful to avoid writing matchers for irrelevant; fields.

To write a test that verifies ``foo`` has the value ``1``, you might first; write this:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value: 1{{$}}. However, this would be a bad test: if the value for ``foo`` changes, the test; would still pass because the ""``CHECK: Value: 1``"" line would match the value; from ``baz``. To fix this, you could add ``CHECK-NEXT`` matchers for every; ``FieldN:`` line, but that would be verbose, and need to be updated when; ``Field4`` is added.

Testability,"ctive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes you want to disable a FileCheck directive without removing it; entirely, or you want to write comments that mention a directive by name. The; ""``COM:``"" directive makes it easy to do this. For example, you might have:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; X32: pinsrd_1:; ; X32: pinsrd $1, 4(%esp), %xmm0. ; COM: FIXME: X64 isn't working correctly yet for this part of codegen, but; ; COM: X64 will have something similar to X32:; ; COM:; ; COM: X64: pinsrd_1:; ; COM: X64: pinsrd $1, %edi, %xmm0. Without ""``COM:``"", you would need to use some combination of rewording and; directive syntax mangling to prevent FileCheck from recognizing the commented; occurrences of ""``X32:``"" and ""``X64:``"" above as directives. Moreover,; FileCheck diagnostics have been proposed that might complain about the above; occurrences of ""``X64``"" that don't have the trailing ""``:``"" because they look; like directive typos. Dodging all these problems can be tedious for a test; author, and directive syntax mangling can make the purpose of test code unclear.; ""``COM:``"" avoids all these problems. A few important usage notes:. * ""``COM:``"" within another directive's pattern does *not* comment out the; remainder of the pattern. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; X32: pinsrd $1, 4(%esp), %xmm0 COM: This is part of the X32 pattern!. If you need to temporarily comment out part of a directive's pattern, move it; to another line. The reason is that FileCheck parses ""``COM:``"" in the same; manner as any other directive: only the first directive on the line is; recognized as a directive. * For the sake of LIT, FileCheck treats ""``RUN:``"" just like ""``COM:``"". If this; is not suitable for your test environment, see :option:`--comment-prefixes`. * FileCheck does not recognize ""``COM``"", ""``RUN``"", or any user-defined comment; prefix as a comment directive if it's combined with one of the usual check; directive suffixes, such as ""``-NEXT:``"" or ""``-NOT:``"", discussed below.; FileCh",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:11752,test,test,11752,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,2,['test'],['test']
Testability,"ctives reject the input if there are any newlines between; it and the previous directive. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is also useful to avoid writing matchers for irrelevant; fields. For example, suppose you're writing a test which parses a tool that; generates output like this:. .. code-block:: text. Name: foo; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. Name: bar; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 2. Name: baz; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. To write a test that verifies ``foo`` has the value ``1``, you might first; write this:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value: 1{{$}}. However, this would be a bad test: if the value for ``foo`` changes, the test; would still pass because the ""``CHECK: Value: 1``"" line would match the value; from ``baz``. To fix this, you could add ``CHECK-NEXT`` matchers for every; ``FieldN:`` line, but that would be verbose, and need to be updated when; ``Field4`` is added. A more succinct way to write the test using the; ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" matcher would be as follows:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value:; CHECK-SAME: {{ 1$}}. This verifies that the *next* time ""``Value:``"" appears in the output, it has; the value ``1``. Note: a ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" cannot be the first directive in a file. The ""CHECK-EMPTY:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you need to check that the next line has nothing on it, not even whitespace,; you can use the ""``CHECK-EMPTY:``"" directive. .. code-block:: llvm. declare void @foo(). declare void @bar(); ; CHECK: foo; ; CHECK-EMPTY:; ; CHECK-NEXT: bar. Just like ""``CHECK-NEXT:``"" the directive will fail if there is more than one; newline before it finds the next blank line, and it cannot be the first; directive in a file. The ""CHECK-NOT:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ""``CHECK-NOT:``"" directive is used to verify that a string doesn't occur; between two matches (or before the first match, or after the last match).

Testability,"cture, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------. The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the progr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:2699,test,tested,2699,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,['test'],"['tested', 'tests']"

Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html:6235,assert,assertions,6235,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,1,['assert'],['assertions']

Winkler and F. James.; More information on the new C++ version can be found on the; MINUIT Web Site. Minuit2, originally developed in the SEAL project, is now distributed within %ROOT.; The API has been then changed in this new version to follow the %ROOT coding convention (function names starting with capital letters) and the classes have been moved inside the namespace ROOT::Minuit2.; In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements the interface; ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2. An example of using this interface is; the %ROOT tutorial tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C or; the Minuit2 test program testMinimize.cxx. A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be downloaded from here. It does not contain the %ROOT interface and it is therefore totally independent of external packages and can be simply build using the configure script and then make. Example tests are provided in the directory test/MnSim and test/MnTutorial and they can be built with the make check command.

Testability,"d a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly. While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate. If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.01; }. The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases. The mem2reg optimization; pass is the answer to dealing with mutable variables, and we highly; recommend that you depend on it. Note that mem2reg only works on; variables in certain circumstances:. #. mem2reg is alloca-driven: it looks for allocas and if it can handle; them, it promotes them. It does not apply to global variables or heap; allocations.; #. mem2reg only looks for alloca instructions in the entry block of the; function.

One way to do that; is to use the `-merge=1` flag:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir NEW_CORPUS_DIR # Store minimized corpus here.; ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 NEW_CORPUS_DIR FULL_CORPUS_DIR. You may use the same flag to add more interesting items to an existing corpus.; Only the inputs that trigger new coverage will be added to the first corpus. .. code-block:: console. ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 CURRENT_CORPUS_DIR NEW_POTENTIALLY_INTERESTING_INPUTS_DIR. Running; -------. To run the fuzzer, first create a Corpus_ directory that holds the; initial ""seed"" sample inputs:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir CORPUS_DIR; cp /some/input/samples/* CORPUS_DIR. Then run the fuzzer on the corpus directory:. .. code-block:: console. ./my_fuzzer CORPUS_DIR # -max_len=1000 -jobs=20 ... As the fuzzer discovers new interesting test cases (i.e. test cases that; trigger coverage of new paths through the code under test), those test cases; will be added to the corpus directory. By default, the fuzzing process will continue indefinitely – at least until; a bug is found. Any crashes or sanitizer failures will be reported as usual,; stopping the fuzzing process, and the particular input that triggered the bug; will be written to disk (typically as ``crash-<sha1>``, ``leak-<sha1>``,; or ``timeout-<sha1>``). Parallel Fuzzing; ----------------. Each libFuzzer process is single-threaded, unless the library under test starts; its own threads. However, it is possible to run multiple libFuzzer processes in; parallel with a shared corpus directory; this has the advantage that any new; inputs found by one fuzzer process will be available to the other fuzzer; processes (unless you disable this with the ``-reload=0`` option). This is primarily controlled by the ``-jobs=N`` option, which indicates that; that `N` fuzzing jobs should be run to completion (i.e. until a bug is found or; time/iteration limits ar",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:5942,test,test,5942,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,3,['test'],['test']

There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework.

If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; However, we disallow error messages in gtests, or sometimes we want to test the; error conditions of an interface and its diagnostics.

Testability,"d is available. Automatic reference counting; ----------------------------. Clang provides support for :doc:`automated reference counting; <AutomaticReferenceCounting>` in Objective-C, which eliminates the need; for manual ``retain``/``release``/``autorelease`` message sends. There are three; feature macros associated with automatic reference counting:; ``__has_feature(objc_arc)`` indicates the availability of automated reference; counting in general, while ``__has_feature(objc_arc_weak)`` indicates that; automated reference counting also includes support for ``__weak`` pointers to; Objective-C objects. ``__has_feature(objc_arc_fields)`` indicates that C structs; are allowed to have fields that are pointers to Objective-C objects managed by; automatic reference counting. .. _objc-weak:. Weak references; ---------------. Clang supports ARC-style weak and unsafe references in Objective-C even; outside of ARC mode. Weak references must be explicitly enabled with; the ``-fobjc-weak`` option; use ``__has_feature((objc_arc_weak))``; to test whether they are enabled. Unsafe references are enabled; unconditionally. ARC-style weak and unsafe references cannot be used; when Objective-C garbage collection is enabled. Except as noted below, the language rules for the ``__weak`` and; ``__unsafe_unretained`` qualifiers (and the ``weak`` and; ``unsafe_unretained`` property attributes) are just as laid out; in the :doc:`ARC specification <AutomaticReferenceCounting>`.; In particular, note that some classes do not support forming weak; references to their instances, and note that special care must be; taken when storing weak references in memory where initialization; and deinitialization are outside the responsibility of the compiler; (such as in ``malloc``-ed memory). Loading from a ``__weak`` variable always implicitly retains the; loaded value. In non-ARC modes, this retain is normally balanced; by an implicit autorelease. This autorelease can be suppressed; by performing the load",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:71758,test,test,71758,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Removes all files generated by the build. This includes object files,; generated C/C++ files, libraries, and executables. ``make install``. Installs LLVM header files, libraries, tools, and documentation in a hierarchy; under ``$PREFIX``, specified with ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, which; defaults to ``/usr/local``. ``make docs-llvm-html``. If configured with ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=On``, this will generate a directory; at ``OBJ_ROOT/docs/html`` which contains the HTML formatted documentation. Cross-Compiling LLVM; --------------------. It is possible to cross-compile LLVM itself. That is, you can create LLVM; executables and libraries to be hosted on a platform different from the platform; where they are built (a Canadian Cross build). To generate build files for; cross-compiling CMake provides a variable ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` which can; define compiler flags and variables used during the CMake test operations. The result of such a build is executables that are not runnable on the build; host but can be executed on the target. As an example the following CMake; invocation can generate build files targeting iOS. This will work on macOS; with the latest Xcode:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Ninja"" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=""armv7;armv7s;arm64""; -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<PATH_TO_LLVM>/cmake/platforms/iOS.cmake; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=Off -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=Off; -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=Off -DLLVM_ENABLE_BACKTRACES=Off [options]; <PATH_TO_LLVM>.

A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C. For more information about some of the advanced build configurations supported; via Cache files see :doc:`AdvancedBuilds`. Executing the Tests; ===================.

This might produce; this code:. movaps c(%esp), %xmm1; movaps %xmm1, c2(%esp); ... xorps %xmm0, %xmm0; movaps c2(%esp), %xmm1; movss %xmm1, %xmm0; ret. However, since the reload is only used by these instructions, we could ; ""fold"" it into the uses, producing something like this:. movaps c(%esp), %xmm1; movaps %xmm1, c2(%esp); ... movss c2(%esp), %xmm0; ret. ... saving two instructions. The basic idea is that a reload from a spill slot, can, if only one 4-byte ; chunk is used, bring in 3 zeros the one element instead of 4 elements.; This can be used to simplify a variety of shuffle operations, where the; elements are fixed zeros. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//.

Testability,"d; completes, pass -V to scan-build. Recommended Usage Guidelines; This section describes a few recommendations with running the analyzer.; ALWAYS analyze a project in its ""debug"" configuration; Most projects can be built in a ""debug"" mode that enables assertions.; Assertions are picked up by the static analyzer to prune infeasible paths, which; in some cases can greatly reduce the number of false positives (bogus error; reports) emitted by the tool.; Another option is to use --force-analyze-debug-code flag of; scan-build tool which would enable assertions automatically.; Use verbose output when debugging scan-build; scan-build takes a -v option to emit verbose output about; what it's doing; two -v options emit more information. Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan-build in order to analyze the project.; Example. $ scan-build ./configure; $ scan-build --keep-cc make. The reason configure also needs to be run through; scan-build is because scan-build scans your source files by; interposing on the compiler. This interposition is currently done by; scan-build temporarily setting the environment variable CC to; ccc-analyzer. The program ccc-analyzer acts like a fake; compiler, forwarding its command line arguments over to the compiler to perform; regular compilation and clang to perform static analysis.; Running configure typically generates makefiles that have hardwired; paths to the compiler, and by running configure through; scan-build that path is set to ccc-analyzer.

Testability,"d; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds. .. _test-status-results:. TEST STATUS RESULTS; -------------------. Each test ultimately produces one of the following eight results:. **PASS**. The test succeeded. **FLAKYPASS**. The test succeeded after being re-run more than once. This only applies to; tests containing an ``ALLOW_RETRIES:`` annotation. **XFAIL**. The test failed, but that is expected. This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure. Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about; their status (generally only for failures). See the :ref:`output-options`; section for more information. ..

Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case.

There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; li",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15419,test,testl,15419,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['test'],['testl']

Testability,"der to; complete ~10-15 builds an hour. Resource Appropriately; At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every; 4 to 6 minutes. For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs,; this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine. In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration. For some rough back of the envelope; numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will need something; on the order of 5-8 workers. If your build config takes ~2 hours, you'll; need something on the order of 20-30 workers. The rest of this section; focuses on how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:9638,test,testing,9638,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"ders (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:47572,test,test,47572,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Target JIT Info; ---------------. ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` implements the JIT interfaces for target-specific; code-generation activities, such as emitting machine code and stubs. At; minimum, a target-specific version of ``XXXJITInfo`` implements the following:. * ``getLazyResolverFunction`` --- Initializes the JIT, gives the target a; function that is used for compilation. * ``emitFunctionStub`` --- Returns a native function with a specified address; for a callback function. * ``relocate`` --- Changes the addresses of referenced globals, based on; relocation types. * Callback function that are wrappers to a function stub that is used when the; real target is not initially known. ``getLazyResolverFunction`` is generally trivial to implement. It makes the; incoming parameter as the global ``JITCompilerFunction`` and returns the; callback function that will be used a function wrapper. For the Alpha target; (in ``AlphaJITInfo.cpp``), the ``getLazyResolverFunction`` implementation is; simply:. .. code-block:: c++. TargetJITInfo::LazyResolverFn AlphaJITInfo::getLazyResolverFunction(; JITCompilerFn F) {; JITCompilerFunction = F;; return AlphaCompilationCallback;; }. For the X86 target, the ``getLazyResolverFunction`` implementation is a little; more complicated, because it returns a different callback function for; processors with SSE instructions and XMM registers. The callback function initially saves and later restores the callee register; values, incoming arguments, and frame and return address. The callback; function needs low-level access to the registers or stack, so it is typically; implemented with a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst:82653,stub,stub,82653,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,1,['stub'],['stub']

Testability,"does not evenly divide the vectorization and unroll factors. When the; vectorization and unroll factors are large, it's possible for loops with smaller; trip counts to end up spending most of their time in the scalar (rather than; the vector) code. In order to address this issue, the inner loop vectorizer is; enhanced with a feature that allows it to vectorize epilogue loops with a; vectorization and unroll factor combination that makes it more likely for small; trip count loops to still execute in vectorized code. The diagram below shows; the CFG for a typical epilogue vectorized loop with runtime checks. As; illustrated the control flow is structured in a way that avoids duplicating the; runtime pointer checks and optimizes the path length for loops that have very; small trip counts. .. image:: epilogue-vectorization-cfg.png.

Testability,"dows,; ; and is disabled when targeting Linux, except for Android Linux.; ; UNSUPPORTED: system-windows, target={{.*linux.*}} && !target={{.*android.*}}; ; This test is expected to fail when targeting PowerPC or running on Darwin.; ; XFAIL: target=powerpc{{.*}}, system-darwin. Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify. For; example, ``target=mips{{.*}}`` will match not only mips, but also mipsel,; mips64, and mips64el. ``target={{.*}}-linux-gnu`` will match; x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, but not armv8l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.; Prefer to use hyphens to delimit triple components (``target=mips-{{.*}}``); and it's generally a good idea to use a trailing wildcard to allow for; unexpected suffixes. Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them.

If `-fno-openmp-use-tls`; is provided or target does not support TLS, code generation for threadprivate; variables relies on OpenMP runtime library. .. _opencl:. OpenCL Features; ===============. Clang can be used to compile OpenCL kernels for execution on a device; (e.g. GPU). It is possible to compile the kernel into a binary (e.g. for AMDGPU); that can be uploaded to run directly on a device (e.g. using; `clCreateProgramWithBinary; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf#111>`_) or; into generic bitcode files loadable into other toolchains. Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl. Compiling to bitcode can be done as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -c -emit-llvm test.cl. This will produce a file `test.bc` that can be used in vendor toolchains; to perform machine code generation. Note that if compiled to bitcode for generic targets such as SPIR/SPIR-V,; portable IR is produced that can be used with various vendor; tools as well as open source tools such as `SPIRV-LLVM Translator; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_; to produce SPIR-V binary.

Hardware; --------; Any system that can adequately run Visual Studio 2019 is fine. The LLVM; source tree including the git index consumes approximately 3GB.; Object files, libraries and executables consume approximately 5GB in; Release mode and much more in Debug mode. SSD drive and >16GB RAM are; recommended. Software; --------; You will need `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`_ 2019 or; later, with the latest Update installed. Visual Studio Community Edition; suffices. You will also need the `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ build system since it; generates the project files you will use to build with. CMake is bundled with; Visual Studio 2019 so separate installation is not required. If you do install; CMake separately, Visual Studio 2022 will require CMake Version 3.21 or later. If you would like to run the LLVM tests you will need `Python; <http://www.python.org/>`_. Version 3.6 and newer are known to work. You can; install Python with Visual Studio 2019, from the Microsoft store or from; the `Python web site <http://www.python.org/>`_. We recommend the latter since it; allows you to adjust installation options. You will need `Git for Windows <https://git-scm.com/>`_ with bash tools, too.; Git for Windows is also bundled with Visual Studio 2019.

For this to work correctly the logical object in must be; described in **`TBuffer3D`** in the local reference frame, complete with; the local`/`master translation. In some cases you will not have a real; object you can reasonably set **`TBuffer3D::fID` to, or the object is; recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in; these cases, set `TBuffer3D::fID` to 0 (null).**. The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the; **`TVirtualViewer3D`** interface method: `PreferLocalFrame()`. If this; returns `kTRUE` you can make repeated calls to `AddObject()`, with; **`TBuffer3D`** containing the same `fID`, and different `fLocalMaster`; placements. For viewers supporting logical/physical objects, the TBuffer3D content; refers to the properties of the logical object, with the exception of:. - `fLocalMaster` transform. - `fColor `. - `fTransparency`. attributes, which can be varied for **each** physical object. As **a minimum requirement** all clients must be capable of filling the; raw tessellation of the object buffer, in the master reference frame.; Conversely viewers must always be capable of displaying the object; described by this buffer.

Testability,"e a simple; example: we want to plot `fPx` of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object. To build this file and tree follow the instructions on how to; build the examples in `$ROOTSYS/test`. Execute `Event` and instruct it; to split the object with this command (from the UNIX command line). ``` {.cpp}; > $ROOTSYS/test/Event 400 1 2 1; ```. This creates an `Event.root` file with 400 events, compressed, split,; and filled. See `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx` for more info. The person who designed the tree makes a shared library available to; you, which defines the classes needed. In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`. The designer also gives you the `Event.h` file to; see the definition of the classes. You can locate `Event.h` in; `$ROOTSYS/test`, and if you have not yet built `libEvent.so`, please see; the instructions of how to build it (typing make in \$ROOTSYS/test is; enough). If you have already built it, you can now use it again. ### Creating a Class with MakeClass. First, we load the shared library and open `Event.root`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L libEvent.so; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] f->ls();; TFile** Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; TFile* Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; KEY: TH1F htime;1 Real-Time to write versus time; KEY: TTree T;1 An example of a ROOT tree; ```. We can see there is a tree ""`T`"", and just to verify that we are working; with the correct one, we print the tree, which will show us the header; and branches. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Print();; ```. From the output of print we can see that the tree has one branch for; each data member of `Event`, `Track`, and `EventHeader`. Now we can use; `TTree::MakeClass` on our tree ""`T`"". `MakeClass` takes one parameter, a; string containing the name of the class to be made.

See ""Example 2: A Tree with a C Structure"" below; (`$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/tree2.C`) and `staff.C` at the beginning of; this chapter. ## Adding a TBranch to Hold an Object. To write a branch to hold an event object, we need to load the; definition of the `Event` class, which is in `$ROOTSYS/test/libEvent.so`; (if it doesn't exist type make in `$ROOTSYS/test`). An object can be; saved in a tree if a ROOT dictionary for its class has been generated; and loaded. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L libEvent.so; ```. First, we need to open a file and create a tree. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE""); root[] TTree *tree = new TTree(""T"",""A Root Tree""); ```. We need to create a pointer to an `Event` object that will be used as a; reference in the `TTree::Branch` method. Then we create a branch; with the `TTree::Branch` method. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Event *event = new Event(); root[] tree->Branch(""EventBranch"",""Event"",&event,32000,99); ```.

Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently; that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound; and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably. Constraints management. New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.; The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions; and can thus be modeled by RooAbsPdf classes (e.g. a RooGaussian for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).; There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying; the constraint p.d.f.s with your 'master' p.d.f. or you specify them externally in each operation. The; first mode of operation keeps all information in your master p.d.f and may make the logistics of non-trivial; fitting problems easier. It works as follows: first you define your regular p.d.f, then you define your; constraint p.d.f and you multiply them with RooProdPdf. // Construct constraint; RooGaussian fconstraint(""fconstraint"",""fconstraint"",f,RooConst(0.8),RooConst(0.1)) ;. // Multiply constraint with p.d.f; RooProdPdf pdfc(""pdfc"",""p.d.f with constraint"",RooArgSet(p.d.f,fconstraint)) ;. If your top level p.d.f is already a RooProdPdf it also fine to multiply all terms together in one go.; Constraints do not need to be specified a the top-level RooProdPdf, constraint p.d.f.s in any component; RooProdPdf lower in the expression tree are used as well. Constraints are not used by default in fitting; if present in a p.d.f. To activate the use of a constraint in fitting, use the Constrain() argument in fitTo(). // Fit with internal constraint; RooFitResult* r2 = pdfc.fitTo(*d,Constrain(f)) ;; ; This will instruct RooAbsPdf::fitTo() to included any constraint p.d.f on parameter f in th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:7233,log,logistics,7233,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,1,['log'],['logistics']

See also [Category reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooCategory.html). ### Type-safe proxies for RooFit objects; RooFit's proxy classes have been modernised. The class `RooTemplateProxy` allows for access to other RooFit objects; similarly to a smart pointer. In older versions of RooFit, the objects held by *e.g.* `RooRealProxy` had to be; accessed like this:; RooAbsArg* absArg = realProxy.absArg();; RooAbsPdf* pdf = dynamic_cast<RooAbsPdf*>(absArg);; assert(pdf); // This *should* work, but the proxy doesn't have a way to check; pdf->fitTo(...);; That is, a `RooRealProxy` stores a pointer to a RooAbsArg, and this pointer has to be cast. There was no type; safety, *i.e.*, any object deriving from RooAbsArg could be stored in that proxy, and the user had to take care; of ensuring that types are correct.; Now, if one uses; RooTemplateProxy<RooAbsPdf> pdfProxy;; instead of; RooRealProxy realProxy;; in RooFit classes, the above code can be simplified to; pdfProxy->fitTo(...);. Check the [doxygen reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooTemplateProxy.html) for `RooTemplateProxy` for; more information on how to modernise old code. ### HistFactory. #### Switch default statistical MC errors to Poisson; When defining HistFactory samples with statistical errors from C++, e.g.; Sample background1( ""background1"", ""background1"", InputFile );; background1.ActivateStatError();; statistical MC errors now have Poisson instead of Gaussian constraint",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:4454,assert,assert,4454,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,1,['assert'],['assert']

As argument of `Show()` method one can specify browser kind like; ""chromium"" or ""firefox"" or just full path to the program which should be invoked.; With the method `win->GetUrl()` one obtains URL string, which can be typed in the browser address string directly. Same window can be displayed several times in different browsers or different browser tabs - one only; must allow appropriate number of connections calling `win->SetConnLimit(3)`.

This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own.

Testability,"e functions to the minimizers. Only Minuit2 (see below) has the capabilities of using this external Hessian. The `GradFunctor` class has been improved by providing a new constructor taking an `std::function` implementing the full gradient calculations instead of the single partial derivative. The specialized methods for least-square/likelihood functions such as Fumili, Fumili2 and GSLMultiFit have been improved in case of binned likelihood fits, where a better approximation is used than before. This makes these method work better (conerging with less number of function calls) for these types of fits. ### Minuit2. The support for using an External Hessian calculator has been added. The external Hessian can be used for both the initial seeding, using only the diagonal part, if the strategy is equal to 1 (the default value) and in `MnHesse`, after the minimization, to compute the covariance and correlation matrices. The print log of Minuit2 has been improved, especially when printing vector and matrices with large number of parameters (when the print level = 3). ### KahanSum updates. The `ROOT::Math::KahanSum` class was slightly modified:; - The behavior of `operator-=` and `operator+=` on a `KahanSum` were not symmetric, leading to slight bit-wise inaccuracies. In fits, where such operations are done a lot of times (e.g. through the offsetting mechanism in RooFit which subtracts a constant `KahanSum` term after each likelihood evaluation), this can add up to significant numerical divergence. An improved algorithm was implemented, based on an algorithm for combining Kahan sums and carry terms (Tian et al. 2012). (PR #11940); - The auto-conversion to type `T` and implicit type `T` constructor in `KahanSum` made it hard to debug `KahanSum`, because it is easy to overlook implicit conversions in code, especially in lines where the type of the return value is `auto`. These auto-conversions were removed.

Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library!

Granted, if the community differs on this proposal, the legacy code could still; be present in the tool, but with the caveat of still being documented and; designed towards delta reduction. ### Command-Line Options; We are proposing to reduce the plethora of bugpoint’s options to just two: an; interesting-ness test and the arguments for said test, similar to other delta; reduction tools such as CReduce, Delta, and Lithium; the tool should feel less; cluttered, and there should also be no uncertainty about how to operate it.

Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected to populate. The following variables are also; available on the *config* object, some of which must be set by the config and; others are optional or predefined:. **name** *[required]* The name of the test suite, for use in reports and; diagnostics. **test_format** *[required]* The test format object which will be used to; discover and run tests in the test suite.

MC/DC Instrumentation; ---------------------. When instrumenting for Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) using the; clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``, users are limited to at most **six** leaf-level; conditions in a boolean expression. A warning will be generated for boolean; expressions that contain more than six, and they will not be instrumented for; MC/DC. Also, if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean; expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not supported.; For example, in ``x = (a && b && c && func(d && f))``, the ``d && f`` case; starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other conditions by; the operator ``func()``.

Testability,"e to inlining creating nested exception; handling scopes. Restrictions; ------------. The unwinder delegates the decision of whether to stop in a call frame to that; call frame's language-specific personality function. Not all unwinders guarantee; that they will stop to perform cleanups. For example, the GNU C++ unwinder; doesn't do so unless the exception is actually caught somewhere further up the; stack. In order for inlining to behave correctly, landing pads must be prepared to; handle selector results that they did not originally advertise. Suppose that a; function catches exceptions of type ``A``, and it's inlined into a function that; catches exceptions of type ``B``. The inliner will update the ``landingpad``; instruction for the inlined landing pad to include the fact that ``B`` is also; caught. If that landing pad assumes that it will only be entered to catch an; ``A``, it's in for a rude awakening. Consequently, landing pads must test for; the selector results they understand and then resume exception propagation with; the `resume instruction <LangRef.html#i_resume>`_ if none of the conditions; match. Exception Handling Intrinsics; =============================. In addition to the ``landingpad`` and ``resume`` instructions, LLVM uses several; intrinsic functions (name prefixed with ``llvm.eh``) to provide exception; handling information at various points in generated code. .. _llvm.eh.typeid.for:. ``llvm.eh.typeid.for``; ----------------------. .. code-block:: llvm. i32 @llvm.eh.typeid.for(i8* %type_info).

While this is likely to have a; high performance cost, some applications may be in a good position to take this; performance / security tradeoff. The specific technique we propose is to cause loads to be checked using; branchless code to ensure that they are executing along a valid control flow; path. Consider the following C-pseudo-code representing the core idea of a; predicate guarding potentially invalid loads:; ```; void leak(int data);; void example(int* pointer1, int* pointer2) {; if (condition) {; // ... lots of code ...; leak(*pointer1);; } else {; // ... more code ...; leak(*pointer2);; }; }; ```. This would get transformed into something resembling the following:; ```; uintptr_t all_ones_mask = std::numerical_limits<uintptr_t>::max();; uintptr_t all_zeros_mask = 0;; void leak(int data);; void example(int* pointer1, int* pointer2) {; uintptr_t predicate_state = all_ones_mask;; if (condition) {; // Assuming ?: is implemented using branchless logic...; predicate_state = !condition ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... lots of code ...; //; // Harden the pointer so it can't be loaded; pointer1 &= predicate_state;; leak(*pointer1);; } else {; predicate_state = condition ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... more code ...; //; // Alternative: Harden the loaded value; int value2 = *pointer2 & predicate_state;; leak(value2);; }; }; ```. The result should be that if the `if (condition) {` branch is mis-predicted,; there is a *data* dependency on the condition used to zero out any pointers; prior to loading through them or to zero out all of the loaded bits.

Any modification; to these references will affect the elements of ``Letters`` or ``Counts``. The ``zip``\ * functions support temporary ranges, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Letter, Count] : zip(SmallVector<char>{'a', 'b', 'c'}, Counts)); errs() << Letter << "": "" << Count << ""\n"";. The difference between the functions in the ``zip`` family is how they behave; when the supplied ranges have different lengths:. * ``zip_equal`` -- requires all input ranges have the same length.; * ``zip`` -- iteration stops when the end of the shortest range is reached.; * ``zip_first`` -- requires the first range is the shortest one.; * ``zip_longest`` -- iteration continues until the end of the longest range is; reached. The non-existent elements of shorter ranges are replaced with; ``std::nullopt``. The length requirements are checked with ``assert``\ s. As a rule of thumb, prefer to use ``zip_equal`` when you expect all; ranges to have the same lengths, and consider alternative ``zip`` functions only; when this is not the case. This is because ``zip_equal`` clearly communicates; this same-length assumption and has the best (release-mode) runtime performance. .. _uf_enumerate:. ``enumerate``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Any ``defvar`` variables defined in the bodies go out of scope; when the bodies are finished (see `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details). The ``if`` statement can also be used in a record :token:`Body`. ``assert`` --- check that a condition is true; ---------------------------------------------. The ``assert`` statement checks a boolean condition to be sure that it is true; and prints an error message if it is not. .. productionlist::; Assert: ""assert"" `condition` "","" `message` "";"". If the boolean condition is true, the statement does nothing. If the; condition is false, it prints a nonfatal error message. The **message**, which; can be an arbitrary string expression, is included in the error message as a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class. The assertions are; then checked when the records are completely built. * In a multiclass definition, the assertions are saved with the other; components of the multiclass and then checked each time the multiclass; is instantiated with ``defm``. Using assertions in TableGen files can simplify record checking in TableGen; backends. Here is an example of an ``assert`` in two class definitions. .. code-block:: text. class PersonName<string name> {; assert !le(!size(name), 32), ""person name is too long: "" # name;; string Name = name;; }. class Person<string name, int age> : PersonName<name> {; assert !and(!ge(age, 1), !le(age, 120)), ""person age is invalid: "" # age;; int Age = age;; }. def Rec20 : Person<""Donald Knuth"",",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:49455,assert,assertion,49455,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['assert'],['assertion']

The **`TGTransientFrame`** class defines transient windows that; typically are used for dialogs. They extend and complete an interaction; within a limited context.

In those cases, to enforce the order, use a non-DAG directive between DAG-blocks. A ``CHECK-DAG:`` directive skips matches that overlap the matches of any; preceding ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block. Not only; is this non-overlapping behavior consistent with other directives, but it's; also necessary to handle sets of non-unique strings or patterns. For example,; the following directives look for unordered log entries for two tasks in a; parallel program, such as the OpenMP runtime:. .. code-block:: text. // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end; //; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end. The second pair of directives is guaranteed not to match the same log entries; as the first pair even though the patterns are identical and even if the text; of the log entries is identical because the thread ID manages to be reused. The ""CHECK-LABEL:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes in a file containing multiple tests divided into logical blocks, one; or more ``CHECK:`` directives may inadvertently succeed by matching lines in a; later block. While an error will usually eventually be generated, the check; flagged as causing the error may not actually bear any relationship to the; actual source of the problem. In order to produce better error messages in these cases, the ""``CHECK-LABEL:``""; directive can be used. It is treated identically to a normal ``CHECK``; directive except that FileCheck makes an additional assumption that a line; matched by the directive cannot also be matched by any other check present in; ``match-filename``; this is intended to be used for lines containing labels or; other unique identifiers.

To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again. In the above example,; setting the limit to 1 will thus cause lit to report an error instead of; producing incorrect output. Options; -------.

If it existed somewhere; else in the file, that would not count: ""``grep subl``"" matches if ""``subl``""; exists anywhere in the file. The FileCheck -check-prefix option; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The FileCheck `-check-prefix` option allows multiple test; configurations to be driven from one `.ll` file. This is useful in many; circumstances, for example, testing different architectural variants with; :program:`llc`.

If referenced from a; ``call`` instruction, it uses the ``metadata`` type. All metadata are identified in syntax by an exclamation point ('``!``'). .. _metadata-string:. Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings; -----------------------------------. A metadata string is a string surrounded by double quotes. It can; contain any character by escaping non-printable characters with; ""``\xx``"" where ""``xx``"" is the two digit hex code. For example:; ""``!""test\00""``"". Metadata nodes are represented with notation similar to structure; constants (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by braces and; preceded by an exclamation point). Metadata nodes can have any values as; their operand. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !{ !""test\00"", i32 10}. Metadata nodes that aren't uniqued use the ``distinct`` keyword. For example:. .. code-block:: text. !0 = distinct !{!""test\00"", i32 10}. ``distinct`` nodes are useful when nodes shouldn't be merged based on their; content. They can also occur when transformations cause uniquing collisions; when metadata operands change. A :ref:`named metadata <namedmetadatastructure>` is a collection of; metadata nodes, which can be looked up in the module symbol table. For; example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !foo = !{!4, !3}. Metadata can be used as function arguments. Here the ``llvm.dbg.value``; intrinsic is using three metadata arguments:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata !24, metadata !25, metadata !26). Metadata can be attached to an instruction. Here metadata ``!21`` is attached; to the ``add`` instruction using the ``!dbg`` identifier:. .. code-block:: llvm. %indvar.next = add i64 %indvar, 1, !dbg !21.

The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed. It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare. At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly. It; does this by coalescing contiguous ranges of set bits into intervals. Searching; for a bit in a CoalescingBitVector is O(log(gaps between contiguous ranges)). CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large.

The syntax of the ""``CHECK:``"" lines is very simple: they are fixed strings that; must occur in order. FileCheck defaults to ignoring horizontal whitespace; differences (e.g. a space is allowed to match a tab) but otherwise, the contents; of the ""``CHECK:``"" line is required to match some thing in the test file exactly. One nice thing about FileCheck (compared to grep) is that it allows merging; test cases together into logical groups. For example, because the test above; is checking for the ""``sub1:``"" and ""``inc4:``"" labels, it will not match; unless there is a ""``subl``"" in between those labels. If it existed somewhere; else in the file, that would not count: ""``grep subl``"" matches if ""``subl``""; exists anywhere in the file. The FileCheck -check-prefix option; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The FileCheck `-check-prefix` option allows multiple test; configurations to be driven from one `.ll` file.

On the other hand, LLVM specifies that the `fcmp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#fcmp-instruction>`_ always returns an 'i1' value (a; one bit integer). The problem with this is that Kaleidoscope wants the; value to be a 0.0 or 1.0 value. In order to get these semantics, we; combine the fcmp instruction with a `uitofp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#uitofp-to-instruction>`_. This instruction converts its; input integer into a floating point value by treating the input as an; unsigned value. In contrast, if we used the `sitofp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#sitofp-to-instruction>`_, the Kaleidoscope '<' operator; would return 0.0 and -1.0, depending on the input value. .. code-block:: c++.

Code generation for function calls is quite straightforward with LLVM. The code; above initially does a function name lookup in the LLVM Module's symbol table.; Recall that the LLVM Module is the container that holds the functions we are; JIT'ing. By giving each function the same name as what the user specifies, we; can use the LLVM symbol table to resolve function names for us.

Finally, some targets may provide defined semantics when using the value; as the operand to an inline assembly, but that is target specific. .. _dso_local_equivalent:. DSO Local Equivalent; --------------------. ``dso_local_equivalent @func``. A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol. This is especially useful for the Relative VTables C++ ABI,; where dynamic relocations for function pointers in VTables can be replaced with; static relocations for offsets between the VTable and virtual functions which; may not be ``dso_local``.

If :program:`FileCheck` verifies that the file matches the expected contents,; it exits with 0. Otherwise, if not, or if an error occurs, it will exit with a; non-zero value. TUTORIAL; --------. FileCheck is typically used from LLVM regression tests, being invoked on the RUN; line of the test. A simple example of using FileCheck from a RUN line looks; like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llc -march=x86-64 | FileCheck %s. This syntax says to pipe the current file (""``%s``"") into ``llvm-as``, pipe; that into ``llc``, then pipe the output of ``llc`` into ``FileCheck``. This; means that FileCheck will be verifying its standard input (the llc output); against the filename argument specified (the original ``.ll`` file specified by; ""``%s``""). To see how this works, let's look at the rest of the ``.ll`` file; (after the RUN line):. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @sub1(i32* %p, i32 %v) {; entry:; ; CHECK: sub1:; ; CHECK: subl; %0 = tail call i32 @llvm.atomic.load.sub.i32.p0i32(i32* %p, i32 %v); ret void; }. define void @inc4(i64* %p) {; entry:; ; CHECK: inc4:; ; CHECK: incq; %0 = tail call i64 @llvm.atomic.load.add.i64.p0i64(i64* %p, i64 1); ret void; }.

Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl. Compiling to bitcode can be done as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -c -emit-llvm test.cl. This will produce a file `test.bc` that can be used in vendor toolchains; to perform machine code generation. Note that if compiled to bitcode for generic targets such as SPIR/SPIR-V,; portable IR is produced that can be used with various vendor; tools as well as open source tools such as `SPIRV-LLVM Translator; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_; to produce SPIR-V binary.

An object can be; saved in a tree if a ROOT dictionary for its class has been generated; and loaded. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L libEvent.so; ```.

We need to create a pointer to an `Event` object that will be used as a; reference in the `TTree::Branch` method. Then we create a branch; with the `TTree::Branch` method. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Event *event = new Event(); root[] tree->Branch(""EventBranch"",""Event"",&event,32000,99); ```.

This scheme checks that virtual calls take place using a vptr of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the called object must be a; derived class of the static type of the object used to make the call.; This CFI scheme can be enabled on its own using ``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall``. For this scheme to work, all translation units containing the definition; of a virtual member function (whether inline or not), other than members; of :ref:`ignored <cfi-ignorelist>` types or types with public :doc:`LTO; visibility <LTOVisibility>`, must be compiled with ``-flto`` or ``-flto=thin``; enabled and be statically linked into the program. Performance; -----------. A performance overhead of less than 1% has been measured by running the; Dromaeo benchmark suite against an instrumented version of the Chromium; web browser. Another good performance benchmark for this mechanism is the; virtual-call-heavy SPEC 2006 xalancbmk. Note that this scheme has not yet been optimized for binary size; an increase; of up to 15% has been observed for Chromium. Bad Cast Checking; =================. This scheme checks that pointer casts are made to an object of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the object must be a derived class; of the pointee type of the cast. The checks are currently only introduced; where the class being casted to is a polymorphic class. Bad casts are not in themselves control flow integrity violations, but they; can also create security vulnerabilities, and the implementation uses many; of the same mechanisms. There are two types of bad cast that may be forbidden: bad casts; from a base class to a derived class (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-derived-cast``), and bad casts from a pointer of; type ``void*`` or another unrelated type (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-unrelated-cast``).

We have a script at ``utils/collect_and_build_with_pgo.py``. This script is; tested on a few Linux flavors, and requires a checkout of LLVM, Clang, and; compiler-rt.

Install ``llvm-gcc`` somewhere. #. *Re-configure* ``llvm`` from the top level of each build tree (LLVM; object directory tree) in which you want to run the test suite, just; as you do before building LLVM. During the *re-configuration*, you must either: (1) have ``llvm-gcc``; you just built in your path, or (2) specify the directory where your; just-built ``llvm-gcc`` is installed using; ``--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR``. You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR].

The single vector elements can be set or retrieved using the; `operator[i]`, `operator(i)` or the iterator interface. Notice that the; index starts from zero and not from one as in FORTRAN. Also no check is; performed on the passed index. The full vector elements can be set also; by using the SetElements function passing a generic iterator. ``` {.cpp}; double x = m(i); // return the i-th element; x = *(m.begin()+i); // return the i-th element; v[0] = 1; // set the first element; v(1) = 2; // set the second element; *(v.begin()+3) = 3; // set the third element; std::vector<double> w(3);. // set vector elements from a std::vector<double>::iterator; v.SetElements(w.begin(),w.end());; ```. In addition there are methods to place a sub-vector in a vector. If the; size of the sub-vector is larger than the vector size a static assert (a; compilation error) is produced. ``` {.cpp}; SVector>double,N> v;; SVector>double,M> w;; // M <= N otherwise a compilation error is obtained later; // place a vector of size M starting from; // element ioff, v[ioff+i]=w[i]; v.Place_at(w,ioff);; // return a sub-vector of size M starting from; // v[ioff]: w[i]=v[ioff+i]; w = v.Sub < SVector>double,M> > (ioff);; ```.

Testability,"ed with the aid of computers. A; usable tool therefore must contain easy-to-use and efficient methods for; storing and handling data. In Quantum mechanics, models typically only predict the probability; density function (""pdf"") of measurements depending on a number of; parameters, and the aim of the experimental analysis is to extract the; parameters from the observed distribution of frequencies at which; certain values of the measurement are observed. Measurements of this; kind require means to generate and visualize frequency distributions,; so-called histograms, and stringent statistical treatment to extract the; model parameters from purely statistical distributions. Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data; analysis. By repeated generation of ""pseudo-data"", which are analysed in; the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can; be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the; measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the; possibility to test the effects of different assumptions. A powerful software framework addressing all of the above requirements; is ROOT, an open source project coordinated by the European Organisation for; Nuclear Research, CERN in Geneva. ROOT is very flexible and provides both a programming interface to use in own; applications and a graphical user interface for interactive data analysis. The; purpose of this document is to serve as a beginners guide and provides extendable; examples for your own use cases, based on typical problems addressed in; student labs. This guide will hopefully lay the ground for more complex; applications in your future scientific work building on a modern,; state-of the art tool for data analysis. This guide in form of a tutorial is intended to introduce you quickly to the; ROOT package. This goal will be accomplished using concrete examples, according; to the ""learning by doing"" principle.

SYNOPSIS; ^^^^^^^^. :program:`llvm-profdata overlap` [*options*] [*base profile file*] [*test profile file*]. DESCRIPTION; ^^^^^^^^^^^. :program:`llvm-profdata overlap` takes two profile data files and displays the; *overlap* of counter distribution between the whole files and between any of the; specified functions. In this command, *overlap* is defined as follows:; Suppose *base profile file* has the following counts:; {c1_1, c1_2, ..., c1_n, c1_u_1, c2_u_2, ..., c2_u_s},; and *test profile file* has; {c2_1, c2_2, ..., c2_n, c2_v_1, c2_v_2, ..., c2_v_t}.; Here c{1|2}_i (i = 1 .. n) are matched counters and c1_u_i (i = 1 .. s) and; c2_v_i (i = 1 .. v) are unmatched counters (or counters only existing in); *base profile file* and *test profile file*, respectively.; Let sum_1 = c1_1 + c1_2 + ... + c1_n + c1_u_1 + c2_u_2 + ... + c2_u_s, and; sum_2 = c2_1 + c2_2 + ... + c2_n + c2_v_1 + c2_v_2 + ... + c2_v_t.; *overlap* = min(c1_1/sum_1, c2_1/sum_2) + min(c1_2/sum_1, c2_2/sum_2) + ...; + min(c1_n/sum_1, c2_n/sum_2). The result overlap distribution is a percentage number, ranging from 0.0% to; 100.0%, where 0.0% means there is no overlap and 100.0% means a perfect; overlap. Here is an example, if *base profile file* has counts of {400, 600}, and; *test profile file* has matched counts of {60000, 40000}. The *overlap* is 80%.

The minimum quality standards that any change must satisfy before being; committed to the main development branch are:. #. Code must adhere to the `LLVM Coding Standards <CodingStandards.html>`_. #. Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one platform. #. Bug fixes and new features should `include a testcase`_ so we know if the; fix/feature ever regresses in the future. #. Code must pass the ``llvm/test`` test suite. #. The code must not cause regressions on a reasonable subset of llvm-test,; where ""reasonable"" depends on the contributor's judgement and the scope of; the change (more invasive changes require more testing). A reasonable subset; might be something like ""``llvm-test/MultiSource/Benchmarks``"". #.

The surrounding comments should be sufficient; to provide the context behind such links.

Your JIT can choose which one of these definitions will be; used when the ``log`` symbol is referenced by setting up an alias at JIT startup; time:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. auto LogImplementationSymbol =; Verbose ? Mangle(""log_detailed"") : Mangle(""log_fast"");. JITStdLibJD.define(; symbolAliases(SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""log""),; { LogImplementationSymbol; JITSymbolFlags::Exported | JITSymbolFlags::Callable } }; });. The ``symbolAliases`` function allows you to define aliases within a single; JITDylib. The ``reexports`` function provides the same functionality, but; operates across JITDylib boundaries. E.g. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD1 = ... ;; auto &JD2 = ... ;. // Make 'bar' in JD2 an alias for 'foo' from JD1.; JD2.define(; reexports(JD1, SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""bar""), { Mangle(""foo""), JITSymbolFlags::Exported } }; });. The reexports utility can be handy for composing a single JITDylib interface by; re-exporting symbols from several other JITDylibs. .. _Laziness:. Laziness; ========.

HLSL ``this`` Keyword; ---------------------. HLSL does support member functions, and (in HLSL 2021) limited operator; overloading. With member function support, HLSL also has a ``this`` keyword. The; ``this`` keyword is an example of one of the places where HLSL relies on; references in the AST, because ``this`` is a reference. Bitshifts; ---------. In deviation from C, HLSL bitshifts are defined to mask the shift count by the; size of the type. In DXC, the semantics of LLVM IR were altered to accommodate; this, in Clang we intend to generate the mask explicitly in the IR. In cases; where the shift value is constant, this will be constant folded appropriately,; in other cases we can clean it up in the DXIL target. Non-short Circuiting Logical Operators; --------------------------------------. In HLSL 2018 and earlier, HLSL supported logical operators (and the ternary; operator) on vector types. This behavior required that operators not short; circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until HLSL; 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector types; instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are available, and; operators short circuit matching C behavior. Precise Qualifier; -----------------. HLSL has a ``precise`` qualifier that behaves unlike anything else in the C; language. The support for this qualifier in DXC is buggy, so our bar for; compatibility is low. The ``precise`` qualifier applies in the inverse direction from normal; qualifiers. Rather than signifying that the declaration containing ``precise``; qualifier be precise, it signifies that the operations contributing to the; declaration's value be ``precise``. Additionally, ``precise`` is a misnomer:; values attributed as ``precise`` comply with IEEE-754 floating point semantics,; and are prevented ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:7604,log,logical,7604,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

Create Release Branch; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Branch the Git trunk using the following procedure:. #. Remind developers that the release branching is imminent and to refrain from; committing patches that might break the build. E.g., new features, large; patches for works in progress, an overhaul of the type system, an exciting; new TableGen feature, etc. #. Verify that the current git trunk is in decent shape by; examining nightly tester and buildbot results. #. Bump the version in trunk to N.0.0git and tag the commit with llvmorg-N-init.; If ``X`` is the version to be released, then ``N`` is ``X + 1``. ::. $ git tag -sa llvmorg-N-init. #. Clear the release notes in trunk. #. Create the release branch from the last known good revision from before the; version bump. The branch's name is release/X.x where ``X`` is the major version; number and ``x`` is just the letter ``x``. #. On the newly-created release branch, immediately bump the version; to X.1.0git (where ``X`` is the major version of the branch.). #. All tags and branches need to be created in both the llvm/llvm-project and; llvm/llvm-test-suite repos. Update LLVM Version; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2.

So, if you're testing for a behaviour that you know is platform-specific or; depends on special features of sub-architectures, you must add the specific; triple, test with the specific FileCheck and put it into the specific; directory that will filter out all other architectures.

The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it. In order to test the post register allocation; pseudo instruction expansion pass on X86-64, a run line like the one shown; below can be used:. ``# RUN: llc -o - %s -mtriple=x86_64-- -run-pass=postrapseudos | FileCheck %s``. The MIR files are target dependent, so they have to be placed in the target; specific test directories (``lib/CodeGen/TARGETNAME``). They also need to; specify a target triple or a target architecture either in the run line or in; the embedded LLVM IR module. Simplifying MIR files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The MIR code coming out of ``-stop-after``/``-stop-before`` is very verbose;; Tests are more accessible and future proof when simplified:. - Use the ``-simplify-mir`` option with llc. - Machine function attributes often have default values or the test works just; as well with default values.

Testability,"ement; -------------------------------------. Expressions and statements are one of the most fundamental constructs within a; compiler, because they interact with many different parts of the AST, semantic; analysis, and IR generation. Therefore, adding a new expression or statement; kind into Clang requires some care. The following list details the various; places in Clang where an expression or statement needs to be introduced, along; with patterns to follow to ensure that the new expression or statement works; well across all of the C languages. We focus on expressions, but statements; are similar. #. Introduce parsing actions into the parser. Recursive-descent parsing is; mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few things that are worth keeping; in mind:. * Keep as much source location information as possible! You'll want it later; to produce great diagnostics and support Clang's various features that map; between source code and the AST.; * Write tests for all of the ""bad"" parsing cases, to make sure your recovery; is good. If you have matched delimiters (e.g., parentheses, square; brackets, etc.), use ``Parser::BalancedDelimiterTracker`` to give nice; diagnostics when things go wrong. #. Introduce semantic analysis actions into ``Sema``. Semantic analysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant.

Testability,"ementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object.

Testability,"en it and the previous directive. A ""``CHECK-NEXT:``"" cannot be; the first directive in a file. The ""CHECK-SAME:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes you want to match lines and would like to verify that matches happen; on the same line as the previous match. In this case, you can use ""``CHECK:``""; and ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives to specify this. If you specified a custom; check prefix, just use ""``<PREFIX>-SAME:``"". ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is particularly powerful in conjunction with ""``CHECK-NOT:``""; (described below). For example, the following works like you'd expect:. .. code-block:: llvm. !0 = !DILocation(line: 5, scope: !1, inlinedAt: !2). ; CHECK: !DILocation(line: 5,; ; CHECK-NOT: column:; ; CHECK-SAME: scope: ![[SCOPE:[0-9]+]]. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives reject the input if there are any newlines between; it and the previous directive. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is also useful to avoid writing matchers for irrelevant; fields. For example, suppose you're writing a test which parses a tool that; generates output like this:. .. code-block:: text. Name: foo; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. Name: bar; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 2. Name: baz; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. To write a test that verifies ``foo`` has the value ``1``, you might first; write this:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value: 1{{$}}. However, this would be a bad test: if the value for ``foo`` changes, the test; would still pass because the ""``CHECK: Value: 1``"" line would match the value; from ``baz``. To fix this, you could add ``CHECK-NEXT`` matchers for every; ``FieldN:`` line, but that would be verbose, and need to be updated when; ``Field4`` is added. A more succinct way to write the test using the; ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" matcher would be as follows:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value:; CHECK-SAME: {{ 1$}}. This verifies that the *next* time ""``Value:``"" appears in the output, it has; the value ``1``.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:15016,test,test,15016,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,1,['test'],['test']

'``coro.outside.frame``' Metadata; ---------------------------------. ``coro.outside.frame`` metadata may be attached to an alloca instruction to; to signify that it shouldn't be promoted to the coroutine frame, useful for; filtering allocas out by the frontend when emitting internal control mechanisms.; Additionally, this metadata is only used as a flag, so the associated; node must be empty. .. code-block:: text. %__coro_gro = alloca %struct.GroType, align 1, !coro.outside.frame !0. ...; !0 = !{}.

When coro.suspend returns -1, the coroutine is suspended, and it's possible; that the coroutine has already been destroyed (hence the frame has been freed).; We cannot access anything on the frame on the suspend path.; However there is nothing that prevents the compiler from moving instructions; along that path (e.g. LICM), which can lead to use-after-free. At the moment; we disabled LICM for loops that have coro.suspend, but the general problem still; exists and requires a general solution. #. Take advantage of the lifetime intrinsics for the data that goes into the; coroutine frame. Leave lifetime intrinsics as is for the data that stays in; allocas. #. The CoroElide optimization pass relies on coroutine ramp function to be; inlined. It would be beneficial to split the ramp function further to; increase the chance that it will get inlined into its caller. #. Design a convention that would make it possible to apply coroutine heap; elision optimization across ABI boundaries. #.

Clang can be used to compile OpenCL kernels for execution on a device; (e.g. GPU). It is possible to compile the kernel into a binary (e.g. for AMDGPU); that can be uploaded to run directly on a device (e.g. using; `clCreateProgramWithBinary; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf#111>`_) or; into generic bitcode files loadable into other toolchains. Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl. Compiling to bitcode can be done as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -c -emit-llvm test.cl. This will produce a file `test.bc` that can be used in vendor toolchains; to perform machine code generation. Note that if compiled to bitcode for generic targets such as SPIR/SPIR-V,; portable IR is produced that can be used with various vendor; tools as well as open source tools such as `SPIRV-LLVM Translator; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_; to produce SPIR-V binary.

Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> col:15 used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>. With Recovery AST, the AST looks like:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>; `-RecoveryExpr <line:3:3, col:12> 'int' contains-errors; |-UnresolvedLookupExpr <col:3> '<overloaded function type>' lvalue (ADL) = 'NoArg'; `-DeclRefExpr <col:9> 'int' lvalue ParmVar 'abc' 'int'. An alternative is to use existing Exprs, e.g. CallExpr for the above example.; This would capture more call details (e.g. locations of parentheses) and allow; it to be treated uniformly with valid CallExprs. However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong.

Testability,"ent at CERN. NA49; has generated an impressive amount of data, around 10 Terabytes per; run. This rate provided the ideal environment to develop and test the; next generation data analysis. ROOT was, and still is, developed in the ""Bazaar style"", a term from; the book ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" by Eric S. Raymond. It means a; liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse; and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists; developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate,; useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of; ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with; the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming; co-developers. When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics; plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow; close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time. They are; ready to use the true and tested technologies physics has invented. In; this way, other fields and industries have found ROOT useful and they; have started to use it also. In the bazaar view, software is released early and frequently to; expose it to thousands of eager co-developers to pound on, report; bugs, and contribute possible fixes. More users find more bugs,; because they stress the program in different ways. By now, after ten; years, the age of ROOT is quite mature.

Testability,"ent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

OpenCL Specific Options; -----------------------. In addition to the options described in :doc:`UsersManual` there are the; following options specific to the OpenCL frontend. All the options in this section are frontend-only and therefore if used; with regular clang driver they require frontend forwarding, e.g. ``-cc1``; or ``-Xclang``. .. _opencl_finclude_default_header:. .. option:: -finclude-default-header. Adds most of builtin types and function declarations during compilations. By; default the OpenCL headers are not loaded by the frontend and therefore certain; builtin types and most of builtin functions are not declared. To load them; automatically this flag can be passed to the frontend (see also :ref:`the; section on the OpenCL Header <opencl_header>`):. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -Xclang -finclude-default-header test.cl. Alternatively the internal header `opencl-c.h` containing the declarations; can be included manually using ``-include`` or ``-I`` followed by the path; to the header location. The header can be found in the clang source tree or; installation directory. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -I<path to clang sources>/lib/Headers/opencl-c.h test.cl; $ clang -I<path to clang installation>/lib/clang/<llvm version>/include/opencl-c.h/opencl-c.h test.cl.

Testability,"ent is a reference manual for the Machine IR (MIR) serialization; format. MIR is a human readable serialization format that is used to represent; LLVM's :ref:`machine specific intermediate representation; <machine code representation>`. The MIR serialization format is designed to be used for testing the code; generation passes in LLVM. Overview; ========. The MIR serialization format uses a YAML container. YAML is a standard; data serialization language, and the full YAML language spec can be read at; `yaml.org; <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction>`_. A MIR file is split up into a series of `YAML documents`_. The first document; can contain an optional embedded LLVM IR module, and the rest of the documents; contain the serialized machine functions. .. _YAML documents: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132. MIR Testing Guide; =================. You can use the MIR format for testing in two different ways:. - You can write MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``.

Testability,"ented by adjusting such functions to either encrypt the stack pointer when; storing it in the heap (as already done e.g., by ``setjmp``/``longjmp``; implementation in glibc), or store it in a safe region instead. The `CPI paper <https://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf>`_ describes two alternative,; stronger safe stack protection mechanisms, that rely on software fault; isolation, or hardware segmentation (as available on x86-32 and some x86-64; CPUs). At the moment, SafeStack assumes that the compiler's implementation is correct.; This has not been verified except through manual code inspection, and could; always regress in the future. It's therefore desirable to have a separate; static or dynamic binary verification tool that would check the correctness of; the SafeStack instrumentation in final binaries. Usage; =====.

Testability,"entially create; this would have to ensure that it doesn't, and there is valid code that can; create this sort of construct (in dead code). The sorts of things that can; cause this to happen are fairly contrived, but we still need to accept them.; Here's an example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define internal void @bar(void()* %FP, i1 %cond) {; br i1 %cond, label %T, label %F; T:; call void %FP(); ret void; F:; call fastcc void %FP(); ret void; }; define void @test() {; %X = or i1 false, false; call void @bar(void()* @foo, i1 %X); ret void; }. In this example, ""test"" always passes ``@foo``/``false`` into ``bar``, which; ensures that it is dynamically called with the right calling conv (thus, the; code is perfectly well defined). If you run this through the inliner, you; get this (the explicit ""or"" is there so that the inliner doesn't dead code; eliminate a bunch of stuff):. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define void @test() {; %X = or i1 false, false; br i1 %X, label %T.i, label %F.i; T.i:; call void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; F.i:; call fastcc void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; bar.exit:; ret void; }. Here you can see that the inlining pass made an undefined call to ``@foo``; with the wrong calling convention. We really don't want to make the inliner; have to know about this sort of thing, so it needs to be valid code. In this; case, dead code elimination can trivially remove the undefined code. However,; if ``%X`` was an input argument to ``@test``, the inliner would produce this:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }. define void @test(i1 %X) {; br i1 %X, label %T.i, label %F.i; T.i:; call void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; F.i:; call fastcc void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; bar.exit:; ret void; }.

Testability,"er files that are global to your; project. By global, we mean that they are used by more than one library or; executable of your project. By placing your header files in **include**, they will be found; automatically by the LLVM build system. For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own. Typically, you will want to build your **lib** directory first followed by your; **tools** directory. Writing LLVM Style Makefiles; ============================.

Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below).

Which adds this to the output of our program:. ::. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); ...; -max-file-size=<size> - Maximum file size to accept. And we can test that our parse works correctly now (the test program just prints; out the max-file-size argument value):. ::. $ ./test; MFS: 0; $ ./test -max-file-size=123MB; MFS: 128974848; $ ./test -max-file-size=3G; MFS: 3221225472; $ ./test -max-file-size=dog; -max-file-size option: 'dog' value invalid for file size argument!. It looks like it works. The error message that we get is nice and helpful, and; we seem to accept reasonable file sizes. This wraps up the ""custom parser""; tutorial. Exploiting external storage; ---------------------------. Several of the LLVM libraries define static ``cl::opt`` instances that will; automatically be included in any program that links with that library. This is; a feature. However, sometimes it is necessary to know the value of the command; line option outside of the library. In these cases the library does or should; provide an external storage location that is accessible to users of the; library. Examples of this include the ``llvm::DebugFlag`` exported by the; ``lib/Support/Debug.cpp`` file and the ``llvm::TimePassesIsEnabled`` flag; exported by the ``lib/IR/PassManager.cpp`` file. .. todo::.

This behavior required that operators not short; circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until HLSL; 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector types; instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are available, and; operators short circuit matching C behavior. Precise Qualifier; -----------------. HLSL has a ``precise`` qualifier that behaves unlike anything else in the C; language. The support for this qualifier in DXC is buggy, so our bar for; compatibility is low. The ``precise`` qualifier applies in the inverse direction from normal; qualifiers. Rather than signifying that the declaration containing ``precise``; qualifier be precise, it signifies that the operations contributing to the; declaration's value be ``precise``. Additionally, ``precise`` is a misnomer:; values attributed as ``precise`` comply with IEEE-754 floating point semantics,; and are prevented from optimizations which could decrease *or increase*; precision. Differences in Templates; ------------------------. HLSL uses templates to define builtin types and methods, but disallowed; user-defined templates until HLSL 2021. HLSL also allows omitting empty template; parameter lis",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:7817,log,logical,7817,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

The ``exhaustive`` attribute implies that any macro definitions; for macros not listed as configuration macros should be ignored; completely when building the module. As an optimization, the; compiler could reduce the number of unique module variants by not; considering these non-configuration macros. This optimization is not; yet implemented in Clang. A translation unit shall not import the same module under different definitions of the configuration macros. .. note::. Clang implements a weak form of this requirement: the definitions; used for configuration macros are fixed based on the definitions; provided by the command line. If an import occurs and the definition; of any configuration macro has changed, the compiler will produce a; warning (under the control of ``-Wconfig-macros``). **Example:** A logging library might provide different API (e.g., in the form of different definitions for a logging macro) based on the ``NDEBUG`` macro setting:. .. parsed-literal::. module MyLogger {; umbrella header ""MyLogger.h""; config_macros [exhaustive] NDEBUG; }.

Using Ninja Build System; =======================================. Optionally you can use the `Ninja`_ build system instead of make. It is; aimed at making your builds faster. Currently this step will require; building Ninja from sources. To take advantage of using Clang Tools along with Ninja build you need; at least CMake 2.8.9. Clone the Ninja git repository and build Ninja from sources:. .. code-block:: console. $ git clone git://github.com/martine/ninja.git; $ cd ninja/; $ ./bootstrap.py. This will result in a single binary ``ninja`` in the current directory.; It doesn't require installation and can just be copied to any location; inside ``$PATH``, say ``/usr/local/bin/``:. .. code-block:: console. $ sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin/; $ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ninja. After doing all of this, you'll need to generate Ninja build files for; LLVM with CMake. You need to make a build directory and run CMake from; it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables in an interactive manner. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using Ninja:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja check-all.

Testability,"er:. > [Automatic Differentiation of Binned Likelihoods with RooFit and Clad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02650). ## Overview on RooFit implementation details to access source code transformation AD. In RooFit jargon, what is meant by a ""RooFit class"" is a class inheriting from; RooAbsArg that represents a mathematical function, a PDF, or any other; transformation of inputs that are also represented by RooAbsArg objects.; Almost all final classes deriving from RooAbsArg have RooAbsReal as an; intermediate base class, which is the base class for all RooAbsArg that; represent real-valued nodes in the computation graph.; As such RooFit objects are so prevalent in practice, the names RooAbsArg and; RooAbsReal are used interchangeably in this guide. Users take these classes to build a computational graph that represents the; PDF (also called ""model"") that they want to use for fitting the data.; The user then passes his final PDF and a RooAbsData object to the; RooAbsPdf::fitTo() method, which implicitly creates a negative-log likelihood; (NLL) that RooFit minimizes for parameter estimation.; The NLL object, internally created by RooAbsPdf::createNLL(), is a RooAbsArg; itself.; In technical terms, it's another larger computation graph that encompasses the; computation graph representing the PDF. To enable source code transformation AD for RooFit NLLs with Clad, RooFit has a; routine that can traverse a computation graph made of RooAbsArg objects and; transform it to much simpler C++ code that mathematically represents the same; computation, but without any overhead that is hard to digest by the AD tool. On a high level, this *code generation* is implemented as follows:. 1. The computation graph is visited recursively by a; RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext object, via the virtual; RooAbsArg::translate() function that implements the translation of a; given RooFit class to minimal C++ code. This is an example of the visitor; pattern. 2.

The changes with respect to ROOT 5.27 / TMVA 4.0.7 are; in detail:. Framework. Multi-class support. The support of multiple; output classes (i.e., more than a single background and signal; class) has been enabled for these methods: MLP (NN), BDTG,; FDA.; The multiclass; functionality can be enabled with the Factory option; ""AnalysisType=multiclass"". Training data is; specified with an additional classname, e.g. via; factory->AddTree(tree,""classname"");. After the; training a genetic algorithm is invoked to determine the best; cuts for selecting a specific class, based on the figure of; merit: purity*efficiency. TMVA comes with two examples in; $ROOTSYS/tmva/test: TMVAMulticlass.C; and TMVAMulticlassApplication.C. New TMVA event vector building. The code; for splitting the input data into training and test samples for; all classes and the mixing of those samples to one training and; one test sample has been rewritten completely. The new code is; more performant and has a clearer structure. This fixes several; bugs which have been reported by some users of TMVA.; Code and performance test framework: A unit; test framework for daily software and method performance; validation has been implemented.; . Methods. BDT Automatic parameter optimisation for building the; tree architecture: The optimisation procedure uses the; performance of the trained classifier on the ""test sample"" for; finding the set of optimal parameters. Two different methods to; traverse the parameter space are available (scanning, genetic; algorithm).

Assert Liberally; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use the ""``assert``"" macro to its fullest. Check all of your preconditions and; assumptions, you never know when a bug (not necessarily even yours) might be; caught early by an assertion, which reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");.

Testability,"erializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system. A column contains; an arbitrary number of fixed-sized elements of a well-defined set of types: integers and floats of different; bit sizes. A C++ type may be mapped to multiple columns. For instance, an `std::vector<float>` maps to two columns,; an offset column indicating the size of the vector per entry, and a payload column with the float data. Columns are partitioned into **pages** (roughly: TTree baskets) of a few kB -- a few tens of kB each.; The **physical layer** (only) needs to provide the means to store and retrieve pages. The physical layer is; decoupled from the high-level C++ logic. The physical layer implements an abstract page storage interface,; so that dedicated implementations for key-value stores and other storage systems are conceivable.; At this point, the only provided backend stores the pages in ROOT files. RNTuples are further grouped into **clusters**, which are, like TTree clusters, self-contained blocks of; consecutive entries. Clusters provide a unit of writing and will provide the means for parallel writing of data; in a future version of RNTuple.

Although it has some holes (it allows ""``123KKK``"" for example),; it is good enough for this example. Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below). Now that we have our parser class, we can; use it like this:. .. code-block:: c++. static cl::opt<unsigned, false, FileSizeParser>; MFS(""max-file-size"", cl::desc(""Maximum file size to accept""),; cl::value_desc(""size""));. Which adds this to the output of our program:. ::. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); ...; -max-file-size=<size> - Maximum file size to accept. And we can test that our parse works correctly now (the test program just prints; out the max-file-size argument value):. ::. $ ./test; MFS: 0; $ ./test -max-file-size=123MB; MFS: 128974848; $ ./test -max-file-size=3G; MFS: 3221225472; $ ./test -max-file-size=dog; -max-file-size option: 'dog' value invalid for file size argument!.

Several of the LLVM libraries define static ``cl::opt`` instances that will; automatically be included in any program that links with that library. This is; a feature.

Checks and asserts that alter the LLVM C++ ABI are predicated on the; preprocessor symbol `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` -- LLVM; libraries built with `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` are not ABI; compatible LLVM libraries built without it defined. By default,; turning on assertions also turns on `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS`; so a default +Asserts build is not ABI compatible with a; default -Asserts build. Clients that want ABI compatibility; between +Asserts and -Asserts builds should use the CMake build system; to set `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` independently; of `LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`. .. _coreclasses:.

The Core LLVM classes are the primary means of representing the program being; inspected or transformed. The core LLVM classes are defined in header files in; the ``include/llvm/IR`` directory, and implemented in the ``lib/IR``; directory.

You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled.

The; expectation is that the information collected from contextual elements; (described below) in the logging stream may be necessary to decode the content; of the dump.

However, the information they impart may be essential to; understanding the logging text even after symbolization. So it's recommended; that this information be preserved in some form when the original raw log with; markup may no longer be readily accessible for whatever reason. Contextual elements should appear in the logging stream before they are needed.; That is, if some piece of context may affect how the symbolizing filter would; interpret or present a later presentation element, the necessary contextual; elements should have appeared somewhere earlier in the logging stream.

This must be a trivial immediate integer or floating-point; constant. Undef or constant expressions are not valid.

The test mask has the same format as the; second argument to the :ref:`llvm.is.fpclass <llvm.is.fpclass>`,; and indicates which classes of floating-point values are not; permitted for the value. For example a bitmask of 3 indicates; the parameter may not be a NaN. If the value is a floating-point class indicated by the; ``nofpclass`` test mask, a :ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>` is; passed or returned instead. .. code-block:: text; :caption: The following invariants hold. @llvm.is.fpclass(nofpclass(test_mask) %x, test_mask) => false; @llvm.is.fpclass(nofpclass(test_mask) %x, ~test_mask) => true; nofpclass(all) => poison; ..

Returning a value allows for chained; assignments like ""X = (Y = Z)"". Now that we have an assignment operator, we can mutate loop variables; and arguments. For example, we can now run code like this:. ::. # Function to print a double.; extern printd(x);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. def test(x); printd(x) :; x = 4 :; printd(x);. test(123);.

An optimal (i.e. giving the; highest speed-up) number can be calculated analytically under simple; assumptions.; Merging via submergers is by default disabled. To enable it, with the; optimal number of sub-mergers, one should set the integer parameter; 'PROOF_UseMergers' to 0, i.e.                     ; proof->SetParameter(""PROOF_UseMergers"", 0). To force S sub-mergers (regardless of the optimal number) do.                     ; proof->SetParameter(""PROOF_UseMergers"", S).

Testability,"esign Document; ==============================================. .. contents::; :local:. Objective; =========. This document provides an overview of an external tool to verify the protection; mechanisms implemented by Clang's *Control Flow Integrity* (CFI) schemes; (``-fsanitize=cfi``). This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form. This tool should also be added as part of Clang's continuous integration testing; framework, where modifications to the compiler ensure that CFI protection; schemes are still present in the final binary. Location; ========. This tool will be present as a part of the LLVM toolchain, and will reside in; the ""/llvm/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"" directory, relative to the LLVM trunk. It will; be tested in two methods:. - Unit tests to validate code sections, present in; ""/llvm/unittests/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"".; - Integration tests, present in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"". These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary.

In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed. For example:. > [roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx). > Tip: Tests like above can be referenced to see which parts of RooFit already; support AD. ### How do I control my compile time?.

Testability,"est whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing. But if we claim support; for a feature that has significant bugs, we've eliminated most of the utility; of having a feature testing macro at all because users are then forced to test; what compiler version is in use to get a more accurate answer. The status reported by the feature test macro should always be reflected in the; language support page for the corresponding feature (`C++; <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html>`_, `C; <https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html>`_) if applicable.

Testability,"est/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing.

The interesting-ness test would be defined as a script that returns 0 when the; IR achieves a user-defined behaviour (e.g. failure to compile on clang) and a; nonzero value when otherwise. Leaving the user the freedom to determine what is; and isn’t interesting to the tool, and thus, streamlining the process of; reducing a test-case. If the test accepts any arguments (excluding the input ll/bc file), they are; given via the following flag:; `--test_args=<test_arguments>`; If unspecified, the test is run as given. It’s worth noting that the input file; would be passed as a parameter to the test, similar how `-compile-custom`; currently operates. ### Implementation; The tool would behave similar to CReduce’s functionality in that it would have a; list of passes that try to minimize the given test-case. We should be able to; modularize the tool’s behavior, as well as making it easier to maintain and; expand. The first version of this redesign would try to:. * Discard functions, instructions and metadata that don’t influence the; interesting-ness test; * Remove unused parameters from functions; * Eliminate unvisited conditional paths; * Rename variables to more regular ones (such as “a”, “b”, “c”, etc.). Once these passes are implemented, more meaningful reductions (such as type; reduction) would be added to the tool, to even further reduce IR. ## Background on historical bugpoint issues. ### Root Cause Analysis; Presently, bugpoint takes a long time to find the source problem in a given IR; file, mainly due to the fact that it tries to debug the input by running; various strategies to classify the bug, which in turn run multiple optimizer; and compilation passes over the input, taking up a lot of time.

Recommended for; simple file formats such as ntuples but not more complex data types. To; enable, invoke `tree->SetBit(TTree::kOnlyFlushAtCluster)`. ## Histogram Libraries. ## Math Libraries. ### [Clad](https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad); - Enable experimental automatic differentiation techniques to compute; derivatives and gradients of functions. Automatic differentiation is; superior to the slow symbolic or often inaccurate numerical differentiation.; It uses the fact that every computer program can be divided into a set of; elementary operations (-,+,*,/) and functions (sin, cos, log, etc). By; applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of; arbitrary order can be computed.; - Implement experimental `TFormula::GradientPar` derivative engine which; employs clad. ### VecOps; - Add `All` helper: return true if all of the elements equate to true, return false otherwise.; - Add `Any` helper: return true if any of the elements equates to true, return false otherwise.; - Add `ArgSort` helper: return an RVec of indices that sort the vector.; - Add `Combinations` helper which can:; - return the indices which represent all combinations of the elements of two vectors.; - return the indices which represent all unique n-tuple combinations of the elements of a given vector.; - Add `Intersect` helper: return the intersection of elements of two RVecs.; - Add `Nonzero` helper: return the indices of the elements which are not zero; - Add `Reverse` helepr: return copy of reversed RVec.; - Add `S",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v616/index.md:11300,log,log,11300,README/ReleaseNotes/v616/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v616/index.md,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"ey in; turn move up their own inheritance tree and so forth. The simple data; members are written to the buffer directly. Eventually the buffer; contains all simple data members of all the classes that make up this; particular object. Data members that are references (as; `MyClass &fObj;`) are never saved, it is always the responsibility of; the object's constructor to set them properly. ### Automatically Generated Streamers. A `Streamer `usually calls other `Streamers`: the `Streamer `of its; parents and data members. This architecture depends on all classes; having `Streamers`, because eventually they will be called. To ensure; that a class has a `Streamer`, `rootcling` automatically creates one in; the `ClassDef` macro that is defined in `$ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h`.; `ClassDef` defines several methods for any class, and one of them is the; `Streamer`. The automatically generated `Streamer `is complete and can; be used as long as no customization is needed. The `Event` class is defined in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.h`. Looking at the; class definition, we find that it inherits from **`TObject`**. It is a; simple example of a class with diverse data members. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; TDirectory *fTransient; //! current directory; Float_t fPt; //! transient value; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr; //|| don't split; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; ...; ```. The Event class is added to the dictionary by the `rootcling`; utility. This is the `rootcling` statement in the; `$ROOTSYS/test/Makefile`:. ``` {.cpp}; @rootcling -f EventDict.cxx -c Event.h EventLinkDef.h; ```. The `EventDict.cxx` file contains the automatically generated; `Streamer `for Event:. ``` {.cpp}; void Event::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b){; // Stream an object of class Event.; if (R__b.IsReading()) {;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:44147,test,test,44147,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['test'],['test']

We follow with the previous examples; in LLVM IR while also providing a graphical representation; of the control-flow graphs (CFG). You can get the same graphical; results by utilizing the :ref:`view-cfg <passes-view-cfg>` pass.

The ``STATISTIC`` macro defines a static variable, whose name is specified by; the first argument.

Whenever you make a transformation, bump the counter:. .. code-block:: c++. ++NumXForms; // I did stuff!. That's all you have to do.

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:20295,assert,assertions,20295,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,3,['assert'],"['assertion', 'assertions']"

Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each; object) the scale setting in each `Paint` method of all objects should; be tested. If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of; the histograms frame will convince you. The `SetLogx()`, `SetLogy()` and; `SetLogz()` methods are there. As you see, **`TPad`** defines log scale; for the two directions `x` and `y` plus `z` if you want to draw a 3D; representation of some function or histogram. The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); ```. To reset log in the z direction:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); ```. If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the; sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically; propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log; scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); ```. ### WaitPrimitive method.

For detailed case scenarios, such as debugging ``opt``, or one of the LLVM code; generators, see :doc:`HowToSubmitABug`. Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work. Because of this, it may; appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications. ``bugpoint`` is; also designed to trade off programmer time for computer time in the; compiler-debugging process; consequently, it may take a long period of; (unattended) time to reduce a test case, but we feel it is still worth it. Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program. If any; LLVM passes are specified on the command line, it runs these passes on the test; program. If any of the passes crash, or if they produce malformed output (which; causes the verifier to abort), ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_. Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output.

Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on.

Adding a volume named A with a given `user id`; inside a volume B will create a node named `A_id.` This will be added to; the list of nodes stored by B. In addition, when applying a division; operation in N slices to a volume A, a list of nodes `B_1`, `B_2`, ... ,; `B_N` is also created. A node `B_i` does not represent a unique object; in the geometry because its container A might be at its turn positioned; as node inside several other volumes.

Testability,"f production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible. The collection of all guarded slots makes up the *guarded; allocation pool*.

Once all equivalence classes are formed, the map can be compressed so each; integer 0..n-1 maps to an equivalence class number in the range 0..m-1, where m; is the total number of equivalence classes. The map must be uncompressed before; it can be edited again. .. _dss_immutablemap:. llvm/ADT/ImmutableMap.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ImmutableMap is an immutable (functional) map implementation based on an AVL; tree. Adding or removing elements is done through a Factory object and results; in the creation of a new ImmutableMap object. If an ImmutableMap already exists; with the given key set, then the existing one is returned; equality is compared; with a FoldingSetNodeID. The time and space complexity of add or remove; operations is logarithmic in the size of the original map. .. _dss_othermap:. Other Map-Like Container Options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The STL provides several other options, such as std::multimap and; std::unordered_map. We never use containers like unordered_map because; they are generally very expensive (each insertion requires a malloc). std::multimap is useful if you want to map a key to multiple values, but has all; the drawbacks of std::map. A sorted vector or some other approach is almost; always better. .. _ds_bit:. Bit storage containers; ------------------------------------------------------------------------. There are several bit storage containers, and choosing when to use each is; relatively straightforward.

Testability,"f>`_. Introduction; ============. Clang's AST is different from ASTs produced by some other compilers in; that it closely resembles both the written C++ code and the C++; standard. For example, parenthesis expressions and compile time; constants are available in an unreduced form in the AST. This makes; Clang's AST a good fit for refactoring tools. Documentation for all Clang AST nodes is available via the generated; `Doxygen <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen>`_. The doxygen online; documentation is also indexed by your favorite search engine, which will; make a search for clang and the AST node's class name usually turn up; the doxygen of the class you're looking for (for example, search for:; clang ParenExpr). Examining the AST; =================. A good way to familiarize yourself with the Clang AST is to actually look; at it on some simple example code. Clang has a builtin AST-dump mode,; which can be enabled with the flag ``-ast-dump``. Let's look at a simple example AST:. ::. $ cat test.cc; int f(int x) {; int result = (x / 42);; return result;; }. # Clang by default is a frontend for many tools; -Xclang is used to pass; # options directly to the C++ frontend.; $ clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only test.cc; TranslationUnitDecl 0x5aea0d0 <<invalid sloc>>; ... cutting out internal declarations of clang ...; `-FunctionDecl 0x5aeab50 <test.cc:1:1, line:4:1> f 'int (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl 0x5aeaa90 <line:1:7, col:11> x 'int'; `-CompoundStmt 0x5aead88 <col:14, line:4:1>; |-DeclStmt 0x5aead10 <line:2:3, col:24>; | `-VarDecl 0x5aeac10 <col:3, col:23> result 'int'; | `-ParenExpr 0x5aeacf0 <col:16, col:23> 'int'; | `-BinaryOperator 0x5aeacc8 <col:17, col:21> 'int' '/'; | |-ImplicitCastExpr 0x5aeacb0 <col:17> 'int' <LValueToRValue>; | | `-DeclRefExpr 0x5aeac68 <col:17> 'int' lvalue ParmVar 0x5aeaa90 'x' 'int'; | `-IntegerLiteral 0x5aeac90 <col:21> 'int' 42; `-ReturnStmt 0x5aead68 <line:3:3, col:10>; `-ImplicitCastExpr 0x5aead50 <col:10> 'int' <LValueToRValue>; `-DeclRefExp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst:1533,test,test,1533,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst,1,['test'],['test']

When comparing logical views created from different debug formats, its; accuracy depends on how close the debug information represents the; user code. For instance, a logical view created from a binary file with; DWARF debug information may include more detailed data than a logical; view created from a binary file with CodeView/COFF debug information.

With these modifications in place we can selectively test functions in an object; file by mocking those function's callees. For example, suppose we have an object; file, ``test_code.o``, compiled from the following C source (which we need not; have access to):. .. code-block:: c. void irrelevant_function() { irrelevant_external(); }. int function_to_mock(int X) {; return /* some function of X */;; }. static void function_to_test() {; ...; int Y = function_to_mock();; printf(""Y is %i\n"", Y);; }. If we want to know how ``function_to_test`` behaves when we change the behavior; of ``function_to_mock`` we can test it by writing a test harness:. .. code-block:: c. void function_to_test();. int function_to_mock(int X) {; printf(""used mock utility function\n"");; return 42;; }. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; function_to_test():; return 0;; }. Under normal circumstances these objects could not be linked together:; ``function_to_test`` is static and could not be resolved outside; ``test_code.o``, the two ``function_to_mock`` functions would result in a; duplicate definition error, and ``irrelevant_external`` is undefined.; However, using ``-harness`` and ``-phony-externals`` we can run this code; with:. .. code-block:: sh. % clang -c -o test_code_harness.o test_code_harness.c; % llvm-jitlink -phony-externals test_code.o -harness test_code_harness.o; used mock utility function; Y is 42.

It typically contains small utility functions. For; example, the `rootalias.C` script that comes with the ROOT; distributions (located in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials)` defines the function; `edit(char *file)`. This allows the user to call the editor from the; command line. This particular function will start the VI editor if the; environment variable `EDITOR` is not set. ``` {.cpp}; root[0] edit(""c1.C""); ```. For more details, see `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/rootalias.C`. ### History File. You can use the up and down arrow at the command line, to access the; previous and next command. The commands are recorded in the history; file `$HOME/.root_hist`. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and; paste from it. You can specify the history file in the `system.rootrc`; file, by setting the `Rint.History `option. You can also turn off the; command logging in the `system.rootrc` file with the option:; `Rint.History: -`. The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in `.rootrc`; by:. ```; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; ```. The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached; all, the last `HistSave` lines will be removed. One can set `HistSize`; to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an; environment variable called `ROOT_HIST`. By setting; `ROOT_HIST=300:200` the above values can be overriden - the first; value corresponds to `HistSize`, the (optional) second one to; `HistSave`. You can set `ROOT_HIST=0` to disable the history. ### Tracking Memory Leaks. You can track memory usage and detect leaks by monitoring the number; of objects that are created and deleted (see **`TObjectTable`**).

They do so by extending the; substitution list, ``config.substitutions``. Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s. Alternatively, the above substitutions can be defined in a lit configuration; file to be shared with other test files. Either way, the test file can then; specify directives like the following to redefine the parameter substitutions as; desired before each use of ``%{check}`` in a ``RUN:`` line:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; REDEFINE: %{cflags} = -triple x86_64-apple-darwin10.6.0 -fopenmp-simd; ; REDEFINE: %{fcflags} = -check-prefix=SIMD; ; RUN: %{check}. ; REDEFINE: %{cflags} = -triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -fopenmp-simd; ; REDEFINE: %{fcflags} = -check-prefix=SIMD; ; RUN: %{check}. ; REDEFINE: %{cflags} = -triple x86_64-apple-darwin10.6.0",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:29324,test,test,29324,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"ffic. .. _dss_uniquevector:. llvm/ADT/UniqueVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. UniqueVector is similar to :ref:`SetVector <dss_setvector>` but it retains a; unique ID for each element inserted into the set. It internally contains a map; and a vector, and it assigns a unique ID for each value inserted into the set. UniqueVector is very expensive: its cost is the sum of the cost of maintaining; both the map and vector, it has high complexity, high constant factors, and; produces a lot of malloc traffic. It should be avoided. .. _dss_immutableset:. llvm/ADT/ImmutableSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ImmutableSet is an immutable (functional) set implementation based on an AVL; tree. Adding or removing elements is done through a Factory object and results; in the creation of a new ImmutableSet object. If an ImmutableSet already exists; with the given contents, then the existing one is returned; equality is compared; with a FoldingSetNodeID. The time and space complexity of add or remove; operations is logarithmic in the size of the original set. There is no method for returning an element of the set, you can only check for; membership. .. _dss_otherset:. Other Set-Like Container Options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The STL provides several other options, such as std::multiset and; std::unordered_set. We never use containers like unordered_set because; they are generally very expensive (each insertion requires a malloc). std::multiset is useful if you're not interested in elimination of duplicates,; but has all the drawbacks of :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`. A sorted vector; (where you don't delete duplicate entries) or some other approach is almost; always better. .. _ds_map:. Map-Like Containers (std::map, DenseMap, etc); ---------------------------------------------. Map-like containers are useful when you want to associate data to a key. As; usual, there are a lot of different ways to do this. :). .. _dss_sortedvectormap:. A sorted 'vector'; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work. However, it would; prevent a ``grep freebsd`` from finding this test. Better to use:; ``target={{.+-freebsd.*}} || target={{.+-netbsd.*}}``. Substitutions; -------------. Besides replacing LLVM tool names the following substitutions are performed in; RUN lines:. ``%%``; Replaced by a single ``%``. This allows escaping other substitutions. ``%s``; File path to the test case's source. This is suitable for passing on the; command line as the input to an LLVM tool. Example: ``/home/user/llvm/test/MC/ELF/foo_test.s``. ``%S``; Directory path to the test case's source. Example: ``/home/user/llvm/test/MC/ELF``. ``%t``; File path to a temporary file name that could be used for this test case.; The file name won't conflict with other test cases. You can append to it; if you need multiple temporaries. This is useful as the destination of; some redirected output. Example: ``/home/user/llvm.build/test/MC/ELF/Output/foo_test.s.tmp``. ``%T``; Directory of ``%t``. Deprecated. Shouldn't be used, because it can be easily; misused and cause race conditions between tests. Use ``rm -rf %t && mkdir %t`` instead if a temporary directory is necessary. Example: ``/home/user/llvm.build/test/MC/ELF/Output``. ``%{pathsep}``.

Testability,"fication-based vs. subset-based, etc. Traditionally,; alias analyses respond to a query with a `Must, May, or No`_ alias response,; indicating that two pointers always point to the same object, might point to the; same object, or are known to never point to the same object. The LLVM `AliasAnalysis; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__ class is the; primary interface used by clients and implementations of alias analyses in the; LLVM system. This class is the common interface between clients of alias; analysis information and the implementations providing it, and is designed to; support a wide range of implementations and clients (but currently all clients; are assumed to be flow-insensitive). In addition to simple alias analysis; information, this class exposes Mod/Ref information from those implementations; which can provide it, allowing for powerful analyses and transformations to work; well together. This document contains information necessary to successfully implement this; interface, use it, and to test both sides. It also explains some of the finer; points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview; ================================. The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__; class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations; should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and; ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref; query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in; several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a; starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual; ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to; get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions.

The ``Pass::getAnalysis<>`` method is automatically inherited by your class,; providing you with access to the passes that you declared that you required; with the :ref:`getAnalysisUsage <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysisUsage>`; method. It takes a single template argument that specifies which pass class; you want, and returns a reference to that pass. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. bool LICM::runOnFunction(Function &F) {; LoopInfo &LI = getAnalysis<LoopInfoWrapperPass>().getLoopInfo();; //...; }. This method call returns a reference to the pass desired. You may get a; runtime assertion failure if you attempt to get an analysis that you did not; declare as required in your :ref:`getAnalysisUsage; <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysisUsage>` implementation. This method can be; called by your ``run*`` method implementation, or by any other local method; invoked by your ``run*`` method. A module level pass can use function level analysis info using this interface.; For example:. .. code-block:: c++. bool ModuleLevelPass::runOnModule(Module &M) {; //...; DominatorTree &DT = getAnalysis<DominatorTree>(Func);; //...; }. In above example, ``runOnFunction`` for ``DominatorTree`` is called by pass; manager before returning a reference to the desired pass. If your pass is capable of updating analyses if they exist (e.g.,; ``BreakCriticalEdges``, as described above), you can use the; ``getAnalysisIfAvailable`` method, which returns a pointer to the analysis if; it is active.

For example,. .. code-block:: c. #include ""profile/instr_prof_interface.h"". // Then later in the same source file; if (__llvm_profile_dump() != 0) { ... }. The user code does not need to check if the API names are defined, because; these names are automatically replaced by ``(0)`` or the equivalence of noop; if the ``clang`` is not compiling for profile generation. Such replacement can happen because ``clang`` adds one of two macros depending; on the ``-fprofile-generate`` and the ``-fprofile-use`` flags. * ``__LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_GENERATE``: defined when one of; ``-fprofile[-instr]-generate``/``-fcs-profile-generate`` is in effect.; * ``__LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_USE``: defined when one of; ``-fprofile-use``/``-fprofile-instr-use`` is in effect. The two macros can be used to provide more flexibiilty so a user program; can execute code specifically intended for profile generate or profile use.; For example, a user program can have special logging during profile generate:. .. code-block:: c. #if __LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_GENERATE; expensive_logging_of_full_program_state();; #endif. The logging is automatically excluded during a normal build of the program,; hence it does not impact performance during a normal execution. It is advised to use such fine tuning only in a program's cold regions. The weak; symbols can introduce extra control flow (the ``if`` checks), while the macros; (hence declarations they guard in ``profile/instr_prof_interface.h``); can change the control flow of the functions that use them between profile; generation and profile use (which can lead to discarded counters in such; functions).

Testability,"following flags are; needed to pick up the includes and libraries:. * ``--gcc-toolchain=/path/to/dir/toolchain``; * ``--sysroot=/path/to/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc``. In this example we will be adding all of the command line options to both; ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS``. There are cmake flags to pass some of; these options individually which can be used to simplify the ``build-c-flags``:. * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/dir/toolchain``; * ``-DCMAKE_SYSROOT=/path/to/dir/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc``. Once cmake has completed the builtins can be built with ``ninja builtins``. Testing compiler-rt builtins using qemu-arm; ===========================================; To test the builtins library we need to add a few more cmake flags to enable; testing and set up the compiler and flags for test case. We must also tell; cmake that we wish to run the tests on ``qemu-arm``. * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_EMULATOR=""qemu-arm -L /path/to/armhf/sysroot``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER=""/path/to/clang""``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER_CFLAGS=""test-c-flags""``. The ``/path/to/armhf/sysroot`` should be the same as the one passed to; ``--sysroot`` in the ""build-c-flags"". The ""test-c-flags"" need to include the target, architecture, gcc-toolchain,; sysroot and arm/thumb state. The additional cmake defines such as; ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` do not apply when building the tests. If; you have put all of these in ""build-c-flags"" then these can be repeated. If you; wish to use lld to link the tests then add ``""-fuse-ld=lld``. Once cmake has completed the tests can be built and run using; ``ninja check-builtins``. Troubleshooting; ===============.

The primary interface for this class is to return a SamplingDistribution of a given TestStatistic.; The ToyMCSampler had a number of internal changes for improved performance with PROOF. These should be transparent. In addition, a new method was added RooAbsData* GenerateToyData(RooArgSet& paramPoint) that gives public access to the generation of toy data with all the same options for the treatment of nuisance parameters, binned or unbinned data, treatment of the global observables, importance sampling, etc. This is new method particularly useful for producing the expected limit bands where one needs to generate background-only pseudo-experiments in the same way that was used for the primary limit calculation. HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited.

As noted above, offsetting is purely a function of the `RooMinimizer` when using `TestStatistics` classes.; Whereas with `fitTo` we can pass in a `RooFit::Offset(true)` optional `RooCmdArg` argument to activate offsetting, here we must do it on the minimizer as follows:; ``` {.cpp}; m.setOffsetting(true);; ```. All existing functionality of the `RooMinimizer` can be used on `TestStatistics` likelihoods as well.; For instance, running a `migrad` fit:; ``` {.cpp}; m.migrad(); ```. ## Constant term optimization; The `RooAbsTestStatistic` based classes not only combine statistics and calculation, but also constant term optimization routines.; These can be run on PDFs and datasets before starting a fit.; They search the calculation graph for parts that are independent of the fit parameters, precalculates them, and adds them to (a clone of) the dataset so that these values can be used during calculation. In `RooFit::TestStatistics`, we separated this functionality out into the `ConstantTermsOptimizer` class.; In fact, it is not so much a class, as it is a collection of static functions that can be applied to any combination of pdf and dataset.; This class does essentially the same as `constOptimizeTestStatistic` did on a `RooNLLVar`, except that it has been factored out into a separate class. ### Usage example: apply constant term optimization on pdf and dataset inside a likelihood; Applying the default `ConstantTermsOptimizer` optimization routines on the pdf and dataset inside a `RooAbsL` likelihood is as simple as:. ``` {.cpp}; likelihood.constOptimizeTestStatistic();; ```; This applies constant term optimization to the cloned pdf and dataset inside the likelihood object.; It will not modify anything outside of the likelihood.

Testability,"formation is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely. The :doc:`LLVM test-suite <TestSuiteMakefileGuide>` provides a framework to; test the optimizer's handling of debugging information. It can be run like; this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=dbgopt.

LLVM Testing Infrastructure Organization; ========================================. The LLVM testing infrastructure contains three major categories of tests:; unit tests, regression tests and whole programs. The unit tests and regression; tests are contained inside the LLVM repository itself under ``llvm/unittests``; and ``llvm/test`` respectively and are expected to always pass -- they should be; run before every commit. The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory.

ToyMCSamplerUses a Toy Monte Carlo approach to build the; sampling distribution. �The pdf's generate method to generate is used to; generate toy data, and then the test statistic is evaluated at the; requested parameter point. ; DebuggingSampler Simply returns a uniform distribution; between 0,1. �Useful for debugging.

Otherwise git shows the file as untracked, unless you explicitly remove their tracking yourself with a .gitignore file. ## Building a tarball. Minuit2 standalone also has support for CPack to make installers for different platforms. To build a source package:. ```bash; make package_source; ```. This will create a source file in several formats that you can distribute. Reminder: You **must** have used `-Dminuit2_standalone=ON` when you configured CMake, or many of the files will be missing. ## Building a binary. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make; make package; ```. ## Maintenance. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to [ROOT], they should be added to the source files lists in `src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Minuit2/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). For testing, the main `test/CMakeLists.txt` is used by ROOT, and the `test/*/CMakeLists.txt` files are used by the standalone build. ## How it works. Extracting from the ROOT sources is made possible through a few careful design features:. * A CMake variable `minuit2_inroot` lets the build system know we are inside ROOT (it looks for `../../build/version_info`); * All files that are not part of the minuit2 directory are passed into `copy_standalone`, and that handles selecting the correct location; * `copy_standalone` copies the files into the minuit2 source directory if `minuit2_standalone` is `ON`. After this happens, all the standard CMake machinery can produce the source distribution. And, CMake correctly builds and installs in either mode, since all source and header files are explicitly listed.

You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:10439,Assert,Assertions,10439,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,1,['Assert'],['Assertions']

That is the case,; when we are interested in the effects caused by different versions of; the same toolchain, or the impact of specific compiler optimizations. For those cases, we are looking to see which elements have been added; or removed. Due to the complicated debug information format, it is very; difficult to use a regular diff tool to find those elements; even; impossible when dealing with different debug formats. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` supports a logical element comparison,; allowing to find semantic differences between logical views, produced by; different toolchain versions or even debug information formats. When comparing logical views created from different debug formats, its; accuracy depends on how close the debug information represents the; user code. For instance, a logical view created from a binary file with; DWARF debug information may include more detailed data than a logical; view created from a binary file with CodeView/COFF debug information. The following options describe the elements to compare. .. option:: --compare=<value[,value,...]>. With **value** being one of the options in the following list. .. code-block:: text. =all: Include all the below elements. .. code-block:: text. =lines: Include lines.; =scopes: Include scopes.; =symbols: Include symbols.; =types: Include types. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` takes the first binary file on the; command line as the **reference** and the second one as the **target**.; To get a more descriptive report, the comparison is done twice. The; reference and target views are swapped, in order to produce those; **missing** elements from the target view and those **added** elements; to the reference view.

The official LNT instance; of the LLVM project is hosted at [http://lnt.llvm.org](http://lnt.llvm.org). External Suites; ---------------. External suites such as SPEC can be enabled by either. - placing (or linking) them into the `test-suite/test-suite-externals/xxx` directory (example: `test-suite/test-suite-externals/speccpu2000`); - using a configuration option such as `-D TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT=path/to/speccpu2000`. You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run.

There are also CMake caches available to build; LLVM/Clang with BOLT. To configure a single-stage build that builds LLVM/Clang and then optimizes; it with BOLT, use the following CMake configuration:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake <path to source>/llvm -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/BOLT.cmake. Then, build the BOLT-optimized binary by running the following ninja command:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja clang-bolt.

This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location.

If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module. A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific; numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces; may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target; instructions are used to access the variable. The default address space; is zero. The address space qualifier must precede any other attributes. LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals to the section specified.; Additionally, the global can placed in a comdat if the target has the necessary; support. External declarations may have an explicit section specified. Section; information is retained in LLVM IR for targets that make use of this; information. Attaching section information to an external declaration is an; assertion that its definition is located in the specified section. If the; definition is located in a different section, the behavior is undefined. LLVM allows an explicit code model to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals in the code model specified,; overriding the code model used to compile the translation unit.; The allowed values are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model.

This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

In the rare situation where there are multiple authors, please use the `git; tag 'Co-authored-by:' to list the additional authors; <https://github.blog/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/>`_. * The title should be concise. Because all commits are emailed to the list with; the first line as the subject, long titles are frowned upon. Short titles; also look better in `git log`. * When the changes are restricted to a specific part of the code (e.g. a; back-end or optimization pass), it is customary to add a tag to the; beginning of the line in square brackets. For example, ""[SCEV] ...""; or ""[OpenMP] ..."". This helps email filters and searches for post-commit; reviews. * The body, if it exists, should be separated from the title by an empty line. * The body should be concise, but explanatory, including a complete; reasoning. Unless it is required to understand the change, examples,; code snippets and gory details should be left to bug comments, web; review or the mailing list. * Text formatting and spelling should follow the same rules as documentation; and in-code comments, ex. capitalization, full stop, etc. * If the commit is a bug fix on top of another recently committed patch, or a; revert or reapply of a patch, include the git commit hash of the prior; related commit.

Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program. If any; LLVM passes are specified on the command line, it runs these passes on the test; program. If any of the passes crash, or if they produce malformed output (which; causes the verifier to abort), ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_. Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output. Once ``bugpoint`` has a reference output for the; test program, it tries executing it with the selected code generator. If the; selected code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_ on; the code generator. Otherwise, if the resulting output differs from the; reference output, it assumes the difference resulted from a code generator; failure, and starts the `code generator debugger`_. Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it. If its output differs from the reference output, it assumes; the difference resulted from a failure in one of the LLVM passes, and enters the; `miscompilation debugger`_. Otherwise, there is no problem ``bugpoint`` can; debug. .. _crash debugger:. Crash debugger; --------------.

DESCRIPTION; -----------; :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` parses debug and text sections in; binary object files and prints their contents in a logical view, which; is a human readable representation that closely matches the structure; of the original user source code. Supported object file formats include; ELF, Mach-O, PDB and COFF. The **logical view** abstracts the complexity associated with the; different low-level representations of the debugging information that; is embedded in the object file. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer`; produces a canonical view of the debug information regardless of how it; is formatted. The same logical view will be seen regardless of object; file format, assuming the debug information correctly represents the; same original source code. The logical view includes the following **logical elements**: *type*,; *scope*, *symbol* and *line*, which are the basic software elements used; in the C/C++ programming language. Each logical element has a set of; **attributes**, such as *types*, *classes*, *functions*, *variables*,; *parameters*, etc. The :option:`--attribute` can be used to specify which; attributes to include when printing a logical element. A logical element; may have a **kind** that describes specific types of elements. For; instance, a *scope* could have a kind value of *function*, *class*,; *namespace*. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` defaults to print a pre-defined; layout of logical elements and attributes. The command line options can; be used to control the printed elements (:option:`--print`), using a; specific layout (:option:`--report`), matching a given pattern; (:option:`--select`, :option:`--select-offsets`). Also, the output can; be limited to specified logical elements using (:option:`--select-lines`,; :option:`--select-scopes`, :option:`--select-symbols`,; :option:`--select-types`).",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst:1117,log,logical,1117,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst,2,['log'],['logical']

After this pass the DBG_VALUE instruction changes meaning: rather than; corresponding to a source-level assignment where the variable may change value,; it asserts the location of a variable in a block, and loses effect outside the; block. Propagating variable locations through copies and spills is; straightforwards: determining the variable location in every basic block; requires the consideration of control flow. Consider the following IR, which; presents several difficulties:. .. code-block:: text. define dso_local i32 @foo(i1 %cond, i32 %input) !dbg !12 {; entry:; br i1 %cond, label %truebr, label %falsebr. bb1:; %value = phi i32 [ %value1, %truebr ], [ %value2, %falsebr ]; br label %exit, !dbg !26. truebr:; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %input, metadata !30, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !24; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 1, metadata !23, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !24; %value1 = add i32 %input, 1; br label %bb1. falsebr:; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %input, metadata !30, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !24; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 2, metadata !23",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:36957,assert,asserts,36957,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['assert'],['asserts']

Now that we have enough background knowledge, it's time to create the; simplest productive ClangTool in existence: a syntax checker. While this; already exists as ``clang-check``, it's important to understand what's; going on. First, we'll need to create a new directory for our tool and tell CMake; that it exists.

Testability,"gn; the driver expects that both of these; phases are platform neutral, with a few very well defined exceptions; such as whether the platform uses a driver driver. ToolChain Argument Translation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In order to match gcc very closely, the clang driver currently allows; tool chains to perform their own translation of the argument list (into; a new ArgList data structure). Although this allows the clang driver to; match gcc easily, it also makes the driver operation much harder to; understand (since the Tools stop seeing some arguments the user; provided, and see new ones instead). For example, on Darwin ``-gfull`` gets translated into two separate; arguments, ``-g`` and ``-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols``. Trying to; write Tool logic to do something with ``-gfull`` will not work, because; Tool argument translation is done after the arguments have been; translated. A long term goal is to remove this tool chain specific translation, and; instead force each tool to change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:13841,log,logic,13841,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

Forward-Edge CFI for Virtual Calls; ==================================. This scheme checks that virtual calls take place using a vptr of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the called object must be a; derived class of the static type of the object used to make the call.; This CFI scheme can be enabled on its own using ``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall``. For this scheme to work, all translation units containing the definition; of a virtual member function (whether inline or not), other than members; of :ref:`ignored <cfi-ignorelist>` types or types with public :doc:`LTO; visibility <LTOVisibility>`, must be compiled with ``-flto`` or ``-flto=thin``; enabled and be statically linked into the program. Performance; -----------. A performance overhead of less than 1% has been measured by running the; Dromaeo benchmark suite against an instrumented version of the Chromium; web browser. Another good performance benchmark for this mechanism is the; virtual-call-heavy SPEC 2006 xalancbmk. Note that this scheme has not yet been optimized for binary size; an increase; of up to 15% has been observed for Chromium. Bad Cast Checking; =================. This scheme checks that pointer casts are made to an object of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the object must be a derived class; of the pointee type of the cast. The checks are currently only introduced; where the class being casted to is a polymorphic class. Bad casts are not in themselves control flow integrity violations, but they; can also create security vulnerabilities, and the implementation uses many; of the same mechanisms. There are two types of bad cast that may be forbidden: bad casts; from a base class to a derived class (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-derived-cast``), and bad casts from a pointer",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:4877,benchmark,benchmark,4877,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

Testability,"h the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases. Clang also supports integrated generation of SPIR-V without use of ``llvm-spirv``; tool as an experimental feature when ``-fintegrated-objemitter`` flag is passed in; the command line. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -fintegrated-objemitter -c test.cl. Note that only very basic functionality is supported at this point and therefore; it is not suitable for arbitrary use cases. This feature is only enabled when clang; build is configured with ``-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=SPIRV`` option. Linking is done using ``spirv-link`` from `the SPIRV-Tools project; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#linker>`_. Similar to other external; linkers, Clang will expect ``spirv-link`` to be installed separately and to be; present in the ``PATH`` environment variable. Please refer to `the build and; installation instructions; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#build>`_. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv64 test1.cl test2.cl.

If a time axis has no specified; time offset, the global time offset will be stored in the axis data; structure. The histogram limits are in seconds. If `wmin` and `wmax` are; the histogram limits, the time axis will spread around the time offset; value from `TimeOffset+wmin` to `TimeOffset+wmax`. Until now all; examples had a lowest value equal to 0. The following example; demonstrates how to define the histogram limits relatively to the time; offset value. ![Time axis examples](pictures/030000C8.png). ``` {.cpp}; {; // Define the time offset as 2003, January 1st; TDatime T0(2003,01,01,00,00,00);; int X0 = T0.Convert();; gStyle->SetTimeOffset(X0);. // Define the lowest histogram limit as 2002,September 23rd; TDatime T1(2002,09,23,00,00,00);; int X1 = T1.Convert()-X0;. // Define the highest histogram limit as 2003, March 7th; TDatime T2(2003,03,07,00,00,00);; int X2 = T2.Convert(1)-X0;.

The output is shown in the next figure. Usually time axes are created; automatically via histograms, but one may also want to draw a time axis; outside a ""histogram context"". Therefore, it is useful to understand how; **`TGaxis`** works for such axis. The time offset can be defined using; one of the three methods described before. The time axis will spread; around the time offset value. Actually, it will go from; `TimeOffset+wmin` to `TimeOffset+wmax` where `wmin` and `wmax` are the; minimum and maximum values (in seconds) of the axis. Let us take again; an example.

There are cmake flags to pass some of; these options individually which can be used to simplify the ``build-c-flags``:. * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/dir/toolchain``; * ``-DCMAKE_SYSROOT=/path/to/dir/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc``. Once cmake has completed the builtins can be built with ``ninja builtins``. Testing compiler-rt builtins using qemu-arm; ===========================================; To test the builtins library we need to add a few more cmake flags to enable; testing and set up the compiler and flags for test case. We must also tell; cmake that we wish to run the tests on ``qemu-arm``. * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_EMULATOR=""qemu-arm -L /path/to/armhf/sysroot``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER=""/path/to/clang""``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER_CFLAGS=""test-c-flags""``. The ``/path/to/armhf/sysroot`` should be the same as the one passed to; ``--sysroot`` in the ""build-c-flags"". The ""test-c-flags"" need to include the target, architecture, gcc-toolchain,; sysroot and arm/thumb state. The additional cmake defines such as; ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` do not apply when building the tests. If; you have put all of these in ""build-c-flags"" then these can be repeated. If you; wish to use lld to link the tests then add ``""-fuse-ld=lld``. Once cmake has completed the tests can be built and run using; ``ninja check-builtins``. Troubleshooting; ===============. The cmake try compile stage fails; ---------------------------------; At an early stage cmake will attempt to compile and link a simple C program to; test if the toolchain is working.

Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend.

Testability,"hat can convey extra information about the code to the optimizers and; code generator. One example application of metadata is source-level; debug information. There are two metadata primitives: strings and nodes. Metadata does not have a type, and is not a value. If referenced from a; ``call`` instruction, it uses the ``metadata`` type. All metadata are identified in syntax by an exclamation point ('``!``'). .. _metadata-string:. Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings; -----------------------------------. A metadata string is a string surrounded by double quotes. It can; contain any character by escaping non-printable characters with; ""``\xx``"" where ""``xx``"" is the two digit hex code. For example:; ""``!""test\00""``"". Metadata nodes are represented with notation similar to structure; constants (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by braces and; preceded by an exclamation point). Metadata nodes can have any values as; their operand. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !{ !""test\00"", i32 10}. Metadata nodes that aren't uniqued use the ``distinct`` keyword. For example:. .. code-block:: text. !0 = distinct !{!""test\00"", i32 10}. ``distinct`` nodes are useful when nodes shouldn't be merged based on their; content. They can also occur when transformations cause uniquing collisions; when metadata operands change. A :ref:`named metadata <namedmetadatastructure>` is a collection of; metadata nodes, which can be looked up in the module symbol table. For; example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !foo = !{!4, !3}. Metadata can be used as function arguments.

Testability,"hat rules can be added to. If multiple opcodes are given, they are; all permanently bound to the same ruleset. The rules in a ruleset are executed; from top to bottom and will start again from the top if an instruction is; legalized as a result of the rules. If the ruleset is exhausted without; satisfying any rule, then it is considered unsupported. When it doesn't declare the instruction legal, each pass over the rules may; request that one type changes to another type. Sometimes this can cause multiple; types to change but we avoid this as much as possible as making multiple changes; can make it difficult to avoid infinite loops where, for example, narrowing one; type causes another to be too small and widening that type causes the first one; to be too big. In general, it's advisable to declare instructions legal as close to the top of; the rule as possible and to place any expensive rules as low as possible. This; helps with performance as testing for legality happens more often than; legalization and legalization can require multiple passes over the rules. As a concrete example, consider the rule::. getActionDefinitionsBuilder({G_ADD, G_SUB, G_MUL, G_AND, G_OR, G_XOR, G_SHL}); .legalFor({s32, s64, v2s32, v4s32, v2s64}); .clampScalar(0, s32, s64); .widenScalarToNextPow2(0);. and the instruction::. %2:_(s7) = G_ADD %0:_(s7), %1:_(s7). this doesn't meet the predicate for the :ref:`.legalFor() <legalfor>` as ``s7``; is not one of the listed types so it falls through to the; :ref:`.clampScalar() <clampscalar>`. It does meet the predicate for this rule; as the type is smaller than the ``s32`` and this rule instructs the legalizer; to change type 0 to ``s32``. It then restarts from the top. This time it does; satisfy ``.legalFor()`` and the resulting output is::. %3:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %0:_(s7); %4:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %1:_(s7); %5:_(s32) = G_ADD %3:_(s32), %4:_(s32); %2:_(s7) = G_TRUNC %5:_(s32). where the ``G_ADD`` is legal and the other instructions are scheduled for; pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst:4879,test,testing,4879,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Some tips for getting your testcase approved:. * All feature and regression test cases are added to the ``llvm/test``; directory. The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the; :doc:`Testing Guide <TestingGuide>` for details). * Test cases should be written in :doc:`LLVM assembly language <LangRef>`. * Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,; by :doc:`bugpoint <Bugpoint>` or manually. It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links. Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature; tests only.

Testability,"have been identified; through years of use: confusing to use, slow, it doesn’t always produce high; quality test cases, etc. This document proposes a new approach with a narrower; focus: minimization of IR test cases. ## Proposed New Design. ### Narrow focus: test-case reduction; The main focus will be a code reduction strategy to obtain much smaller test; cases that still have the same property as the original one. This will be done; via classic delta debugging and by adding some IR-specific reductions (e.g.; replacing globals, removing unused instructions, etc), similar to what; already exists, but with more in-depth minimization. Granted, if the community differs on this proposal, the legacy code could still; be present in the tool, but with the caveat of still being documented and; designed towards delta reduction. ### Command-Line Options; We are proposing to reduce the plethora of bugpoint’s options to just two: an; interesting-ness test and the arguments for said test, similar to other delta; reduction tools such as CReduce, Delta, and Lithium; the tool should feel less; cluttered, and there should also be no uncertainty about how to operate it. The interesting-ness test that’s going to be run to reduce the code is given; by name:; `--test=<test_name>`; If a `--test` option is not given, the program exits; this option is similar; to bugpoint’s current `-compile-custom` option, which lets the user run a; custom script. The interesting-ness test would be defined as a script that returns 0 when the; IR achieves a user-defined behaviour (e.g. failure to compile on clang) and a; nonzero value when otherwise. Leaving the user the freedom to determine what is; and isn’t interesting to the tool, and thus, streamlining the process of; reducing a test-case.

Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan-build in order to analyze the project.; Example. $ scan-build ./configure; $ scan-build --keep-cc make.

It holds the direction of stack growth, the known; stack alignment on entry to each function, and the offset to the local area.; The offset to the local area is the offset from the stack pointer on function; entry to the first location where function data (local variables, spill; locations) can be stored. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class; -----------------------------. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class is used to provide information about the specific; chip set being targeted. A sub-target informs code generation of which; instructions are supported, instruction latencies and instruction execution; itinerary; i.e., which processing units are used, in what order, and for how; long. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class exposes an abstract interface used by the; Just-In-Time code generator to perform target-specific activities, such as; emitting stubs.

Testability,"he load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; ```.

It's an error to use; ``std::complex`` in ``__device__`` code, but it often works in ``__host__; __device__`` code due to nvcc's interpretation of the ""wrong-side rule"" (see; below). However, we have heard from implementers that it's possible to get; into situations where nvcc will omit a call to an ``std::complex`` function,; especially when compiling without optimizations.

Although clang's CUDA implementation is largely compatible with NVCC's, you may; still want to detect when you're compiling CUDA code specifically with clang. This is tricky, because NVCC may invoke clang as part of its own compilation; process! For example, NVCC uses the host compiler's preprocessor when; compiling for device code, and that host compiler may in fact be clang.

Testability,"he; demangled AST. Why are there multiple copies of the this library in the source tree?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. The canonical sources are in libcxxabi/src/demangle and some of the; files are copied to llvm/include/llvm/Demangle. The simple reason for; this comes from before the monorepo, and both [sub]projects need to; demangle symbols, but neither can depend on each other. * libcxxabi needs the demangler to implement __cxa_demangle, which is; part of the itanium ABI spec. * LLVM needs a copy for a bunch of places, and cannot rely on the; system's __cxa_demangle because it a) might not be available (i.e.,; on Windows), and b) may not be up-to-date on the latest language; features. The copy of the demangler in LLVM has some extra stuff that aren't; needed in libcxxabi (ie, the MSVC demangler, ItaniumPartialDemangler),; which depend on the shared generic components. Despite these; differences, we want to keep the ""core"" generic demangling library; identical between both copies to simplify development and testing. If you're working on the generic library, then do the work first in; libcxxabi, then run libcxxabi/src/demangle/cp-to-llvm.sh. This; script takes as an optional argument the path to llvm, and copies the; changes you made to libcxxabi over. Note that this script just; blindly overwrites all changes to the generic library in llvm, so be; careful. Because the core demangler needs to work in libcxxabi, everything; needs to be declared in an anonymous namespace (see; DEMANGLE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN), and you can't introduce any code that; depends on the libcxx dylib. FIXME: Now that LLVM is a monorepo, it should be possible to; de-duplicate this code, and have both LLVM and libcxxabi depend on a; shared demangler library. Testing; -------.

The ``llvm/Support/Debug.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Debug_8h_source.html>`__) file provides a macro named; ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` that is a much nicer solution to this problem. Basically, you can; put arbitrary code into the argument of the ``LLVM_DEBUG`` macro, and it is only; executed if '``opt``' (or any other tool) is run with the '``-debug``' command; line argument:. .. code-block:: c++. LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() << ""I am here!\n"");. Then you can run your pass like this:. .. code-block:: none. $ opt < a.bc > /dev/null -mypass; <no output>; $ opt < a.bc > /dev/null -mypass -debug; I am here!. Using the ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macro instead of a home-brewed solution allows you to not; have to create ""yet another"" command line option for the debug output for your; pass. Note that ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macros are disabled for non-asserts builds, so they; do not cause a performance impact at all (for the same reason, they should also; not contain side-effects!). One additional nice thing about the ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macro is that you can enable or; disable it directly in gdb. Just use ""``set DebugFlag=0``"" or ""``set; DebugFlag=1``"" from the gdb if the program is running. If the program hasn't; been started yet, you can always just run it with ``-debug``. .. _DEBUG_TYPE:.

ABI tags are declared in an abi_tag attribute and can be applied to a; function, variable, class or inline namespace declaration. The attribute takes; one or more strings (called tags); the order does not matter. See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Attributes.html for; details. Tags on an inline namespace are called ""implicit tags"", all other tags are; ""explicit tags"". Mangling; ========. All tags that are ""active"" on an <unqualified-name> are emitted after the; <unqualified-name>, before <template-args> or <discriminator>, and are part of; the same <substitution> the <unqualified-name> is.

Example:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((abi_tag(""test""))); void Func();; // gets mangled as: _Z4FuncB4testv (prettified as `Func[abi:test]()`). Active tags; ===========. A namespace does not have any active tags. For types (class / struct / union /; enum), the explicit tags are the active tags. For variables and functions, the active tags are the explicit tags plus any; ""required tags"" which are not in the ""available tags"" set:. .. code-block:: none. derived-tags := (required-tags - available-tags); active-tags := explicit-tags + derived-tags.

First, we load the shared library and open `Event.root`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L libEvent.so; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] f->ls();; TFile** Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; TFile* Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; KEY: TH1F htime;1 Real-Time to write versus time; KEY: TTree T;1 An example of a ROOT tree; ```. We can see there is a tree ""`T`"", and just to verify that we are working; with the correct one, we print the tree, which will show us the header; and branches. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Print();; ```. From the output of print we can see that the tree has one branch for; each data member of `Event`, `Track`, and `EventHeader`. Now we can use; `TTree::MakeClass` on our tree ""`T`"". `MakeClass` takes one parameter, a; string containing the name of the class to be made. In the command; below, the name of our class will be ""`MyClass`"". ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->MakeClass(""MyClass""); Files: MyClass.h and MyClass.C generated from Tree: T; ```. Cling informs us that it has created two files. `MyClass.`h contains the; class definition and `MyClass.C` contains the `MyClass::Loop()` method.; `MyClass` has more methods than just `Loop()`.

The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly.

CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large.

Testability,"his needs to be extracted; into the `MathFuncs.h` file and the fully qualified name of the function; referencing that file should be used here instead. ## After Code Generation Support. Following is a code snippet from `RooPoisson` *after* it has AD support. ### Step 1. Refactor the `RooPoisson::evaluate()` Function. ``` {.cpp}; /// Implementation in terms of the TMath::Poisson() function. double RooPoisson::evaluate() const; {; double k = _noRounding ? x : floor(x);; if(_protectNegative && mean<0) {; RooNaNPacker np;; np.setPayload(-mean);; return np._payload;; }; return RooFit::Detail::MathFuncs::poisson(k, mean);; }; ```. Note that the `evaluate()` function was refactored in such a way that the; mathematical parts were moved to an inline function in a separate header file; named `MathFuncs`, so that Clad could see and differentiate that function.; The rest of the contents of the function remain unchanged. > All contents of the `evaluate()` function don't always need to be pulled; out, only the required parts (mathematical logic) should be moved to; `MathFuncs`. **What is MathFuncs?**. Moving away from the class-based hierarchy design, `MathFuncs.h` a simply; a flat file of function implementations. This file is required since Clad will not be able to see anything that is not; inlined and explicitly available to it during compilation (since it has to be; in the same translation). So other than of generating these functions on the; fly, your only other option is to place these functions in a separate header; file and make them inline. Theoretically, multiple header files can also be used and then mashed; together. > Directory path: [roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/MathFuncs.h](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/MathFuncs.h). ### Step 2.

Testability,"his script loops on all; events. For each event, the branch containing the number of tracks is; read. In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`. The; performance depends not only of the processor type, but also of the disk; devices (local, NFS, AFS, etc.). ## Chains; \index{tree!chains}. A **`TChain`** object is a list of ROOT files containing the same tree.; As an example, assume we have three files called; `file1.root, file2.root, file3.root`.

We can create a chain with the following statements:. ``` {.cpp}; TChain chain(""T""); // name of the tree is the argument; chain.Add(""file1.root"");; chain.Add(""file2.root"");; chain.Add(""file3.root"");; ```. The name of the **`TChain`** will be the same as the name of the tree;; in this case it will be `""T"".

In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker.

Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow.

It's usually easy to tell: just look for; redirection or piping of the ``FileCheck`` call's stdout or stderr. .. _Test-specific substitutions:. **Test-specific substitutions:**. Additional substitutions can be defined as follows:. - Lit configuration files (e.g., ``lit.cfg`` or ``lit.local.cfg``) can define; substitutions for all tests in a test directory. They do so by extending the; substitution list, ``config.substitutions``. Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s. Alternatively, the above substitutions can be defined in a lit configuration; file to be shared with other test files. Either way, the test file can then; specify directives like the following to redefine the parameter substitutions as; desired before each use of ``%{check}`` in a ``RUN:`` line:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; REDEFINE: %{cflags} = -triple x86_64-apple-darwin10.6.0 -fopenmp-simd; ; REDEFINE: %{fcflags} = -check-prefix=SIMD; ; RUN: %{che",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:29149,test,test,29149,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Let's look at an example plugin that prints top-level function names. This; example is checked into the clang repository; please take a look at; the `latest version of PrintFunctionNames.cpp; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/examples/PrintFunctionNames/PrintFunctionNames.cpp>`_. Running the plugin; ==================. Using the compiler driver; --------------------------. The Clang driver accepts the `-fplugin` option to load a plugin.; Clang plugins can receive arguments from the compiler driver command; line via the `fplugin-arg-<plugin name>-<argument>` option. Using this; method, the plugin name cannot contain dashes itself, but the argument; passed to the plugin can. .. code-block:: console. $ export BD=/path/to/build/directory; $ make -C $BD CallSuperAttr; $ clang++ -fplugin=$BD/lib/CallSuperAttr.so \; -fplugin-arg-call_super_plugin-help \; test.cpp. If your plugin name contains dashes, either rename the plugin or used the; cc1 command line options listed below. Using the cc1 command line; --------------------------. To run a plugin, the dynamic library containing the plugin registry must be; loaded via the `-load` command line option. This will load all plugins; that are registered, and you can select the plugins to run by specifying the; `-plugin` option. Additional parameters for the plugins can be passed with; `-plugin-arg-<plugin-name>`. Note that those options must reach clang's cc1 process. There are two; ways to do so:. * Directly call the parsing process by using the `-cc1` option; this; has the downside of not configuring the default header search paths, so; you'll need to specify the full system path configuration on the command; line.; * Use clang as usual, but prefix all arguments to the cc1 process with; `-Xclang`.

Testability,"hub. A pull request (PR) should contain a set focused changes; organized in one or more [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Revision_control).; PRs should be well-documented and well-tested in order to allow other community; members to use, maintain and modify. If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; However, we disallow error messages in gtests, or sometimes we want to test the; error conditions of an interface and its diagnostics.

In this case one pass the object pointer and a pointer to the member function `(&Foo::Eval)`. The function dimension is required when constructing the functor.

The most distinct aspect of SSA values; is that their value is computed as the related instruction executes, and; it does not get a new value until (and if) the instruction re-executes.; In other words, there is no way to ""change"" an SSA value. For more; information, please read up on `Static Single; Assignment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_; - the concepts are really quite natural once you grok them. Note that instead of adding virtual methods to the ExprAST class; hierarchy, it could also make sense to use a `visitor; pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern>`_ or some other; way to model this. Again, this tutorial won't dwell on good software; engineering practices: for our purposes, adding a virtual method is; simplest.

Example:; `successors: %bb.1(0x40000000), %bb.2(0x40000000)` can be replaced with; `successors: %bb.1, %bb.2`. - MIR code contains a whole IR module. This is necessary because there are; no equivalents in MIR for global variables, references to external functions,; function attributes, metadata, debug info. Instead some MIR data references; the IR constructs. You can often remove them if the test doesn't depend on; them. - Alias Analysis is performed on IR values. These are referenced by memory; operands in MIR. Example: `:: (load 8 from %ir.foobar, !alias.scope !9)`.; If the test doesn't depend on (good) alias analysis the references can be; dropped: `:: (load 8)`. - MIR blocks can reference IR blocks for debug printing, profile information; or debug locations.

Testability,"ich reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached.

Is optimized to:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define void @bar() {; unreachable; }. ... with ""``opt -instcombine -simplifycfg``"". This often bites people because; ""all their code disappears"". Setting the calling convention on the caller and; callee is required for indirect calls to work, so people often ask why not; make the verifier reject this sort of thing. The answer is that this code has undefined behavior, but it is not illegal.; If we made it illegal, then every transformation that could potentially create; this would have to ensure that it doesn't, and there is valid code that can; create this sort of construct (in dead code). The sorts of things that can; cause this to happen are fairly contrived, but we still need to accept them.; Here's an example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define internal void @bar(void()* %FP, i1 %cond) {; br i1 %cond, label %T, label %F; T:; call void %FP(); ret void; F:; call fastcc void %FP(); ret void; }; define void @test() {; %X = or i1 false, false; call void @bar(void()* @foo, i1 %X); ret void; }. In this example, ""test"" always passes ``@foo``/``false`` into ``bar``, which; ensures that it is dynamically called with the right calling conv (thus, the; code is perfectly well defined).

Here you can see that the inlining pass made an undefined call to ``@foo``; with the wrong calling convention.

From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md:14962,Log,Log,14962,README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,1,['Log'],['Log']
Testability,"ided by your telephone; service. You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in; this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone. If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save; you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components of; ROOT: Command Line Interpreter, Histograms and Fitting, Writing a; Graphical User Interface, 2D Graphics, Input/Output , Collection; Classes, Script Processor. There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics,; Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI),; Socket and Network Communication, Threads. #### Advantages of Frameworks. The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. - Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and; reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such; as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and; customize. - More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a; framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of; the framework. - More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides; consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter; who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into; smaller pieces. - More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their; particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at; writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the; frameworks that provide those services. ### Why Object-Oriented?. Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to; Procedure-Oriented Programming:. - Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity; for reuse. - Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify; objects. - Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide; a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the; relationships among them. - Complexity is reduced because there is ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:7476,test,tested,7476,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['test'],['tested']

For more details, see the reference documentation of **`TMath`** at; [<http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TMath.html>](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceTMath.html). ### Numerical Constants. `TMath` offers a wide range of constants in the form of inline functions. Notice that they are not defined as C/C++ preprocessor macros. This set of functions includes one or more definitions for the following constants:. * Pi.; * Base of natural logarithm.; * Velocity of light.; * Gravitational constant (G).; * Standard acceleration of gravity (g).; * Standard acceleration of Gravity.; * Plank's contant.; * Boltzmann's and Steffan-Boltzmann's constants.; * Avogadro's number.; * Universal gas constant.; * Molecular weight of dry air.; * Dry air gas constant.; * Euler-Mascheroni Constant.; * Elementary charge. ### Elementary Functions. A set of miscellaneous elementary mathematical functions is provided along with a set of basic trigonometrical functions. Some of this functions refer to basic mathematical functions like the square root, the power to a number of the calculus of a logarithm, while others are used for number treatment, like rounding. Although there are some functions that are not in the standard C math library (like `Factorial`), most of the functionality offered here is just a wrapper of the first ones. Nevertheless, some of the them also offer some security checks or a better precision, like the trigonometri",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:6871,log,logarithm,6871,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['log'],['logarithm']
Testability,"ident = !{!0}; !0 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V3""}. For symmetry reasons, ``ident.ll`` is just a dummy file that doesn't; actually participate in the test besides holding the ``RUN:`` lines. .. note::. Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file. For example, :program:`opt` by; default outputs a ``ModuleID``:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat example.ll; define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. $ opt -S /path/to/example.ll; ; ModuleID = '/path/to/example.ll'. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. ``ModuleID`` can unexpectedly match against ``CHECK`` lines. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory. To make your tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:17024,test,test,17024,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test']

This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure.

Testability,"if any of these files exist. The index page will also; contain a list of links to all files in the directory that end on; `.html` or `.txt`. Files ending on `.txt` will be converted to HTML; before they are copied to the output directory. For each file, the; link's text will be the file name without extension, with underscores; replaced by spaces. You can see an example of the module documentation including links, the; corresponding `index.html`, and the module class index at; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/HIST_Index.html>. ## Converting Sources (and Other Files) to HTML. **`THtml`** can take a file (C++ or text) and convert it to HTML. There; are two main use cases:. The output of a **macro** converted to HTML will almost look like the; beautified source file of a class reference. The `Begin_Html/End_Html`; keywords are supported; comments, strings, and keywords are colored like; in **`THtml`**'s output for source code. The macro `Event.cxx` in `$ROOTSYS/test` can be seen as an example of; documented ROOT macros at; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/Event.cxx.html>. `THtml::Convert()`converts a single text file to HTML. For example, it; can be run on a change log. Each known class name will be linked to its; documentation page. An example is ROOT's change log at; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/V5.16.txt.html>. To convert the source file MyCode.C to HTML, you can run. ``` {.cpp}; root[] THtml h; root[] h.Convert(""MyCode.C"", ""Look At My Code"", ""htmlout/"");; ```. This will create the file `htmlout/MyCode.C.html`. The HTML page will; have the title ""Look At My Code"". ## Special Documentation Elements: Directives. A common documentation problem is the inclusion of images. They are; usually generated externally, which poses problems with where to keep; the images, and how to keep them up to date. **`THtml`** solves this by; offering a few special documentation elements: macro and latex; directives. ### Latex Directive.

The test succeeded after being re-run more than once. This only applies to; tests containing an ``ALLOW_RETRIES:`` annotation. **XFAIL**. The test failed, but that is expected. This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure.

It should be assumed that; there are either 0 hash values, or a number equal to the number of type; records in the TPI stream (``TypeIndexEnd - TypeEndBegin``). Thus, if; ``HashBufferLength`` is not equal to ``(TypeIndexEnd - TypeEndBegin) *; HashKeySize`` we can consider the PDB malformed. - **IndexOffsetBufferOffset / IndexOffsetBufferLength** - The offset and size; within the TPI Hash Stream of the Type Index Offsets Buffer. This is a list; of pairs of uint32_t's where the first value is a :ref:`Type Index; <type_indices>` and the second value is the offset in the type record data of; the type with this index.

RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2.

Another use of ``__has_feature`` is to check for compiler features not related; to the language standard, such as e.g. :doc:`AddressSanitizer; <AddressSanitizer>`. If the ``-pedantic-errors`` option is given, ``__has_extension`` is equivalent; to ``__has_feature``. The feature tag is described along with the language feature below. The feature name or extension name can also be specified with a preceding and; following ``__`` (double underscore) to avoid interference from a macro with; the same name. For instance, ``__cxx_rvalue_references__`` can be used instead; of ``cxx_rvalue_references``. ``__has_cpp_attribute``; -----------------------.

Testability,"iles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:. Miscompilation debugger; -----------------------. The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger. It; works by splitting the test program into two pieces, running the optimizations; specified on one piece, linking the two pieces back together, and then executing; the result. It attempts to narrow down the list of passes to the one (or few); which are causing the miscompilation, then reduce the portion of the test; program which is being miscompiled. The miscompilation debugger assumes that; the selected code generator is working properly. Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead.

However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed. For example:. > [roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx). > Tip: Tests like above can be referenced to see which parts of RooFit already; support AD. ### How do I control my compile time?. This is an area of research that still needs some work. In most cases, the; compile times are reasonable, but with an increase in the level of complexity,; higher compile times may be encountered. ## Appendix B - Where does AD Logic Implementation reside?. Following classes provide several Helper Functions to translate existing logic; into AD-supported logic. a - RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext. b - RooFuncWrapper. ### a.

It handles how to create a C++ function out of the compute graph (which is; created with different RooFit classes). This C++ function will be independent; of these RooFit classes. RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext helps traverse the compute graph received from RooFit and; then it translates that into a single piece of code (a C++ function), that can; then be differentiated using Clad. It also helps evaluate the model. In RooFit, evaluation is done using the 'evaluate()' function. It also; performs a lot of book-keeping, caching, etc. that is required for RooFit (but; not necessarily for AD",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:29647,Log,Logic,29647,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['Log'],['Logic']

The ``assert`` statement checks a boolean condition to be sure that it is true; and prints an error message if it is not. .. productionlist::; Assert: ""assert"" `condition` "","" `message` "";"". If the boolean condition is true, the statement does nothing. If the; condition is false, it prints a nonfatal error message. The **message**, which; can be an arbitrary string expression, is included in the error message as a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class. The assertions are; then checked when the records are completely built. * In a multiclass definition, the assertions are saved with the other; components of the multiclass and then checked each time the multiclass; is instantiated with ``defm``. Using assertions in TableGen files can simplify record checking in TableGen; backends. Here is an example of an ``assert`` in two class definitions. .. code-block:: text. class PersonName<string name> {; assert !le(!size(name), 32), ""person name is too long: "" # name;; string Name = name;; }. class Person<string name, int age> : PersonName<name> {; assert !and(!ge(age, 1), !le(age, 120)), ""person age is invalid: "" # age;; int Age = age;; }. def Rec20 : Person<""Donald Knuth"", 60> {; ...; }.

Testability,"iming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses). This is done in the deallocation path,; and several options exist to tune this behavior. Usage; =====. Platform; --------; If using Fuchsia or an Android version greater than 11, your memory allocations; are already service by Scudo (note that Android Svelte configurations still use; jemalloc). Library; -------; The allocator static library can be built from the LLVM tree thanks to the; ``scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. The associated tests can be exercised thanks to; the ``check-scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. Linking the static library to your project can require the use of the; ``whole-archive`` linker flag (or equivalent), depending on your linker.; Additional flags might also be necessary. Your linked binary should now make use of the Scudo allocation and deallocation; functions. You may also build Scudo like this:. .. code:: console. cd $LLVM/compiler-rt/lib; clang++ -fPIC -std=c++17 -msse4.2 -O2 -pthread -shared \; -I scudo/standalone/include \; scudo/standalone/*.cpp \; -o $HOME/libscudo.so. and then use it with existing binaries as follows:. .. code:: console. LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/libscudo.so ./a.out. Clang; -----; With a recent version of Clang (post rL317337), the ""old"" version of the; allocator can be linked with a binary at compilation using the; ``-fsanitize=scudo`` command-line argument, if the target platform is supported.; Currently, the only other sanitizer Scudo is compatible with is UBSan; (eg: ``-fsanitize=scudo,undefined``).

Testability,"important when it comes to deleting objects; if; nobody owns the object it could end up as wasted memory (i.e. a memory; leak) when no longer needed. If a collection is deleted, its objects are; not. The user can force a collection to delete its objects, but that is; the user's choice. ### Determining the Class of Contained Objects. Most containers may hold heterogeneous collections of objects and then; it is left to the user to correctly cast the **`TObject`** pointer to; the right class. Casting to the wrong class will give wrong results and; may well crash the program! Therefore, the user has to be very careful.; Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really; contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class; using the `InheritsFrom` method. For example if `myObject` is a **`TObject`** pointer:. ``` {.cpp}; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; ```. As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass; of **`TParticle`**. The member function `IsA()` can be used instead of; `InheritsFrom` to make the test exact. The `InheritsFrom` and `IsA`; methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via; the ROOT meta-classes. ### Types of Collections. The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections:; unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next; figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection; classes. All primary collection classes derive from the abstract base; class **`TCollection`**. ![The inheritance hierarchy of the primary collection classes](pictures/020001A3.jpg). ### Ordered Collections (Sequences). Sequences are collections that are externally ordered because they; maintain internal elements according to the order in which they were; added. The following sequences are available:. - **`TList`**. - **`THashList`**. - **`TOrdCollection`**. - **`TObjArray`**. - **`TClonesArray",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:3286,test,test,3286,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['test'],['test']

At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly.

CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large. It's a better choice than SparseBitVector when find(); operations must have fast, predictable performance. However, it's not a good; choice for representing sets which have lots of very short ranges.

In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?.

Clang currently supports OpenCL C language standards up to v2.0. Clang mainly; supports full profile. There is only very limited support of the embedded; profile.; From clang 9 a C++ mode is available for OpenCL (see; :ref:`C++ for OpenCL <cxx_for_opencl>`). OpenCL v3.0 support is complete but it remains in experimental state, see more; details about the experimental features and limitations in :doc:`OpenCLSupport`; page. OpenCL Specific Options; -----------------------. Most of the OpenCL build options from `the specification v2.0 section 5.8.4; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-2.0.pdf#200>`_ are available. Examples:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -cl-std=CL2.0 -cl-single-precision-constant test.cl. Many flags used for the compilation for C sources can also be passed while; compiling for OpenCL, examples: ``-c``, ``-O<1-4|s>``, ``-o``, ``-emit-llvm``, etc. Some extra options are available to support special OpenCL features. .. option:: -cl-no-stdinc. Allows to disable all extra types and functions that are not native to the compiler.; This might reduce the compilation speed marginally but many declarations from the; OpenCL standard will not be accessible. For example, the following will fail to; compile. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""bool is_wg_uniform(int i){return get_enqueued_local_size(i)==get_local_size(i);}"" > test.cl; $ clang -cl-std=CL2.0 -cl-no-stdinc test.cl; error: use of undeclared identifier 'get_enqueued_local_size'; error: use of undeclared identifier 'get_local_size'.

Testability,"in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------. The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details.

Testability,"in the C11; standard. In C, type compatibility is decided according to the rules given in the; appropriate standard, but in C++, which lacks the type compatibility rules used; in C, types are considered compatible only if they are equivalent. Clang also supports an extended form of ``_Generic`` with a controlling type; rather than a controlling expression. Unlike with a controlling expression, a; controlling type argument does not undergo any conversions and thus is suitable; for use when trying to match qualified types, incomplete types, or function; types. Variable-length array types lack the necessary compile-time information; to resolve which association they match with and thus are not allowed as a; controlling type argument. Use ``__has_extension(c_generic_selection_with_controlling_type)`` to determine; if support for this extension is enabled. C11 ``_Static_assert()``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(c_static_assert)`` or ``__has_extension(c_static_assert)``; to determine if support for compile-time assertions using ``_Static_assert`` is; enabled. C11 ``_Thread_local``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(c_thread_local)`` or ``__has_extension(c_thread_local)``; to determine if support for ``_Thread_local`` variables is enabled. Modules; -------. Use ``__has_feature(modules)`` to determine if Modules have been enabled.; For example, compiling code with ``-fmodules`` enables the use of Modules.

Testability,"in your tool code where possible as it can greatly improve; readability. .. _err_cantfail:. Using cantFail to simplify safe callsites; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some functions may only fail for a subset of their inputs, so calls using known; safe inputs can be assumed to succeed. The cantFail functions encapsulate this by wrapping an assertion that their; argument is a success value and, in the case of Expected<T>, unwrapping the; T value:. .. code-block:: c++. Error onlyFailsForSomeXValues(int X);; Expected<int> onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(int X);. void foo() {; cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues(KnownSafeValue));; int Y = cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(KnownSafeValue));; ...; }. Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments. Use of the cantFail functions should be rare in library code, but they are; likely to be of more use in tool and unit-test code where inputs and/or; mocked-up classes or functions may be known to be safe.

Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test.

There are several limitations to when ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` options can be; specified. For example, only one ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` can be specified per; program, there must be at least one `positional argument`_ specified, there must; not be any `cl::list`_ positional arguments, and the ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` option; should be a `cl::list`_ option. .. _can be changed:; .. _Internal vs External Storage:.

By default (``-detect_leaks=1``) libFuzzer will count the number of; ``malloc`` and ``free`` calls when executing every mutation.; If the numbers don't match (which by itself doesn't mean there is a leak); libFuzzer will invoke the more expensive LeakSanitizer_; pass and if the actual leak is found, it will be reported with the reproducer; and the process will exit. If your target has massive leaks and the leak detection is disabled; you will eventually run out of RAM (see the ``-rss_limit_mb`` flag). Developing libFuzzer; ====================. LibFuzzer is built as a part of LLVM project by default on macos and Linux.; Users of other operating systems can explicitly request compilation using; ``-DCOMPILER_RT_BUILD_LIBFUZZER=ON`` flag.; Tests are run using ``check-fuzzer`` target from the build directory; which was configured with ``-DCOMPILER_RT_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON`` flag. .. code-block:: console. ninja check-fuzzer. FAQ; =========================. Q. Why doesn't libFuzzer use any of the LLVM support?; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two reasons. First, we want this library to be used outside of the LLVM without users having to; build the rest of LLVM. This may sound unconvincing for many LLVM folks,; but in practice the need for building the whole LLVM frightens many potential; users -- and we want more users to use this code. Second, there is a subtle technical reason not to rely on the rest of LLVM, or; any other large body of code (maybe not even STL). When coverage instrumentation; is enabled, it will also instrument the LLVM support code which will blow up the; coverage set of the process (since the fuzzer is in-process). In other words, by; using more external dependencies we will slow down the fuzzer while the main; reason for it to exist is ext",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:27423,Test,Tests,27423,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,1,['Test'],['Tests']

In upcoming releases, further developments are planned:. - Benchmark/profile and optimize performance further; - Add a `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` interface around these new classes; - Achieve feature parity with existing `RooNLLVar` functionality, e.g. ranges are not yet supported. For more details, consult the usage notes in the [TestStatistics README.md](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/TestStatistics/README.md).; For benchmarking results on the prototype version of the parallelized gradient calculator, see the corresponding [CHEP19 proceedings paper](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202024506027). ### New pythonizations.

Also passes can be; replaced entirely so long as their task is complete as shown in this (more; customized) example pipeline. .. image:: pipeline-overview-customized.png. .. _maintainability-verifier:. MachineVerifier; ---------------. The pass approach lets us use the ``MachineVerifier`` to enforce invariants; that are required beyond certain points of the pipeline. For example, a; function with the ``legalized`` property can have the ``MachineVerifier``; enforce that no illegal instructions occur. Similarly, a; ``regBankSelected`` function may not have virtual registers without a register; bank assigned. .. note::. For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem. The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``. We can also go further still, as many of GlobalISel's passes are readily unit; testable:. .. image:: testing-unit-level.png.

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS; ------------------. .. option:: --debug. Run :program:`lit` in debug mode, for debugging configuration issues and; :program:`lit` itself. .. option:: --show-suites. List the discovered test suites and exit. .. option:: --show-tests. List all of the discovered tests and exit. EXIT STATUS; -----------. :program:`lit` will exit with an exit code of 1 if there are any FAIL or XPASS; results. Otherwise, it will exit with the status 0. Other exit codes are used; for non-test related failures (for example a user error or an internal program; error). .. _test-discovery:. TEST DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite.

Narrowing Down the Problem; While investigating a checker-related issue, instruct the analyzer to only; execute a single checker:. $ clang -cc1 -analyze -analyzer-checker=osx.KeychainAPI test.c.

Note: a fully qualified function name has to be used when selecting; C++ functions and methods, Objective-C methods and blocks, e.g.:. $ clang -cc1 -analyze -analyzer-checker=core test.cc -analyze-function='foo(int)'. The fully qualified name can be found from the; -analyzer-display-progress output. The bug reporter mechanism removes path diagnostics inside intermediate; function calls that have returned by the time the bug was found and contain; no interesting pieces.

Retained out parameters on zero return; The annotation LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO states; that a retained object is written into if and only if the function returns a zero value:. bool OSUnserializeXML(void *data, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO OSString **errString);. Then the caller has to release an object if the function has returned zero.; 4. Retained out parameters on non-zero return; Similarly, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_NONZERO specifies that a; retained object is written into the parameter if and only if the function has; returned a non-zero value.; Note that for non-retained out parameters conditionals do not matter, as the; caller has no obligations regardless of whether an object is written into or; not. Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler.

Testability,"ing established code added to the JIT can refer to printf; symbolically rather than requiring the address of printf to be ""baked in"".; This in turn allows cached versions of the JIT'd code (e.g. compiled objects); to be re-used across JIT sessions as the JIT'd code no longer changes, only the; absolute symbol definition does. For process and library symbols the DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator utility (See; :ref:`How to Add Process and Library Symbols to JITDylibs; <ProcessAndLibrarySymbols>`) can be used to automatically build absolute; symbol mappings for you. However the absoluteSymbols function is still useful; for making non-global objects in your JIT visible to JIT'd code. For example,; imagine that your JIT standard library needs access to your JIT object to make; some calls. We could bake the address of your object into the library, but then; it would need to be recompiled for each session:. .. code-block:: c++. // From standard library for JIT'd code:. class MyJIT {; public:; void log(const char *Msg);; };. void log(const char *Msg) { ((MyJIT*)0x1234)->log(Msg); }. We can turn this into a symbolic reference in the JIT standard library:. .. code-block:: c++. extern MyJIT *__MyJITInstance;. void log(const char *Msg) { __MyJITInstance->log(Msg); }. And then make our JIT object visible to the JIT standard library with an; absolute symbol definition when the JIT is started:. .. code-block:: c++. MyJIT J = ...;. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. JITStdLibJD.define(absoluteSymbols(SymbolMap({; { Mangle(""__MyJITInstance""),; { ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(&J), JITSymbolFlags() } }; });. Aliases and Reexports; ---------------------. Aliases and reexports allow you to define new symbols that map to existing; symbols.

Testability,"ing for loops, but we would; still need to filter out many more ourselves. We can do a good portion; of the remaining work with some cleverly chosen matchers, but first we; need to decide exactly which properties we want to allow. How can we characterize for loops over arrays which would be eligible; for translation to range-based syntax? Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable. The matcher for (2) is straightforward:; require a pre- or post-increment of the same variable declared in the; init portion. Unfortunately, such a matcher is impossible to write. Matchers contain; no logic for comparing two arbitrary AST nodes and determining whether; or not they are equal, so the best we can do is matching more than we; would like to allow, and punting extra comparisons to the callback. In any case, we can start building this sub-matcher. We can require that; the increment step be a unary increment like this:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""++""))). Specifying what is incremented introduces another quirk of Clang's AST:; Usages of variables are represented as ``DeclRefExpr``'s (""declaration; reference expressions"") because they are expressions which refer to; variable declarations. To find a ``unaryOperator`` that refers to a; specific declaration, we can simply add a second condition to it:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(; hasOperatorName(""++""),; hasUnaryOperand(declRefExpr()))). Furthermore, we can restrict our matcher to only match if the; incremented variable is an integer:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(; hasOperatorName(""++""),; hasUnaryOperand(declRefExpr(to(varDecl(hasType(isInteg",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst:11512,log,logic,11512,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

Next we hook it up as a primary expression:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParsePrimary() {; switch (CurTok) {; default:; return LogError(""unknown token when expecting an expression"");; case tok_identifier:; return ParseIdentifierExpr();; case tok_number:; return ParseNumberExpr();; case '(':; return ParseParenExpr();; case tok_if:; return ParseIfExpr();; }; }.

To motivate the code we want to produce, let's take a look at a simple; example. Consider:. ::. extern foo();; extern bar();; def baz(x) if x then foo() else bar();.

Testability,"ing is expected to change in a test. A follow-up patch with code changes to the compiler will then show check-line; differences to the tests, so it is easier to see the effect of the patch.; Remove TODO/FIXME comments added in the previous step if a problem is solved. Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``). Extra files; -----------. If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: split-file %s %t; ; RUN: llvm-link -S %t/a.ll %t/b.ll | FileCheck %s. ; CHECK: ... ;--- a.ll; ..",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:13963,test,tests,13963,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"ing to the analysis, throughput is limited by resource pressure and not by; data dependencies. The analysis observed increases in backend pressure during; 48.07% of the simulated run. Almost all those pressure increase events were; caused by contention on processor resources JFPA/JFPU0. The `critical sequence` is the most expensive sequence of instructions according; to the simulation. It is annotated to provide extra information about critical; register dependencies and resource interferences between instructions. Instructions from the critical sequence are expected to significantly impact; performance. By construction, the accuracy of this analysis is strongly; dependent on the simulation and (as always) by the quality of the processor; model in llvm. Bottleneck analysis is currently not supported for processors with an in-order; backend.

Here; are the typical use cases:. * You can [subscribe to a category or topic](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-subscribe-to-categories-and-topics/16024); * You can reply to a post, including quoting other peoples texts; ([tested](https://llvm.discourse.group/t/email-interaction-with-discourse/3306/4) on GMail).; * [Quoting previous topics in an reply](https://meta.discourse.org/t/single-quote-block-dropped-in-email-reply/144802); * You can filter incoming emails in your email client by category using the; `List-ID` email header field.; * You can create topics through email using the email address that is specific to the category. Each category description shows the email address to use, or you can use the mapping below. ## Mapping of email addresses to Discourse categories. Use these email addresses to create a topic by email in the specific discourse category. You **must** have a Discourse account associated with the email address you are sending from or the email will be rejected. <table border=1>; <tr><th>Discourse Category</th><th>Email Address</th></tr>; <tr><td>Beginner</td><td>beginners@discourse.llvm.org</td></tr>; <tr><td>LLVM Project</td><td>",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md:1632,test,tested,1632,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DiscourseMigrationGuide.md,1,['test'],['tested']

Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```. To use Clang frontend's PGO instead of LLVM IR PGO, set `-DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=OFF`. The `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` setting only affects the SPEC benchmark suites. Cross Compilation and External Devices; --------------------------------------. ### Compilation. CMake allows to cross compile to a different target via toolchain files. More; information can be found here:. - [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling). - [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html). Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command.

To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory.

Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it.

HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic). Both CLs+b and CLb are equivalent to these p-values, and the HypoTestResult has a simple switch SetBackgroundIsAlt() to specify the pairing between (null p-value, alternate p-value) and (CLb, CLs+b).

The extension is built using CMake to generate the usual LLVM.sln by setting; the following CMake vars:. - BUILD_CLANG_FORMAT_VS_PLUGIN=ON. - NUGET_EXE_DIR=path/to/nuget_dir (unless nuget.exe is already available in PATH). example:; cd /d C:\code\llvm; mkdir build & cd build; cmake -DBUILD_CLANG_FORMAT_VS_PLUGIN=ON -DNUGET_EXE_DIR=C:\nuget .. Once LLVM.sln is generated, build the clang_format_vsix target, which will build; ClangFormat.sln, the C# extension application. The CMake build will copy clang-format.exe and LICENSE.TXT into the ClangFormat/; directory so they can be bundled with the plug-in, as well as creating; ClangFormat/source.extension.vsixmanifest. Once the plug-in has been built with; CMake once, it can be built manually from the ClangFormat.sln solution in Visual; Studio. ===========; Debugging; ===========. Once you've built the clang_format_vsix project from LLVM.sln at least once,; open ClangFormat.sln in Visual Studio, then:. - Make sure the ""Debug"" target is selected; - Open the ClangFormat project properties; - Select the Debug tab; - Set ""Start external program:"" to where your devenv.exe is installed. Typically; it's ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe""; - Set ""Command line arguments"" to: /rootsuffix Exp; - You can now set breakpoints if you like; - Press F5 to build and run with debugger. If all goes well, a new instance of Visual Studio will be launched in a special; mode where it uses the experimental hive instead of the normal configuration hive.; By default, when you build a VSIX project in Visual Studio, it auto-registers the; extension in the experimental hive, allowing you to test it. In the new Visual Studio; instance, open or create a C++ solution, and you should now see the Clang Format; entries in the Tool menu. You can test it out, and any breakpoints you set will be; hit where you can debug as usual.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/tools/clang-format-vs/README.txt:1904,test,test,1904,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/tools/clang-format-vs/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/tools/clang-format-vs/README.txt,2,['test'],['test']

Note that as e-mail is the system of reference for code reviews, and some; people prefer it over a web interface, we do not generate automated mail; when a review changes state, for example by clicking ""Accept Revision"" in; the web interface. Thus, please type LGTM into the comment box to accept; a change from Phabricator. .. _pre-merge-testing:. Pre-merge testing; -----------------. The pre-merge tests are a continuous integration (CI) workflow. The workflow; checks the patches uploaded to Phabricator before a user merges them to the main; branch - thus the term *pre-merge testing*. When a user uploads a patch to Phabricator, Phabricator triggers the checks and; then displays the results. This way bugs in a patch are contained during the; code review stage and do not pollute the main branch. Our goal with pre-merge testing is to report most true problems while strongly; minimizing the number of false positive reports. Our goal is that problems; reported are always actionable. If you notice a false positive, please report; it so that we can identify the cause. If you notice issues or have an idea on how to improve pre-merge checks, please; `create a new issue <https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/issues/new>`_; or give a ❤️ to an existing one.

Testability,"ion for more information. .. _lit-infrastructure:. LIT INFRASTRUCTURE; ------------------. This section describes the :program:`lit` testing architecture for users interested in; creating a new :program:`lit` testing implementation, or extending an existing one. :program:`lit` proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running; arbitrary tests, and to expose a single convenient interface to these; tests. :program:`lit` itself doesn't know how to run tests, rather this logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected to populate. The following variables are also; available on the *config* object, some of which must be set by the config and; others are optional or predefined:. **name** *[required]* The name of the test suite, for use in reports and; diagnostics. **test_format** *[required]* The test ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:14552,Test,Test,14552,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,1,['Test'],['Test']

Otherwise, if there is an ``else``; reserved word, the statements following the ``else`` are processed. If the; value is false and there is no ``else`` arm, no statements are processed. Because the braces around the ``then`` statements are optional, this grammar rule; has the usual ambiguity with ""dangling else"" clauses, and it is resolved in; the usual way: in a case like ``if v1 then if v2 then {...} else {...}``, the; ``else`` associates with the inner ``if`` rather than the outer one. The :token:`IfBody` of the then and else arms of the ``if`` establish an; inner scope. Any ``defvar`` variables defined in the bodies go out of scope; when the bodies are finished (see `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details). The ``if`` statement can also be used in a record :token:`Body`. ``assert`` --- check that a condition is true; ---------------------------------------------. The ``assert`` statement checks a boolean condition to be sure that it is true; and prints an error message if it is not. .. productionlist::; Assert: ""assert"" `condition` "","" `message` "";"". If the boolean condition is true, the statement does nothing. If the; condition is false, it prints a nonfatal error message. The **message**, which; can be an arbitrary string expression, is included in the error message as a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class.

Testability,"ion is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible.

Function definitions and calls also work, but something went very wrong on that; last line. The call looks valid, so what happened? As you may have guessed from; the API a Module is a unit of allocation for the JIT, and testfunc was part; of the same module that contained anonymous expression. When we removed that; module from the JIT to free the memory for the anonymous expression, we deleted; the definition of ``testfunc`` along with it. Then, when we tried to call; testfunc a second time, the JIT could no longer find it. The easiest way to fix this is to put the anonymous expression in a separate; module from the rest of the function definitions. The JIT will happily resolve; function calls across module boundaries, as long as each of the functions called; has a prototype, and is added to the JIT before it is called. By putting the; anonymous expression in a different module we can delete it without affecting; the rest of the functions. In fact, we're going to go a step further and put every function in its own; module. Doing so allows us to exploit a useful property of the KaleidoscopeJIT; that will make our environment more REPL-like: Functions can be added to the; JIT more than once (unlike a module where every function must have a unique; definition).

In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not send or commit patches that use it.]*. Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test.

Line #2 does not require a definition, however, the second identifier lookup; fails. The implementation knows that `foo::bar` is in *libFoo*. It `dlopen`s; libFoo which in turn, during its static initialization, inserts annotated forward; declaration as shown in `G__Foo.cxx`. In turn, this resolves `foo::bar` and; parsing of `Foo.h` is again avoided at relatively small overhead. However, this; is very hard to measure because the dictionary of each library can have different; amount of content. In the case where the library is big and the annotated; forward declarations are many, and we want to include a relatively small header; file it may not pay off. Moreover, the loading of the annotated forward; declarations can happen at any time during parsing. This is nick-named; ""recursive parsing"" and is a code path that exists only in ROOT, never exercised; by clang itself and is thus not well tested. The behavior of line #2 is; equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] foo::bar/*store parsing state*/; gSystem->Load(""Foo"");; // More scaffolding.; extern int __Cling_AutoLoading_Map;; namespace foo{struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) bar;}; struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) S;; // More initialization scaffolding.; /*restore parsing state*/ *baz1;; ```. Line #3 requires a definition and the implementation behaves exactly as in #2.; Then it is informed that a definition is required, it reads the information in; the annotation and parses `Foo.h`.

The :program:`lit` output for a test run conforms to the following schema, in; both short and verbose modes (although in short mode no PASS lines will be; shown). This schema has been chosen to be relatively easy to reliably parse by; a machine (for example in buildbot log scraping), and for other tools to; generate. Each test result is expected to appear on a line that matches:. .. code-block:: none. <result code>: <test name> (<progress info>). where ``<result-code>`` is a standard test result such as PASS, FAIL, XFAIL,; XPASS, UNRESOLVED, or UNSUPPORTED. The performance result codes of IMPROVED and; REGRESSED are also allowed. The ``<test name>`` field can consist of an arbitrary string containing no; newline. The ``<progress info>`` field can be used to report progress information such; as (1/300) or can be empty, but even when empty the parentheses are required. Each test result may include additional (multiline) log information in the; following format:. .. code-block:: none. <log delineator> TEST '(<test name>)' <trailing delineator>; ... log message ...; <log delineator>. where ``<test name>`` should be the name of a preceding reported test, ``<log; delineator>`` is a string of ""*"" characters *at least* four characters long; (the recommended length is 20), and ``<trailing delineator>`` is an arbitrary; (unparsed) string. The following is an example of a test run output which consists of four tests A,; B, C, and D, and a log message for the failing test C:. .. code-block:: none. PASS: A (1 of 4); PASS: B (2 of 4); FAIL: C (3 of 4); ******************** TEST 'C' FAILED ********************; Test 'C' failed as a result of exit code 1.; ********************; PASS: D (4 of 4).

Testability,"ions in a ``RUN:``; line, lit makes only one pass through the substitution list by default. Thus,; if substitutions are not defined in the proper order, some will remain in the; ``RUN:`` line unexpanded. For example, the following directives refer to; ``%{inner}`` within ``%{outer}`` but do not define ``%{inner}`` until after; ``%{outer}``:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; By default, this definition order does not enable full expansion. ; DEFINE: %{outer} = %{inner}; ; DEFINE: %{inner} = expanded. ; RUN: echo '%{outer}'. ``DEFINE:`` inserts substitutions at the start of the substitution list, so; ``%{inner}`` expands first but has no effect because the original ``RUN:`` line; does not contain ``%{inner}``. Next, ``%{outer}`` expands, and the output of; the ``echo`` command becomes:. .. code-block:: shell. %{inner}. Of course, one way to fix this simple case is to reverse the definitions of; ``%{outer}`` and ``%{inner}``. However, if a test has a complex set of; substitutions that can all reference each other, there might not exist a; sufficient substitution order. To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list. Thus, in; the above example, setting the limit to 2 would cause lit to make a second pass; that expands ``%{inner}`` in the ``RUN:`` line, and the output from the ``echo``; command when then be:. .. code-block:: shell. expanded. To improve performance, lit will stop making passes when it notices the ``RUN:``; line has stopped changing. In the above example, setting the limit higher than; 2 is thus harmless. To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again. In the above example,; setting the limit to 1 will thus cause lit to report an error instead of; producing incorrect output. Options; -------.

The various options are explained in `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`. The; `.rootrc` file contents are combined. For example, if the flag to use; true type fonts is set to true in the `system.rootrc` file, you have; to set explicitly it false in your local `.rootrc` file if you do not; want to use true type fonts. Removing the `UseTTFonts `statement in; the local `.rootrc` file will not disable true fonts. The value of the; environment variable `ROOTDEBUG` overrides the value in the `.rootrc`; file at startup.

We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on GitHub).; * Inspect the repository history (blame, log, bisect) without Internet access.; * Maintain remote forks and branches on Git hosting services and; integrate back to the main repository. In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load. GitHub has one important advantage over GitLab and; BitBucket: it offers read-write **SVN** access to the repository; (https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).; This would enable people to continue working post-migration as though our code; were still canonically in an SVN repository.

An axis may be drawn independently of a histogram or a graph. This may; be useful to draw for example a supplementary axis for a graph. In this; case, one has to use the **`TGaxis`** class, the graphical; representation of an axis. One may use the standard constructor for this; kind of objects:. ``` {.cpp}; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; Double_t wmin, Double_t wmax, Int_t ndiv = 510,; Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength = 0); ```. The arguments `xmin, ymin` are the coordinates of the axis' start in the; user coordinates system, `and xmax, ymax` are the end coordinates. The; arguments `wmin` and `wmax` are the minimum (at the start) and maximum; (at the end) values to be represented on the axis; `ndiv` is the number; of divisions. The options, given by the ""`chopt`"" string are the; following:. - `chopt = 'G'`: logarithmic scale, default is linear. - `chopt = 'B'`: Blank axis (it is useful to superpose the axis). Instead of the `wmin,wmax` arguments of the normal constructor, i.e. the; limits of the axis, the name of a **`TF1`** function can be specified.; This function will be used to map the user coordinates to the axis; values and ticks. The constructor is the following:. ``` {.cpp}; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; const char* funcname, Int_t ndiv=510,; Option_t* chopt, Double_t gridlength=0); ```. In such a way, it is possible to obtain exponential evolution of the; tick marks position, or even decreasing. In fact, anything you like. ### Orientation of Tick Marks on Axis. Tick marks are normally drawn on the positive side of the axis, however,; if `xmin = xmax`, then negative. - `chopt = '+': ` tick marks are drawn on Positive side.

Define your statistic like this:. .. code-block:: c++. #define DEBUG_TYPE ""mypassname"" // This goes after any #includes.; STATISTIC(NumXForms, ""The # of times I did stuff"");. The ``STATISTIC`` macro defines a static variable, whose name is specified by; the first argument. The pass name is taken from the ``DEBUG_TYPE`` macro, and; the description is taken from the second argument. The variable defined; (""NumXForms"" in this case) acts like an unsigned integer. Whenever you make a transformation, bump the counter:. .. code-block:: c++. ++NumXForms; // I did stuff!. That's all you have to do.

Testability,"is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores. However, as most stores aren't interesting and don't; inherently leak data, this is expected to be prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details. There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These cond",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15166,test,test,15166,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['test'],['test']

Note that code ownership is completely different than reviewers: anyone can; review a piece of code, and we welcome code review from anyone who is; interested. Code owners are the ""last line of defense"" to guarantee that all; patches that are committed are actually reviewed.

It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links.

Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``).

The ``exhaustive`` attribute implies that any macro definitions; for macros not listed as configuration macros should be ignored; completely when building the module. As an optimization, the; compiler could reduce the number of unique module variants by not; considering these non-configuration macros. This optimization is not; yet implemented in Clang. A translation unit shall not import the same module under different definitions of the configuration macros. .. note::. Clang implements a weak form of this requirement: the definitions; used for configuration macros are fixed based on the definitions; provided by the command line. If an import occurs and the definition; of any configuration macro has changed, the compiler will produce a; warning (under the control of ``-Wconfig-macros``). **Example:** A logging library might provide different API (e.g., in the form of different definitions for a logging macro) based on the ``NDEBUG`` macro setting:. .. parsed-literal::. module MyLogger {; umbrella header ""MyLogger.h""; config_macros [exhaustive] NDEBUG; }.

Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on.

Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test.

Testability,"itABug`. Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work. Because of this, it may; appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications. ``bugpoint`` is; also designed to trade off programmer time for computer time in the; compiler-debugging process; consequently, it may take a long period of; (unattended) time to reduce a test case, but we feel it is still worth it. Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program. If any; LLVM passes are specified on the command line, it runs these passes on the test; program. If any of the passes crash, or if they produce malformed output (which; causes the verifier to abort), ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_. Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output. Once ``bugpoint`` has a reference output for the; test program, it tries executing it with the selected code generator. If the; selected code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_ on; the code generator. Otherwise, if the resulting output differs from the; reference output, it assumes the difference resulted from a code generator; failure, and starts the `code generator debugger`_. Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it. If its output differs from the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:1851,test,test,1851,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['test'],['test']

It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare. At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly. It; does this by coalescing contiguous ranges of set bits into intervals. Searching; for a bit in a CoalescingBitVector is O(log(gaps between contiguous ranges)). CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large. It's a better choice than SparseBitVector when find(); operations must have fast, predictable performance. However, it's not a good; choice for representing sets which have lots of very short ranges.

Testability,"ite MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it. In order to test the post register allocation; pseudo instruction expansion pass on X86-64, a run line like the one shown; below can be used:. ``# RUN: llc -o - %s -mtriple=x86_64-- -run-pass=postrapseudos | FileCheck %s``. The MIR files are target dependent, so they have to be placed in the target; specific test directories (``lib/CodeGen/TARGETNAME``). They also need to; specify a target triple or a target architecture either in the run line or in; the embedded LLVM IR module. Simplifying MIR files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Testability,"ith mutable variables. The short (and happy) summary of this chapter is that there is no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.2; }. In this example, the loads from the G and H global variables are; explicit in the LLVM IR, and they live in the then/else branches of the; if statement (cond\_true/cond\_false). In order to merge the incoming; values, the X.2 phi node in the cond\_next block selects the right value; to use based on where control flow is coming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form.

Note that this fuzz target does not depend on libFuzzer in any way; and so it is possible and even desirable to use it with other fuzzing engines; e.g. AFL_ and/or Radamsa_. Some important things to remember about fuzz targets:. * The fuzzing engine will execute the fuzz target many times with different inputs in the same process.; * It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).; * It must not `exit()` on any input.; * It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.; * It must be as deterministic as possible.
