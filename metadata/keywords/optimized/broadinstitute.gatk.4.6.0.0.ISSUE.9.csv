Energy Efficiency,"Thanks for the explanation. It isn't clear to me that the SAMRecord API was ever intended to support ; headerless records (except maybe in very rare corner cases). I don't really know the scope of hellbender. If it is just for internal ; DSDE tools development, then I guess it doesn't matter.; If you ever want to leverage code/libraries from elsewhere, then those ; would have to be ""headerless-aware"", I guess. For example, a common operation in Genome STRiP is to ask for the sample ; associated with a read. This requires the header, I would think.; Anyway, my main point was just to stimulate thinking about the value of ; implementing an efficient way to transmit the headers.; It also seems to me that this generalizes to efficient patterns to ; transmit any widely shared data (that is referenced by many serialized ; individual data items) out-of-band. -Bob.

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later. Job 5 *is* doing a lot of computation. It's turning each read into kmers and testing each of those kmers to see if they exist in a large hash table. I don't think there's much opportunity for further optimization -- I knew this would be a bottleneck and tried my best to make the code efficient.

Energy Efficiency,"The recent branch #8489 has demonstrated that there are some problematic edge cases in the pileup allele merging code that could cause pathological numbers of haplotypes to be handed to the genotyper. In updating the bug in that branch it was observed that it is very common that there are score ties at the 5th haplotype level for the pileupcaller as illustrated by the noise in the updated tests. This algorithm is not a good heuristic and we should replace it with something better, some ideas from that branch that might fix a few of its shortcomings:. 1) Increase/decouple the kmer size used with the reads from the assembly graph kmer size to prevent the filtering step from being redundant with assembly; 2) Normalize the scores to the haplotype lengths to deal with haplotype size bias.; 3) Change the scores to instead reflect the absolute count of unsupported kmers from the graph to also deal with hapotype size bias. ; 4) Iteratively expand the kmer size used for filtering to pare down the number of haplotypes in a more principled fashion.; 5) Utilize the read kmer occurrence counts to construct the scores in order to reduce the risk of spurious reads being sufficient support for a given haplotype. . We have observed that there can be significant changes to the actual genotyping engine output from the pileup engine from even relatively minor changes to the pileupcalling merging code.

Energy Efficiency,"The two main resources limiting how many gVCFs you can import at once will be memory and file handles. . I'm not sure if you mean incremental import or batch size when you mention the iterative approach. I assume the latter, but just want to clarify that there isn't any reason to break up the import using incremental import. The batch size parameter effectively does that, so you might as well import all gVCFs you have available (optionally using batch size if you're running out of memory). I'll throw out batch sizes of 50 or 100 as being reasonable, but the size of the intervals being imported will make a difference. It would be best to try to monitor how much memory is being used with those settings.

Energy Efficiency,"Thinking about this a bit more, we're actually quite close to a solution. In the existing Spark Mark Duplicates implementation, for example, you can set the parallelism (with -P). By default it is the same as the number of input partitions, but if the partitions are too large then each reducer has too much data to deal with and the job fails. This is why we made the number of partitions large by reducing the split size to 10MB. However, by increasing the number of reducers (by setting -P to be input data size/10MB), the input split size can be increased to its default of 128MB without causing a problem. So I think the work here is to work out a good set of defaults and the smallest number of knobs to override them. For example, I think we could always use the default split size, have some heuristics to choose a good value for the parallelism, and allow it to be overridden with -P.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1248#issuecomment-161988491:287,reduce,reducer,287,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1248#issuecomment-161988491,2,['reduce'],"['reducer', 'reducers']"
Energy Efficiency,"This PR contains fixes aimed at improving the performance of HaplotypeCaller at sites with a spanning deletion. There are three main changes:. * Modified the behavior of the `use-posteriors-to-calculate-qual` method for calculating QUAL. This method is supposed to assign a QUAL based on the posterior probabilities of genotypes which do not include a variant allele. In most cases, this set of genotypes is limited to HOM-REF. However, if a `*` allele is present at the site, it does not represent a variant allele at the locus in question (its QUAL is computed upstream at the deletion start site). Therefore, `use-posteriors-to-calculate-qual` should use any genotype that is composed of combinations of REF and `*` -- in the diploid case this would be `REF/REF`, `*/REF`, and `*/*`. This dramatically reduces the QUAL of sites that have a spanning deletion, as often most of the reads that don't support the variants beginning at the site support the overlapping deletion, increasing the likelihood of `REF/*` and `REF/REF`. This summation parallels that computed by `VariationalAlleleFrequencyCalculator`, which also special-cases `*` as an allele which does not contribute to the the likelihood of a variant allele at the site in question.; * Fixed a bug in `VariationalAlleleFrequencyCalculator` relating to summing across non-site specific variant alleles as mentioned above. An indexing problem was causing the calculator to sum `REF/REF` and `REF/*` genotypes but not `*/*` genotypes (in the diploid case).; * Added an option `limit-spanning-events-to-called-variants` to HaplotypeCaller. If enabled, the current implementation of this method only allows the `*` allele to be included in genotyping and QUAL calculations if at least one of the variants found in haplotypes overlapping the locus matches a deletion that was actually called upstream (without this option HaplotypeCaller reverts to its current behavior, which is to allow any haplotype with a deletion overlapping the location ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6816:805,reduce,reduces,805,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6816,1,['reduce'],['reduces']

Finally, the BAM files are concatenated together after writing an initial header. This is very similar to the approach that Hadoop-BAM takes, but adapted to work on Spark. I haven't done extensive benchmarking, but when I ran MD on a ~75MB BAM the runtime dropped from >30 mins to around 8 mins.

Energy Efficiency,"This is based on @davidadamsphd's initial work to port mark duplicates to Spark. It's not finished yet, but I wanted to post this for discussion. In particular 7 of the 56 mark duplicates integration tests are failing with ""Cannot get mate information for an unpaired read"" - I'm not sure how to address that. I'd appreciate some help on this one. The code currently has four shuffles: one groupBy in transformFragments (in MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils), two groupBys in transformReads, and one combine (foldByKey) in generateMetrics. The combine is more efficient than the others since it can run on the map side, reducing the amount of data that goes through the shuffle. I think it may be possible to merge the processing of the fragments and the reads to eliminate a shuffle - so there are only two shuffles for the main transform. A fragment would be represented as a pair with an empty second slot, so it can be handed in the processing separately from the true pairs that have both slots filled.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/889:551,efficient,efficient,551,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/889,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"Users (@yfarjoun @jnoms) have been reporting high run times in PathSeq when the samples have a large proportion (on the order of 10%+) of microbial reads. PathSeq was designed to run on samples with low numbers (<1%) microbial reads, but there are two ways users can currently improve performance when that's not the case:. 1) Run the 3 PathSeq tools individually (Filter, Align, and Score) instead of using `PathSeqPipelineSpark`, which simply runs those in series. This will eliminate over-allocation of resources during Filter and Score. This also will reduce the likelihood that Spark will recompute parts of the graph when it is low on memory/disk. ; 2) Enable `--skip-pre-bwa-repartition`, see https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_hellbender_tools_spark_pathseq_PathSeqPipelineSpark.php#--skip-pre-bwa-repartition; 3) Omit metric file outputs. This may also help Spark to avoid recomputing tasks from earlier parts of the graph. Planned features to help improve this:; 1) Automatically enable `--skip-pre-bwa-repartition` when a large amount of non-host reads is detected.; 2) Option to downsample the input BAM on the fly. This is also useful for estimating the proportion of non-host contamination.; 3) Option to limit the number of non-host reads that are processed. This is essentially equivalent to (2), but the downsampling would be performed after host filtering and could be used when the fraction of non-host reads is unknown a priori.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5780:556,reduce,reduce,556,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5780,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"We can split the tests up into a bunch of build units, but we get rapidly diminishing returns since we spend minutes installing things and building the artifacts for every vm. Travis doesn't have any notion of a build pipeline, so we can't say ""build the artifact on 1 vm and then share it and run the tests on these 10 vms"". Since we have a hard limit of the number of VMs we can use at a time for DSDE ( currently 15) being less efficient is very bad news. ( We could of course pay for more... I recently asked travis support if we could switch to an unlimited pay for usage model and they said no. ) We could also try optimizing wasted vm time by prebuilding dockers to run in, but that's additional complication. (maybe not to much, might be worth it). We also would need a scheme for dividing tests evenly between VM's. I tried writing a testng test listener to distribute them between N nodes based on the hashcode of the test class, for use on circleci, but it fell over and exploded for some reason that I never debugged. We could either debug it, or possibly split the tests by splitting the list of test files and then passing those in specifically. (May run into character limits for command lines... ). Balancing it is going to be tricky though in any case since the tests are very unevenly expensive. (We could probably manually balance it since there are a small number of slow tests and the rest are so fast they don't really matter) . The easiest thing would be to set the test to run in parallel on their existing vm. I can try turning it on again. I remember it caused problems before though, which I assume we haven't addressed. Each vm has 2 cores, so we might see some speedup. I suspect we may be using both cores to some degree already, since performance nearly doubled when we switched from the 1 core to 2 core build machines.

Energy Efficiency,"We recommend backing up data just because it is the ""cleanest"" way to roll back. If backing up data is really such a pain point, you could skip doing that. Just back up the callset.json file, and don't turn on `--consolidate` when you're doing incremental import. If a failure happens, just roll back the callset.json and re-do the import. The downside is that the failed import will hang around and take up disk space, but hopefully it is a rare enough occurrence that it doesn't matter - and you will have saved yourself backing up the data. In response to 2) - I guess you're implying that the overhead of cluster/job scheduling won't amortize any benefits from parallelism there? I suppose that could be true, but doesn't seem to be worth optimizing towards that. What I'm asking is whether split and merge are purely an instrument to allow you to choose the granularity of parallelism you want to use? Or is there something else? As I said before, we are considering enabling other ways to do distributed import which would work for the former. It might go something like:; - Create a workspace/initialize configuration+intervals to be imported; - Actually do the import by kicking off (multiple) import(s). User can pick the number of intervals each import is responsible for. User must ensure that no interval gets specified in multiple import processes. P.S: regarding 1000s of small contigs - the current GenomicsDBImport doesn't so so well with large number of contigs (unless you do concatenate the contigs into fewer groups).

It looks like there are a couple of things needed in GCS-NIO to use the NIO API for this.; 1. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/1450 so that we don't have to special-case `gs` URIs to remove everything except the scheme and host when looking up the filesystem (see https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L40); 2. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/813 to support path matching (https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L90).

We recommend multiprocess parallelism with an external job runner like [cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) if you want parallelism in tools that aren't ready in spark yet. This is more complicated to setup and run, but it results in much more efficient use of compute resources. There are few limited multithreaded options remaining in GATK4 outside of spark.

I have benchmarked pretty thoroughly and discovered that caching `GenotypeAlleleCounts` for the sake of iterating in sequence is totally pointless. The `GenotypeAlleleCounts::increase` method is already so efficient that it makes no difference. In fact, caching is slower than using `increase` when the allele count and ploidy yield more than a few hundred genotypes.

So you'll see it's progressing, but ~38 variants/min if I read this right. A few other things to note:. - FWIW, this is using a GATK JAR I built locally using #7962, which has some minor changes to side-step a bug in GenotypeGVCFs. Those changes only touch two annotation classes. - GenomicsDB 1.4.4 mentions memory improvements - any reason to think trying that would make a difference?. - One other thing to mention is that the MMul10 genome has ~2900 contigs. I dont understand precisely why this is a problem for GenomicsDB, but that has come up. Since we're only working on one contig (and usually a fraction of a contig) per job, could I subset my workspace to coax GenomicsDB to think it only has one contig? I believe I could just copy the contig folder and touch up the metadata JSON? I realize this isnt a great solution, but we're completely blocked here in terms of genotyping our data. - If SelectVariants actually worked here, could I run SelectVariants on the GenomicsDB workspace to create a combined gVCF for my ~2m site interval, and then run GenotypeGVCFs against this subset? It's not especially efficient, but if SelectVariants can pass and produce an output that's valid for GenotypeGVCFs that would actually be quite useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1209854842:4739,efficient,efficient,4739,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1209854842,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"`AFCalculator` has a couple of methods that don't belong: `reduceScope()`, which is called _before_ the AF calculation to reduce its computational burden, and `subsetAlleles()`, which is called _after_ the calculation to eliminate alleles that don't exist in called genotypes (in conformance with the dubious VCF spec). These methods are chronologically distinct from the rest of `AFCalculator` and do not appear to use any private variables. Thus they could easily be turned into static methods and removed from `AFCalculator`. Furthermore, `reduceScope()` and `subsetAlleles()` each have two implementations, in `DiploidExactAFCalculator` and `GeneralPloidyExactAFCalculator`. Since these two cases are complementary, they could easily be merged in a single method with an `if (ploidy == 2) . . .`. Finally, the general ploidy code is more complicated than it needs to be and needs editing. Beyond general housekeeping, the main motivation here is to untangle the AF/qual code as much as possible _without_ changing behavior before introducing the new model into the mix (issue #1697).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1891:59,reduce,reduceScope,59,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1891,3,['reduce'],"['reduce', 'reduceScope']"

Energy Efficiency,"`VariantsSparkSink` will always sort variants before writing them out. However, `HaplotypeCallerSpark` always processes reads in coordinate-sorted order, and produces variants in the same order, so there is no need for `VariantsSparkSink` to sort variants. (In fact, in GVCF mode the sort is prohibitive since the engine creates a variant for every locus over the interval of interest, which go through the sort step before being merged into GVCF bands.). This PR removes the sort step for `HaplotypeCallerSpark` (and `PrintVariantsSpark`, which doesn't need it either). All of the concordance unit tests pass, and as an additional sanity check I compared the GVCF output from running regular `HaplotypeCaller` on a large input BAM to `HaplotypeCallerSpark` (with and without variant sorting). Removing variant sorting actually made the GVCF output more similar to regular `HaplotypeCaller` - it reduced the number of differences from three to one. (The one difference is a minor difference in QUAL due to a boundary artifact.)

Energy Efficiency,"action model to allow for the modeling of hom sites. I wrote up such a model in some notes I sent around a few months back. This model allows for an allelic PoN that uses all sites to learn reference bias, not just hets. Depending on how our python development proceeds, I may try to implement this model using the old `GibbsSampler` code instead.; - [x] In the meantime, we can try to speed up the old allele-fraction model, which is now the main bottleneck. An easy (lazy) strategy might simply be to downsample and scale likelihoods when estimating global parameters. Addresses #2884.; - [x] Even though the simple copy-ratio model is much faster, it still takes ~15-20 minutes for 100 iterations on WGS, so we can downsample here too.; - [x] Integration tests are still needed; again, these might not test for correctness.; - I've added the ability to specify a prior for the minor-allele fraction, which alleviates the problem of residual bias in balanced segments.; - I've reduced the verbosity of the modeled-segments file. I only report posterior mode and 10%, 50%, and 90% deciles. Global parameters have the full deciles output in the .param files, but I removed the mode and highest density credible interval (because of the below item).; - [x] Some residual bias remains in the estimate of the minor-allele fraction posterior mode. This is simply because we are performing kernel density estimation of a bounded quantity. One possibility would be to logit transform to an unbounded support, perform the estimation, then transform back. EDIT: Just removed kernel density estimation for now, partly due to #3599 as well.; - Hmm, actually still a tiny bit of residual bias. This is apparent e.g. in WGS normals. I think focusing on a new allele-fraction model rather than trying to figure out where the old one is failing would be best.; - [x] For small bins (250bp), the copy-ratio model is currently a bit memory intensive, since it stores an outlier indicator boolean for every data point",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828:6221,reduce,reduced,6221,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

I think it is most effective to make people ""feel"" the difference, i.e. output like ""you have been waiting 1324s or 60% of additional processing time on this step due to compression"".; Or ""Processing still hasn't started due to compression/decompression."". GATK4, especially on Spark hides that pretty well.; For example, turning off Spark lz4 and relying on ZFS lz4 for the writing of temporary data was instructive about how much CPU was used for it (not that much). 2. Compression differences:; I might help to look at the used dictionary size for the differences and also the possible method of compression parallelization. Multi-core compression mostly cuts files into pieces and can greatly decrease compression if the data is highly repetitive. Because another core starts anew on data that the previous one might have reduced to almost nothing (zstd allows some sharing of the dictionary between cores, but most do not I think). Example about the dictionary difference: For long distance repetitive files, compression with; xz --lzma2=preset=1,dict=1500M can bringe a huge gain in compression, but still be much faster than level 9 (which has normally only a dictionary of 64MB). Compression levels are correlated with dict size for most compressors to ensure monotonically increasing memory usage, but that doesn't have to be so.; zstd, for example, allows many parameters to change this. Even more than xz. I suspect due to my experiments that quality values gain more from increased dictionary size, because they are more repetitive than the DNA data. And shorter BAMs would be different because they are less repetitive (usually less coverage), so their compression relies more on CPU-expensive crunching of the ""2bit nature"" of the DNA.; So they might logically suffer more from a lower compression level.; It might be instructive ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3413#issuecomment-360179673:1109,reduce,reduced,1109,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3413#issuecomment-360179673,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Energy Efficiency,"c.). The run can be found in /dsde/working/slee/wgs-pon-test/tieout/no-gc. It completed successfully with **-Xmx32G** (in comparison, CreatePanelOfNormals crashed after 40 minutes with -Xmx128G). The runtime breakdown was as follows:. - ~45 minutes simply from reading of the 90 TSV read-count files in serial. Hopefully #3349 should greatly speed this up. (In comparison, CombineReadCounts reading 10 files in parallel at a time took ~100 minutes to create the aforementioned 20GB combined TSV file, creating 25+GB of temp files along the way.). - ~5 minutes from the preprocessing and filtering steps. We could probably further optimize some of this code in terms of speed and heap usage. (I had to throw in a call to System.gc() to avoid an OOM with -Xmx32G, which I encountered in my first attempt at the run...). - ~5 minutes from performing the SVD of the post-filtering 8643028 x 86 matrix, maintaining 30 eigensamples. I could write a quick implementation of randomized SVD, which I think could bring this down a bit (the scikit-learn implementation takes <2 minutes on a 10M x 100 matrix), but this can probably wait. Clearly making I/O faster and more space efficient is the highest priority. Luckily it's also low hanging fruit. The 8643028 x 30 matrix of eigenvectors takes <2 minutes to read from HDF5 when the WGS PoN is used in DenoiseReadCounts, which gives us a rough idea of how long it should take to read in the original ~11.5M x 90 counts from HDF5. So once #3349 is in, then I think that a **~15 minute single-core WGS PoN could easily be viable**. I believe that a PoN on the order of this size will be all that is required for WGS denoising, if it is not already overkill. To go bigger by more than an order of magnitude, we'll have to go out of core, which will require more substantial changes to the code. But since the real culprit responsible for hypersegmentation is CBS, rather than insufficient denoising, I'd rather focus on finding a viable segmentation alternative.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-317614503:1499,efficient,efficient,1499,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-317614503,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Especially the last one about the AVX instruction set where it says that a **MUCH** slower implementation will be used. From the few WARN messages it seems like the root cause is the failure to load libgkl and that again seems to be related to my platform. From another thread/topic I concluded that the instruction set problem might be gone if libgkl could be loaded. Does anyone know more about this issue or how to work around it?.

Energy Efficiency,"d by some of the discussion and work by @mbabadi in #4558, I quickly revisited the revision of the ploidy model. The key difference is now we use the per-contig coverage *histogram* (rather than just the per-contig total coverage). This histogram conveys a lot more information and, with some naive filtering (see more discussion in #4558), provides relatively easy peaks to fit. I think this is a better solution than subsampling intervals and fitting a model that would require modeling per-interval bias. Another key change I added was to provide *per-genotype* priors, rather than per-contig priors. For the autosomes, this is immaterial, but it's extremely useful for the allosomes. That is, we currently provide per-contig priors like so:. ````; CONTIG PLOIDY_0 PLOIDY_1 PLOIDY_2 PLOIDY_3; 1 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0; ...; X 0.01 0.48 0.48 0.01; Y 0.48 0.48 0.01 0.01; ````. However, note that this implies that X and XXY are just as probable as XX and XY! It's much more powerful to be able to specify *per-genotype* priors (although this requires a bit more bookkeeping when translating to implications for per-contig histograms):. ````; CONTIG_SET PLOIDY_STATE RELATIVE_PROBABILITY; (1) (2) 1.0; ...; (X,Y) (2,0) 1.0; (X,Y) (1,1) 1.0; (X,Y) (1,0) 0.01; (X,Y) (2,1) 0.01; (X,Y) (1,2) 0.01; (X,Y) (3,0) 0.01; ````. We then fit the per-contig coverage histograms across all samples with the appropriate negative-binomial distributions corresponding to a sparse mixture of genotypes, while accounting for 1) sample-specific depth (which determines the means of the negative-binomial distributions), 2) multiplicative contig-specific bias (which is mild, at least for WGS), and 3) additive sample-contig-specific mosaicism or bias (note that the above genotype priors imply that mosaicism/bias on top of a baseline of CN = 2 is the only deviation allowed for the autosomes, which is somewhat restrictive but greatly aids convergence). I put together a pure PyMC3 prototype that seems to work relatively wel",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376278271:977,power,powerful,977,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376278271,1,['power'],['powerful']

Should we seek professional (release engineering) help?. ---. @akiezun commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215761749). only 4 seems remotely sane to me. ---. @vdauwera commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215779225). 3 and 4 both produce an acceptable result for me but I could see 3 being too hard on the dev team. So I'll go with 4. I think the inconvenience of cutting a special cherry picked release is enough to dissuade casual/unnecessary releases, but low enough to not be a blocker if we really do need to release a hot fix. ---. @LeeTL1220 commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215793338).

I could do number three. ---. @akiezun commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215801993). To clarify my position though - I think we should just never need it and simply coordinate between the various tool teams on a common release schedule. The toolkit would then be released because all tool are ready. ---. @droazen commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215816252). @akiezun We should strive for this, but in practice there will be times when Lee needs a release and we're not ready for one, and we need to have a plan in place to deal with that scenario.

Energy Efficiency,"e typically used to indicate adapter sequence. See reply to jhess in <https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/comment/35120#Comment_35120>:. > That's correct, Q2 bases are considered to be special and left untouched by BQSR. Currently, there is no easy way to convert base qualities to two. The only instances I am aware of is (i) for SamToFastq, which then unaligns the reads and (ii) MergeBamAlignment, which isn't necessarily a part of everyone's workflow. Also, MergeBamAlignment's `CLIP_ADAPTERS` softclips XT tagged sequence, which then becomes fair game for our assembly-based callers. MarkIlluminaAdapters uses aligned reads to mark those with 3' adapter sequence with the XT tag. The XT tag values note the start of the 3' adapter sequence in the read. During MergeBamAlignment, one must especially request that this XT tag is retained in the merged output. Because our assembly-based callers throw out CIGAR strings from the aligner when reassembling reads, so as to use soft-clipped sequence that may contain true variants we wish to resolve, adapter sequence can be incorporated into the graph. This is not an issue for libraries with low levels of adapter read through and for germline calling as we prune nodes in the graph that have less than two reads supporting it. . However, for somatic cases and for libraries where there is considerable adapter read through, the current solution is to hard-clip adapter sequences out of reads or to toss these reads altogether so as not to increase the extent of spurious calls. The issue with hard-clipping is that our reads become malformed due to a mismatch in CIGAR string and sequence length. These the GATK engine filters. So the solution is to either correct the CIGAR strings or to go back and re-align the clipped reads or again to toss the reads. It would be great not to have to throw out reads that include some adapter sequence in somatic workflows that call down to the lowest allele fraction variants.

Energy Efficiency,"erent results by the first filtering step (on intervals by interval median). @LeeTL1220 @davidbenjamin what is the ""official ReCapSeg"" behavior, and do we want to keep the current behavior? In general, I think all of the standardization (i.e., filtering/imputation/truncation/transformation) steps could stand some revisiting. Evaluation:. - [ ] Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - [x] <s>Investigate the effect of keeping duplicates. I am still not sure why we do this, and it may have a more drastic impact on WGS data.</s> Turns out we don't keep duplicates for WGS; see #3367.; - [ ] Check that GC-bias-correction+PCA and PCA-only perform comparably, even at small bin sizes (~300bp). From what I've seen, this is true for larger bin sizes (~3kbp), so explicit GC-bias correction may not be necessary. (That is, even at these (purportedly) large bin sizes, the effect of the read-based GC-bias correction is obvious for those samples where it is important. However, the end result is not very different from PCA-only denoising with no GC-bias correction performed.); - [x] <s>Check that changing CBS alpha parameter sufficiently reduces hypersegmentation.</s> <s>Looks like the hybrid p-value calculation in DNACopy is not accurate enough to handle WGS-size data. (Also, it's relatively slow, taking ~30 minutes on ~10M intervals.) Even if I set alpha to 0, I still get a ridiculous number of segments! So I think it's finally time to scrap CBS. I'll look into other R segmentation packages that might give us a quick drop-in solution, but we may want to roll our own simple algorithm (which we will scrap anyway once the coverage model is in for somatic).</s> I've implemented a fast kernel-segmentation method that seems very promising, see below.; - [ ] Investigate performance vs. CGA ReCapSeg pipeline on THCA samples.; - [ ] Investigate concordance with Genome STRiP.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:5171,reduce,reduces,5171,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,1,['reduce'],['reduces']
Energy Efficiency,"ersion(s); - 4.2 through 4.6. ### Description ; We tried to run GenotypeGVCFs from GATK 4.5 with `-all-sites` on a dataset with 120 samples and GRCh37 as the reference. Each run was limited to a single chromosome. All of them failed after consuming 3 TB of memory. Subsequently, I tried a smaller subset of 8 samples limiting the memory to 32 GB and all the runs failed after 3-10 Mbp depending on the chromosome. Finally, I randomly picked chromosome 9 and used GATK versions from 4.1 to 4.6 and only 4.1 did not experience the problem. It finished the whole chromosome (141 Mbp) with the max memory usage of around 8 GB. All others failed after 3-6 Mbp (Sorry, I used different memory settings for 4.5, so I did not include it.). ![memory_usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df354842-d420-4a99-b3d3-01fec64d18fd). Time is in seconds, memory is in MB. If I run the same command without `-all-sites`, the maximum memory usage is around 1.6 GB. #### Steps to reproduce. GenomicDB was created using the corresponding GATK version as:. ```; gatk --java-options ""-Xmx12000m"" GenomicsDBImport --genomicsdb-workspace-path tmp/genomicsdb44/9 \; --genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations --batch-size 120 --verbosity DEBUG \; -L 9 -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/1.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/2.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/3.g.vcf.gz \; -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/4.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/5.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/6.g.vcf.gz \; -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/7.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/8.g.vcf.gz; ```. GenotypeGVCFs was run as:. ```; gatk --java-options ""-Xmx12g"" GenotypeGVCFs -R data/ref/hs37d5.fa.gz \; -V gendb://tmp/genomicsdb44/9 -O data/gatk/variants/9/raw44.vcf.gz -L 9 \; --tmp-dir ./tmp/tmp -all-sites; ```. All runs were performed with resource_monitor and it was instructed to kill the process if it consumes more than 14000 MB of memory. Thus, at least 2 GB was allocated for reading GenomicsDB. The size of the GenomicsDB on disk is around 3.1 GB for versions >=4.2 and 3.0 GB for version 4.1.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8989:1965,allocate,allocated,1965,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8989,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

Energy Efficiency,"far have shown that there are lots of; configuration points where one or the other performs poorly; the onus is on; finding the good configuration values that result in better performance, or; identifying which algorithms may be performant for a larger range of; parameter choices. To maximize understanding I would suggest that we not change too many; parameters at a time. For example it seems unnecessary to have multiple; variants of the 128Mbp input. I found there can be significant (>50%) variation between identical runs.; One way to reduce this is to set spark.task.maxFailures=1 which I strongly; recommend for all experiments going forward. One concern I have is that our cluster memory is already far larger than; the input size. In fact here each machine can fit the whole input; comfortably in RAM. This is not going to be the case for the full input.; Since it would take too long to iterate using the full input, it seems wise; instead to reduce both the input size and to keep a close eye on the amount; of memory we're using to make sure we're not going down a path that would; not be able to cope with the full input.

Energy Efficiency,"he superclass, but for `AssemblyRegionWalker` it was the unit of I/O and `AssemblyRegion` was the unit of processing, and I couldn't update the docs for `ReadWindowWalker` to clear up the confusion without mentioning `AssemblyRegion`-specific concepts.; - The `ReadShard` / `ReadWindow` was/is **only** there to prove that we can shard the data without introducing calling artifacts, and to provide a unit of parallelism for the upcoming Spark implementation. It's not something we really want to expose to users as a prominent knob, and we may hide it completely in the future once the shard size is tuned for performance.; - Inheriting from a more abstract walker type caused a number of other problems as well: methods that should have been final in the supertype could no longer be made final, with the result that tool implementations could inappropriately override engine initialization/shutdown routines. Also, there were issues with the progress meter, since both the supertype traversal and subtype traversal needed their own progress meter for their different units of processing. Ultimately it was just too awkward and forced, and the read shard is something that we eventually want to make an internal/encapsulated implementation detail anyway. GATK3 made the mistake, I think, of using long, confusing inheritance chains for its walker types, with the result that you got awkward and forced relationships like `RodWalker` inheriting from `LocusWalker`. It's better, I think, to make each traversal as standalone as possible, especially given the simplicity of writing a new walker type in GATK4. For all of these reasons we don't want `AssemblyRegionWalker` to inherit from a more abstract traversal type -- it's just going to be its own standalone thing, so that it can evolve freely without affecting anyone else. For `SlidingWindowWalker`, which we still want to merge, I recommend making the traversal do **exactly** what you want for your use case, as clearly and simply as possible,",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513:1712,meter,meter,1712,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513,2,['meter'],['meter']

Some other tools cannot specify intervals if these are very specific... for example in exome analysis targets do not fall at regular intervals and are tailor to the capture used. In this case explicit listing is not avoidable. However there are ways to gain. For one thing the language above allows to pack intervals on the same contig on the block so saving to specify the name at each line. (e.g. ```chr1 { 100-200 3124-5681 ... }````. . However real gains would come from ""publishing"" those list under some unique identifier or stable URL that reduce the need of marshaling the whole interval-file file every time.

Energy Efficiency,"is for the number of bias covariates _and_ how to take these numbers and project an approximate memory usage. 2. It would appear that GermlineCNVCaller will, by default, attempt to use all CPU cores available on the machine. From the WDL I see that setting environment variables `MKL_NUM_THREADS` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` seems to control the parallelism? It would be nice if `GermlineCNVCaller` took a `--threads` and then set these before spawning the python process. 3. Runtime? This would be really nice to have some guidelines around as I get wildly varying results depending on how I'm running. My experimentation is with a) 20 45X WGS samples, b) bin size = 500bp, c) running on a 96-core general purpose machine at AWS with 384GB of memory. My first attempt a) scattered the genome into 48 shards of approximately 115k bins each, representing ~50mb of genome and b) ran 24 jobs concurrently but failed to set the environment variables to control parallelism. In that attempt the first wave of jobs were still running after 24 hours and getting close to finishing up the initial de-noising epoch, with 3/24 having failed due to memory allocation failures. My second attempt, now running, scattered the genome into 150 shards, and is running 12 jobs at a time with 8 cores each and the environment variables set. On the second attempt it looks like the jobs will finish the first denoising epoch in < 1 hour each. That's far faster than the 6x reduction in runtime you might expect if a) runtime is linear in the number of bins and b) runtime is proportional to 1/cpus used. Without doing a lot more experiments it's hard to tell whether the better runtime is due to less fighting over resources (I can imagine 24 jobs each running 96 threads could degrade performance) or because runtime is super-linear vs. number of bins. I'm not asking for total precision, but the current docs are not really enough for anyone outside the GATK team to get the CNV caller up and running in an efficient manner.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6166:2815,efficient,efficient,2815,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6166,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

It seems that this missed variant is a assembly problem. The region has quite a few events resulting in very complex graphs with may possible haplotypes. . If one adds the -debug -l DEBUG options you can see in the logs that the number of haplotypes for kmer size 10 hits the default maximum of 128. If one increases the limit to 512 ```(-maxNumHaplotypesInPopulation 512)``` then the variant comes up in the output. . When such a limit is hit, we reduce the number of haplotypes for further analysis using an algorithm that calculates a pseudo likelihood based on the reads that support different paths in the graph. . One would hope that this algorithm would pick up at least one of the haplotypes that contain that variant amongst the top 128 haplotypes for any kmer size, however in this instance this is not the case. So we need to verify that that algorithm is doing what is supposed to do and if so, whether we can change the way such a pseudo likelihood is calculated in order to make a better selection for this case and in general. ---. @vruano commented on [Wed Dec 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-265535122). Also increase the kmer size to 35 does the job (-kmerSize 35) I guess that that prevents non-ref paths merge back into the reference between events thus resulting in less complex graphs. ---. @vruano commented on [Wed Dec 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-265535498).

Energy Efficiency,"k the `Optimized` version deals with avoiding replicating reads in a more nuanced manner, but if I understand correctly, it doesn't seem to me to avoid the shuffle. It looks like it essentially ignores the concept of data locality entirely, and potentially transfers a lot of data over the network. (Equivalent to performing a shuffle on a sorted file in HDFS.). IMO, the current ""shuffle"" implementation is already a ""Spark-y"" way to do it, but with multiple inefficiencies:; - Reads/variants are keyed to their corresponding shards, replicating reads if they cross over shard boundaries. This necessitates an `aggregateByKey` operation that potentially reshuffles the entire data set at the end to deal with neighboring shards that could be hashed to different machines.; - The impl uses `cogroup` and `groupByKey`, which require materializing all values for a key in memory (which could be large). Best to avoid these if possible.; - And related to the previous issue, the join strategy for reads and variants is basically a cross-product-and-filter, which is not very efficient, especially considering that the data can be ordered. I think the best implementation here would steal JP's method of sharding the reads/variants, but make use of `repartitionAndSortWithinPartition`, which lets you specify what partition to use and also sorts all the values within a given partition. This means that we could employ a sort-merge on each partition, and only scan through the datasets once after shuffling them. Do you already have an impl for doing a sort-merge of `Locatable`s? These can be a bit tricky. I wrote one for the `ShuffleRegionJoin` impl in ADAM, but there are semantic differences that would make it less efficient to use. (Specifically, it would require the `aggregateByKey` operation and also creating `SimpleInterval`-style objects from a separate model.).

Energy Efficiency,"latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're using a single gold-standard sample, this should definitely be more straightforward. In any case, the optimal validation LL score at ~0.02 does appear to line up quite well visually with where one might manually set a threshold. It corresponds pretty well with the trans",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1067396431:1980,green,green,1980,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1067396431,1,['green'],['green']

Energy Efficiency,"lla BaseRecalibrator works just fine on these bams (so I don't think the issue is with the bam). They are all suffering from the same/similar stacktrace. We've had BaseRecalibratorSpark work fine on other bam files. Additionally, changing the number of threads still results in the same stacktrace. I've also tried running the BQSRPipelineSpark to see if that would suffer the same issue and it fails in the same manner. Additionally, I've run ValidateSamFile. There are some reads missing their mates, but this hasn't presented an issue in other tools (including vanilla BaseRecalibrator). Searching thru the forum, I found an old issue with a similar stacktrace, but that issue appears to occur in GATK 2.4: https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/3265/bqsrgatherer-exception.

Energy Efficiency,"nted on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217265362). It seems to me that a quick and sound solution is to reduce the number of alternative alleles at this point in HCGenotypeEngine code:. ```; HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine.java line 260:; final Map<Allele, List<Haplotype>> alleleMapper = createAlleleMapper(mergeMap, eventMapper);; ```. Haplotypes have associated score, as a pseudo-likelihood,that can be use to sort then and selectively remove those alternative alleles that are only supported by the less likely haplotypes. ---. @vruano commented on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217266027). So the idea is simple, keep removing haplotypes from that map value lists one by one until enough allele's are emptied, so that the number of genotypes does not surpasses a maximum based on the largest ploidy amongst the input samples. Of course, one would need to create some temporary data-structure to make the operation more efficient. . ---. @vruano commented on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217267297). Those haplotype scores have not been throughly analyzed but we are already using them to discard haplotypes beyond the maximum allowed per graph kmer size so I don't see the harm in using the for further reduction. . Certainly is a step forward from just throwing an exception back to the user. However, we should output a Warning every time we need to do such a reduction just to keep track. ---. @sooheelee commented on [Fri May 06 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217443170).

Energy Efficiency,"o be special and left untouched by BQSR. Currently, there is no easy way to convert base qualities to two. The only instances I am aware of is (i) for SamToFastq, which then unaligns the reads and (ii) MergeBamAlignment, which isn't necessarily a part of everyone's workflow. Also, MergeBamAlignment's `CLIP_ADAPTERS` softclips XT tagged sequence, which then becomes fair game for our assembly-based callers. MarkIlluminaAdapters uses aligned reads to mark those with 3' adapter sequence with the XT tag. The XT tag values note the start of the 3' adapter sequence in the read. During MergeBamAlignment, one must especially request that this XT tag is retained in the merged output. Because our assembly-based callers throw out CIGAR strings from the aligner when reassembling reads, so as to use soft-clipped sequence that may contain true variants we wish to resolve, adapter sequence can be incorporated into the graph. This is not an issue for libraries with low levels of adapter read through and for germline calling as we prune nodes in the graph that have less than two reads supporting it. . However, for somatic cases and for libraries where there is considerable adapter read through, the current solution is to hard-clip adapter sequences out of reads or to toss these reads altogether so as not to increase the extent of spurious calls. The issue with hard-clipping is that our reads become malformed due to a mismatch in CIGAR string and sequence length. These the GATK engine filters. So the solution is to either correct the CIGAR strings or to go back and re-align the clipped reads or again to toss the reads. It would be great not to have to throw out reads that include some adapter sequence in somatic workflows that call down to the lowest allele fraction variants. It seems this would simply be a matter of a tool or feature that replaces adapter sequence marked with the XT tag with base qualities of 2 and special handling by our callers of sequence with base quality of two.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3540:1252,adapt,adapter,1252,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3540,5,['adapt'],['adapter']
Energy Efficiency,"o how is it obsolete?. Reply by @SHUANG-Broad (also copied to update the ""TODO"" message; > this predicate is currently used in two places (excluding appearance in comments): `BreakpointComplications.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointComplications`, where it is use to test if the input simple chimera indicates an inverse tandem duplication and trigger the logic for inferring duplicated region; and `BreakpointsInference.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointInference`, where it is used for breakpoint inference. The problem is, the contig will not even be sent here, because `AssemblyContigWithFineTunedAlignments.hasIncompletePictureFromTwoAlignments()` defines a simple chimera that has strand switch and the two alignments overlaps on reference as ""incomplete"", so in practice the two uses are not going to be triggered. But when we come back later and see what can be extracted from such ""incomplete"" contigs, these code could be useful again. So it is kept. ------------; ### On the problem of writing out SAM records of ""Unknown"" contigs efficiently. First round comment by @cwhelan ; > This seems like a very inefficient way to write these three files. You end up calling collect on the RDD three different times and then traversing the local collection three times. Why not make a map of contig name to bam file, collect the rdd once, and then traverse the local collection once, writing each read to the appropriate bam file from the map?. Second round comment by @cwhelan ; > This is a better but you are still collecting the RDD and passing over the collection three times. What I meant by my original suggestion was this: Why not make the map go the other way, ie make a Map<String, ReasonForAlignmentClassificationFailure> that maps contig names to their reasons? Then make a Map<ReasonForAlignmentClassificationFailure, SAMFileWriter> with three entries. Then you only have to iterate over the collection of reads once to write everything out (you just look up the writer for each entry).

Energy Efficiency,"olders named ""SAMPLE_#""), and just check the sample_name.txt files at the PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls step. I don't think this should require GermlineCNVCaller code changes, right?. 4) We may require additional code at the WDL level if we want to both switch over to primarily using sample names but also get rid of bundling (i.e., by passing only the calls for each sample when needed). Locally, you can always just search all output for directories containing the appropriate sample_name.txt. But on the cloud, you'd want to make sure that the postprocessing step for a particular sample gets only its corresponding directories, which would have to happen at the WDL level; the check against sample_name.txt at the tool level would just be a formality. I can foresee headaches with globbing and funky sample names. I'm not sure I understand your point about extending PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to run on all samples. The point of that tool is to take results from all genomic shards for a single sample and stitch them together, right? Even if we extend this to run on a batch of multiple samples (which would just be moving the loop over samples at the WDL level to some lower level, i.e., Java or python), we still need to see all shards for those samples. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding---can you clarify?. @mwalker174 can we once and for all clearly document the issue with the transpose? Perhaps by pointing to specific WGS runs that have issues with call caching? I think being able to pinpoint the exact issue will help us identify the right solution---whether that be choosing an appropriate bundling scheme, taking advantage of #5781 to reduce the number of shards, batching during the postprocessing step, removing unnecessary outputs, etc. Recall that we'd like to be able to use the same WDL locally (when you have easy access to all GermlineCNVCaller results from all genomic shards) and in the cloud, with minimal duplication of output from bundling when running locally, if possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6659#issuecomment-644829765:2968,reduce,reduce,2968,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6659#issuecomment-644829765,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"on **data representation**:. @laserson: yes, I think it makes total sense to eventually move to a better format. The requirements seem to be: (a) efficient serialization/deserialization, and (b) can easily convert to a SAMRecord for compatibility with existing code. We can make things extra efficient by only deserializing things if they are needed (if a phase doesn't need the CIGAR-related structures, no need to deserialize that). We can achieve this by having the deserialization be lazy. The LazyBAMRecord is a step in that direction since it looks up the reference name only if we ask for it, but we could go a lot further in this direction. But before we do that, having an efficient coder for SAMRecords (I vote for @tomwhite's approach of using the BAMEncoder) will get us 80% of the way for 20% of the effort. Then we can introduce our OptimizedSAMRecord incrementally. . on **headers**:. I agree with @tomwhite that adding the header back after a shuffle is the right thing to do. We know where that happens and we control that code.; @davidadamsphd, you worry about newcomers. But we've already decided that we were going to provide our own API for them (one that does the Dataflow copying for them so they don't have to worry about it). This same API will provide them with header-filled reads, so they don't have to worry about this detail. This falls into the general category of ""the 3rd party devs won't have to even know about Dataflow/Spark: they just need to know our nice, simple interface and use that"". If they know more and want to do fancier things then more power to them, but those users will surely be able to fill in headers, too. We have library functions to use the reads without the headers, but the problem is that (at least for the sort of code I'm writing), I'm handing off a SAMRecord to a big black box and I can't force it to use the library functions - it's going to work on the SAMRecord directly. So at least in this case it's important to fill in the header ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451:146,efficient,efficient,146,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451,3,['efficient'],['efficient']

I've also tried running the BQSRPipelineSpark to see if that would suffer the same issue and it fails in the same manner. Additionally, I've run ValidateSamFile. There are some reads missing their mates, but this hasn't presented an issue in other tools (including vanilla BaseRecalibrator).

Energy Efficiency,"plotypes in the sample contains the site-specific alternate allele at the site (ie. excluding `*` which represents variation that beings upstream of the current variant. NB that this results in cases where `PGT` is not the same as the phased `GT` field. For example, in the case of a spanned SNP site with REF allele `A` and alt alleles `C` and `*`, `GT` may be set to `1|2` to represent the spanned SNP, while PGT would be set to `1|0` to represent the fact that it is the first haplotype in the pair of phased haplotypes that contains the site-specific alt allele (in this case `C`). If reviewers agree with this interpretation, I think we should create a new ticket to clarify documentation around the PGT and PID tags to reflect it. . After discussions with @ldgauthier I believe that there may be downstream issues in preserving phasing after passing gVCFs through CombineGVCFs, GenomicsDBImport, and/or GenotypeGVCFs, especially if the gVCFs are emitted without GT fields. In that case, `GenotypeGVCFs` should probably have logic to reconstruct the phased genotype for each sample based on the PGT and PID tags when possible. I will create a new ticket describing the issue. There still may be cases where HaplotypeCaller does not emit phasing information for spanning deletions due to the presence of extra haplotypes that contradict diploid phasing, as in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845. A fix to that issue would likely reduce the number of those cases. The integration test result file `src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/GenotypeGVCFs/withOxoGReadCounts.vcf` does not have any changes that have to do with this PR -- it was automatically updated by GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest, which included some new jitter in QUAL scores as described in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6859, but never got checked in with that PR. I figure that it's best to update it now so that the results reflect the current expected behavior of the tool.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6937:1818,reduce,reduce,1818,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6937,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Working on it on GATK3 but I could merge it into GATK4 whenever is ready if you prefer. ---. @vdauwera commented on [Mon Nov 14 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1425#issuecomment-260509332). Ok great, totally fine to do in 3 but please do port to 4 when it's ready. Do you have an order of magnitude sense of when it might be ready? Meaning days/weeks/months (for release scheduling purposes). ---. @vruano commented on [Fri Mar 10 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1425#issuecomment-285721454). In the last methods meeting I presented the results of our first effort to improve accuracy calling in STR. As far as unfiltered single and trio calls are concerned the recommendation is to apply the new model with PCR+ data. However, for PCR- dataset one either can choose not apply any correction or to apply the new model train on PCR- data... the latter seems to have slightly F1 values however for the sake of simplicity it might just make sense no to apply any correct; either way is good. The presentation I gave can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzt9p0vCNxlHWlZVUHZfdXR5MTg). ---. @vruano commented on [Fri Mar 10 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1425#issuecomment-285722791). It seems that at some point Planatir will take a look and see whether it improves calls once filtered with VQSR. ---. @vdauwera commented on [Mon Mar 20 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1425#issuecomment-287822174). Is there a PR associated with this issue? Will there be a new feature to release?

Energy Efficiency,"roadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-174245406). @chandrans My other bug turned into a very long undertaking, but seems to be nearing completion. It might even be done already, pending Laura's confirmation that the output vcfs are what we want. Then I will move on to this one. ---. @chandrans commented on [Tue Jan 26 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-175192516). Ah wonderful. Thanks David. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Tue Apr 12 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-209080316). As discussed in support meeting today, this issue is high-effort, low-reward for now but will be much easier to revisit (if it's even necessary at all) once the exact AF calculation is replaced with something less baroque. ---. @vruano commented on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217265362). It seems to me that a quick and sound solution is to reduce the number of alternative alleles at this point in HCGenotypeEngine code:. ```; HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine.java line 260:; final Map<Allele, List<Haplotype>> alleleMapper = createAlleleMapper(mergeMap, eventMapper);; ```. Haplotypes have associated score, as a pseudo-likelihood,that can be use to sort then and selectively remove those alternative alleles that are only supported by the less likely haplotypes. ---. @vruano commented on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217266027). So the idea is simple, keep removing haplotypes from that map value lists one by one until enough allele's are emptied, so that the number of genotypes does not surpasses a maximum based on the largest ploidy amongst the input samples. Of course, one would need to create some temporary data-structure to make the operation more efficient. . ---. @vruano commented on [Thu May 05 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-217267",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2955:5416,reduce,reduce,5416,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2955,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"rs specific to PGEN extract. ### Large scale testing; All of my testing (with the exception of some very small scale stuff early on) has been done in the [GVS_AoU_PGEN_Extract_Development Terra workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/allofus-drc-prod-auxiliary/GVS_AoU_PGEN_Extract_Development) and using data from the GVS Delta callset (aou-genomics-curation-prod.aou_wgs_fullref_v2). My test process (for the majority of tests) has been as follows:. 1. Select a list of sample names from aou_wgs_fullref_v2.sample_info (excluding control samples and sample 3224672 because of the data issue mentioned [here](https://broadinstitute.slack.com/archives/CJRLP6ZSA/p1699026273329339)).; 2. Use that list as an input to GvsPrepareRangesCallset to create a cohort of test data in a separate BigQuery dataset (aou-genomics-curation-prod.klydon_pgen_extract_test).; 3. Run GvsExtractCallsetPgen on the newly created cohort. (I would just run GvsExtractCallsetPgenMerged, but I like using Workflow Dashboard to monitor how the job is going and dig into it if there are any failures. Workflow Dashboard doesn't seem to let you dig into individual tasks for workflows with sub-workflows, so it wouldn't allow me to look at individual shards running ExtractTask if I ran GvsExtractCallsetPgenMerged. Job Manager would be an alternative for this, but it seems to be pretty much unusable for even moderately-sized jobs.); 4. Run GvsExtractCallset on the newly created cohort, making sure to use the same parameters, including scatter count. This will generate VCF files that we can use to compare to the PGEN files created during the previous step for validation.; 5. Run GvsExtractCallsetPgenMerged with the same parameters used to run GvsExtractCallsetPgen in Step 3. This will use call-caching for the extract steps and then merge the PGEN files by chromosome.

We then fit the per-contig coverage histograms across all samples with the appropriate negative-binomial distributions corresponding to a sparse mixture of genotypes, while accounting for 1) sample-specific depth (which determines the means of the negative-binomial distributions), 2) multiplicative contig-specific bias (which is mild, at least for WGS), and 3) additive sample-contig-specific mosaicism or bias (note that the above genotype priors imply that mosaicism/bias on top of a baseline of CN = 2 is the only deviation allowed for the autosomes, which is somewhat restrictive but greatly aids convergence). I put together a pure PyMC3 prototype that seems to work relatively well. Here are the per-contig coverage histograms (unfiltered bins in blue, bins retained after filtering in red, and negative-binomial fit in green) and a heatmap of per-contig ploidy probabilities. Both the panel (first 20) and case (remaining) samples are shown:. ![prototype-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37938642-e9fbd804-312c-11e8-8a6c-02ea4e4fa704.png). Although the prototype model is clearly a good fit to the filtered data, some care in choosing the optimizer and its learning parameters is required to achieve convergence to the correct solution. This is because the problem is inherently multimodal and thus there are many local minima. I found that using AdaMax with a naive strategy of warm restarts (to help kick us out of local minima) worked decently; we can achieve convergence in <10 minutes for 60 samples x 24 contigs x 250 count bins:. ![elbo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37938658-fc176f12-312c-11e8-89e2-40c68e0f9953.png).

This might or might not affect us since it looks like travis is pulling from our GCR repo for builds but we should be mindful of workflows that might rely on pulling hundreds of docker images from docker-hub through anonymous web VMs:; ```; On Monday, November 2, 2020 at 9am Pacific Standard Time, Docker will begin enforcing rate limits on container pulls for Anonymous and Free users. Anonymous (unauthenticated) users will be limited to 100 container image pulls every six hours, and Free (authenticated) users will be limited to 200 container image pulls every six hours, when enforcement is fully implemented. Docker Pro and Team subscribers can pull container images from Docker Hub without restriction, as long as the quantities are not excessive or abusive.; In addition, we are pausing enforcement of the changes to our image-retention policies until mid-2021, when we anticipate incorporating them into usage-based pricing. Two months ago, we announced an update to Docker image-retention policies. As originally stated, this change, which was set to take effect on November 1, 2020, would result in the deletion of images for free Docker account users after six months of inactivity. Today's announcement means Docker will not enforce image expiration on November 1, 2020.; ```; This is farther clarified on their FAQ https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates:; ```; Rate limits for Docker image pulls are based on the account type of the user requesting the image - not the account type of the image’s owner. These are defined on the pricing page.; The highest entitlement a user has, based on their personal account and any orgs they belong to, will be used. Unauthenticated pull requests are “anonymous” and will be rate limited based on IP address rather than user ID.

In the last methods meeting I presented the results of our first effort to improve accuracy calling in STR. As far as unfiltered single and trio calls are concerned the recommendation is to apply the new model with PCR+ data. However, for PCR- dataset one either can choose not apply any correction or to apply the new model train on PCR- data... the latter seems to have slightly F1 values however for the sake of simplicity it might just make sense no to apply any correct; either way is good.

Energy Efficiency,"specs/SAMv1.pdf, pg 5, item 5). It is defined in the range [0, 2^8-1]. The specific value 255 is reserved for when MAPQ is not available. Most MAPQs are well below 255. We consider the following process for assigning reads to each target. Pick a read ""k"" aligned to target ""t"" with a given MAPQ_k. By definition, it maps to the genomic position ""x"" with p_x = 1 - 10^{-MAPQ_k/10}, and to some other position with probability 1 - p_x. We refer to the alignment genomic position of read k as x_k, and the exome target(s) it overlaps with T_k. Let's assume we have T exome targets, and let z_{kt} be a 1-of-#T indicator variable for a read where t is a target and #T is the number of all exome targets. \pi_{kq} = P(z_{kq} = 1) =. p_k x O_{kq} if q \in T_k; (1 - p_k) / (#T - #T_k) if q \notin T_k. Here, O_{kq} is the fractional overlap of the read to an exome target q. Note that since we don't have the information about the next best alignment position, we take a flat prior. Finally, the number of reads belonging to target t, n_t, reads as:. n_t = \sum_k z_{kt}. Since there are many reads, n_t will be approximately Gaussian. It is an elementary calculation to calculate coverage mean E[n_t] and coverage variance var[n_t] in terms of \pi_{kq}. In the probabilistic target coverage model, var[n_t] will be added to the statistical noise. So, the read count collection will have two entries for each target: coverage mean, and coverage variance. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Wed Oct 19 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/748#issuecomment-254812286). @samuelklee @asmirnov239 ; The outcome of https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/746 will indicate whether or not we'll need this. Andrey already has a preliminary indication that a fair fraction (50%!) of reads have mapping quality < 20. This implies a very significant coverage variance.

Energy Efficiency,"st and there's no batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things. We've considered a java only image for a while which would be much smaller than the current one. (although still fat by most docker standards...). We've never released one publicly because it seemed like it might cause confusion, but it's a reasonable possibility. . If you have any secret methods to reduce the size of python or R installations we're ha",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427:1239,reduce,reduce,1239,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"t can go faster when given more RAM: going from; the earlier experimental envelope of 192GB of RAM to 256GB instead, the; bcast version can go from 19 min to 10min (sharded takes 7min with the; small amount of memory). This is consistent with my earlier experiments; that also showed that increasing the RAM-per-core sped up the bcast; computation. I wouldn't worry about having found a configuration where sharded performs; poorly. My experiments so far have shown that there are lots of; configuration points where one or the other performs poorly; the onus is on; finding the good configuration values that result in better performance, or; identifying which algorithms may be performant for a larger range of; parameter choices. To maximize understanding I would suggest that we not change too many; parameters at a time. For example it seems unnecessary to have multiple; variants of the 128Mbp input. I found there can be significant (>50%) variation between identical runs.; One way to reduce this is to set spark.task.maxFailures=1 which I strongly; recommend for all experiments going forward. One concern I have is that our cluster memory is already far larger than; the input size. In fact here each machine can fit the whole input; comfortably in RAM. This is not going to be the case for the full input.; Since it would take too long to iterate using the full input, it seems wise; instead to reduce both the input size and to keep a close eye on the amount; of memory we're using to make sure we're not going down a path that would; not be able to cope with the full input.

Note the following about the above I/O:. - The position (the 2nd number) is *NOT* changing, so each write seeks to a position and overwrites that block; - As a result the previous 34 writes are thrown away and are useless, only the 35th write makes it to the resulting file.; - Even the last IO of 4256 bytes, only moves the position up by 4096 bytes.; - This problem turns a relatively I/O friendly sequential workload turns into a bunch of tiny writes with seeks for each one. *TERRIBLE* for spinning disks. The solution I propose is just to have two 64KB buffers and only write 64KB when the first buffer is full with the overflow going into the second buffer.

Energy Efficiency,"ts header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and complexity of the header tag might also depend on the ; execution environment. If the execution environment only supports a ; small finite number of headers, the header tag could be a small integer, ; or in a different execution environment it could be; a unique hash of the header or something like that. Memory footprint in ; the receiver is minimized because many SAMRecords can all share the same ; header object.; This requires more work to support in each execution environment, but it ; seems like it could be efficient and allows application code written to ; operate on SAMRecords to be portable; across different execution environments without having to contend with ; the possible presence of headerless SAMRecords. -Bob.

In this instance the variant in question is listed in the rej.vcf file obtained via `--debug-assembly-variants-out`. I have examined `bamout.bam` as well as the input bam and there appears to be ample coverage at the site of interest (the T at position 8316 is the position of interest, highlighted):. ![](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/user_images/aGbHKebG7Tb8Lgu33gGzXw.png). I have tried running this with some of the additional parameters in \[[https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043491652-When-HaplotypeCaller-and-Mutect2-do-not-call-an-expected-variant\](/hc/en-us/articles/360043491652-When-HaplotypeCaller-and-Mutect2-do-not-call-an-expected-variant)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043491652-When-HaplotypeCaller-and-Mutect2-do-not-call-an-expected-variant](/hc/en-us/articles/360043491652-When-HaplotypeCaller-and-Mutect2-do-not-call-an-expected-variant)) (namely `--linked-de-bruijn-graph` and `--recover-all-dangling-branches`) to no avail. Coverage is very deep at this position (>2000x). Notably if I edit the input to `--alleles` and change the allele of interest (8316:T>A) to anything else (8316:T>C or T>G) it appropriately shows up in the output VCF. What am I missing here? Let me know if you have any solutions or if you need any additional files. UPDATE: Adding `--disable-adaptive-pruning` now produces the variant of interest specified in --alleles, but also adds several other new calls, in case that is helpful in isolating where this force-call variant is being lost.<br><br><i>(created from <a href='https://broadinstitute.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/270138'>Zendesk ticket #270138</a>)<br> gz#270138</i>",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7672:2858,adapt,adaptive-pruning,2858,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7672,1,['adapt'],['adaptive-pruning']

Energy Efficiency,"…al memory (as opposed to resident memory) under control. This solves (I think) a long-time problem for anyone using the GATK under SGE or any other scheduler that imposes hard limits on _virual_ memory. The posting at this link describes in detail what is going on:. https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/kevgrig/entry/linux_glibc_2_10_rhel_6_malloc_may_show_excessive_virtual_memory_usage?. TL;DR: there was a change in `malloc` in `glibc` several years ago that attempts to make memory allocation more efficient in multi-threaded apps on multi-core machines, by creating many memory pools (arenas) from which allocation requests are satisfied. On systems with lots of CPUs it can cause virtual memory usage to balloon up to many times the heap size (e.g. we see 30GB VIRT with -Xmx4G and < 4G resident). In some very limited testing I didn't see any significant performance change from limiting the number of arenas. My suspicion is that since Java is allocating fairly large blocks of memory using `malloc` and then allocating internal to the JVM this shouldn't have much if any affect on Java programs.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5849:149,schedul,scheduler,149,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5849,2,"['efficient', 'schedul']","['efficient', 'scheduler']"

Integrability," 3 parts:; 1. The PGEN-JNI, a C++/JNI library that handles writing HTSJDK VariantContext objects to PGEN files,; 2. ExtractCohortToPgen, a GATK tool based on ExtractCohortToVcf that processes VariantContexts and passes them to PGEN-JNI for writing, and; 3. GvsExtractCallsetPgenMerged, a WDL workflow based on GvsExtractCallset that uses ExtractCohortToPgen to write a series of PGEN files and then merges them by chromosome. ### Part 1: PGEN-JNI; The PGEN-JNI library was written by Chris Norman of the GATK Engine Team and lives [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pgen-jni). It is written primarily in C++ for performance purposes and also compatibility with the pgenlib library (part of the [plink repo](https://github.com/chrchang/plink-ng/tree/master)). It builds on top of pgenlib to provide a writer for creating PGEN files and writing to them from HTSJDK VariantContext objects. PGEN-JNI is compatible with Linux and macOS. A build of this library is currently hosted on the Broad's artifactory repo, and that is being used as a dependency for GATK. Ownership of the PGEN-JNI library will stay with the GATK Engine Team and we will provide support for it if y'all encounter any issues with it. ### Part 2: ExtractCohortToPgen; ExtractCohortToPgen is a GATK tool that inherits from ExtractCohort and is based very closely on ExtractCohortToVcf. It produces 3-4 files:. 1. A `.pgen` file, which contains a mapping of samples and sites to variants,; 2. A `.psam` file, which contains a list of sample names,; 3. A `.pvar.zst` file, which is a zstd compressed list of sites with alleles, similar to a sites-only VCF, and; 4. Optionally (if specified by setting `write-mode` to `WRITE_SEPARATE_INDEX`), a `.pgi` file, which contains an index for the `.pgen` file. It has a few arguments that are specific to it that warrant explanation. #### pgen-chromosome-code; Plink defines a set of [chromosome codes](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/data#irreg_output) that correspond to differen",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8708:2664,depend,dependency,2664,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8708,1,['depend'],['dependency']

General questions about how to use the GATK, how to interpret the output, etc. should be asked on the [official support forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk).; - Search the existing github issues to see if your issue (or something similar) has already been reported. If the issue already exists, you may comment there to inquire about the progress.; - Determine whether your issue is a **bug report**, a **feature request**, or a **documentation request** (for tool/class javadoc only -- for forum docs please post there); - Consider if your ""issue"" is better addressed on the GATK forum: http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk Post there if you have questions about expected tool behavior, output format, unexpected results, or generally any question that does not fit into the categories above; - Use a **concise** yet **descriptive** title; - Choose the corresponding template block below and fill it in, replacing or deleting text in italics (surrounded by `_`) as appropriate; - Delete the other template blocks and this header. ----. ## Feature request. ### Tool(s) or class(es) involved. VariantRecalibrator. ### Description. VariantRecalibrator automatically runs the generated Rscript to produce recalibration plots. This is usually good and convenient, but it requires that all *R* dependencies must be installed in the same environment in the current running GATK environment. This is not necessarily the case for sandbox-based package managers e.g. docker or conda. A viable fix on the user's side is to include R dependencies with GATK in e.g. docker or conda. But I think I would prefer if my packages were as independent of each other as possible. It would be great if **VariantRecalibrator had an option to write but not run the Rscript for recalibration plots.** Then, the user can call the Rscript in an appropriate e.g. R conda environment or docker image.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7697:1420,depend,dependencies,1420,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7697,2,['depend'],['dependencies']

To fix it, I tried by excluding `com.intel.gkl` from GATK and add it as a dependency to my program, but it blows up anyway. In addition, I tried a sample program to load the PairHMM fastest implementation by `PairHMM.Implementation.FASTEST_AVAILABLE.makeNewHMM()`, and it also blows up. If I remove completely the dependency in my shadow jar, the command line blows up because the gkl `IntelDeflaterFactory` is not found. I guess that the error in the library is GKL-related, but in the case of the GATK framework I would like to have a way of using the library without assuming that the final user will have support for the native code or not. Could this be done? I prefer not to remove the faster code by intel because I know that some users will benefit from it.

Integrability," a better format. The requirements seem to be: (a) efficient serialization/deserialization, and (b) can easily convert to a SAMRecord for compatibility with existing code. We can make things extra efficient by only deserializing things if they are needed (if a phase doesn't need the CIGAR-related structures, no need to deserialize that). We can achieve this by having the deserialization be lazy. The LazyBAMRecord is a step in that direction since it looks up the reference name only if we ask for it, but we could go a lot further in this direction. But before we do that, having an efficient coder for SAMRecords (I vote for @tomwhite's approach of using the BAMEncoder) will get us 80% of the way for 20% of the effort. Then we can introduce our OptimizedSAMRecord incrementally. . on **headers**:. I agree with @tomwhite that adding the header back after a shuffle is the right thing to do. We know where that happens and we control that code.; @davidadamsphd, you worry about newcomers. But we've already decided that we were going to provide our own API for them (one that does the Dataflow copying for them so they don't have to worry about it). This same API will provide them with header-filled reads, so they don't have to worry about this detail. This falls into the general category of ""the 3rd party devs won't have to even know about Dataflow/Spark: they just need to know our nice, simple interface and use that"". If they know more and want to do fancier things then more power to them, but those users will surely be able to fill in headers, too. We have library functions to use the reads without the headers, but the problem is that (at least for the sort of code I'm writing), I'm handing off a SAMRecord to a big black box and I can't force it to use the library functions - it's going to work on the SAMRecord directly. So at least in this case it's important to fill in the header (unless I happen to know that the ""black box"" won't call any of the header-requiring methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451:1502,interface,interface,1502,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability," and capturing/resolving these BND's that are not suitable for _THIS PARTICULAR_ logic. I guess in general my personal preference is to put less algorithm-related information in VCF for analysts (less reading for them), and produce add on files for tool developers. What's your thoughts?. > Does this even have to be a spark tool? It looks like you are just reading the variants into a parallel spark context, filtering, and then collecting them to actually process them. Why not just make this a non-spark tool and process it all in memory on one node?. Answer: Agree. It doesn't have to be, at least in theory, and it probably is going to be faster as we don't need to incur the Spark overhead for such a typically small job. But (I'm saying too many buts....) up to this point all SV tools are under the package `hellbender.tools.spark.sv`, so I'm following suit here. Note the two classes's main interface methods mentions nothing about RDDs (that's on purpose). ; On the other hand, this is an engineering question I believe, and it depends on whether we want to put as much of discovery code as possible into `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` (the last commit actually hooks the two classes into it, so a single invocation of the tool produces more variants), or we go wdl in pipelining the whole process. -------. All in all, I think the comments and critics are generally about the ""filtering""/""classifying"" part, and the most serious concern about it is false negatives. Am I understanding correctly? If so, given that the filtering step is only picking the BND's that are suitable to the linking logic, I can imagine the false negative problem be solved in the future by other logics (e.g. more relaxed requirement on pair matching, or not even requiring matching INV55/INV33 pairs, etc.) In fact, that's what I'm planning on.; Another part of the problem is how much I can accomplish in this single PR, and how large it should be&mdash;the forever existing problem for new tools.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929:6278,depend,depends,6278,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929,1,['depend'],['depends']

For example, if you wish to read (""chr2"", [ 50, 50M] ), then only the second array is queried.; - In the previous version of the tool, the array name was a constant - _genomicsdb_array_. The new version will be backward compatible with respect to reads. Hence, if a directory named _genomicsdb_array_ is found in the workspace directory, it's passed as the array for the _GenomicsDBFeatureReader_ otherwise the array names are generated from the directory entry names.; - Parallel import based on chromosome intervals.

Integrability," as a line. This is similar but not analogous to the current behavior for the existing gene lists where we take pains to exclude from the overlap counts bases that are intronic bases in the gene list. . Unfortunately, since the GFF3 format is hierarchical and supports a very large number of feature types it will be very difficult to extract the intron/exon boundaries without properly parsing the GFF3 format. The GFF3 format supports .obo files that lay out the feature hierarchy and through parsing of that format it would be possible to extract intron/exon boundaries but that is not currently supported by HTSJDK and would involve us merging https://github.com/kachulis/htsjdk/tree/ck_gff3_feature_evaluator first in order to support and then on top of that coming up with some rules for deciding what units exactly make up a gene that should be merged for coverage counting. . I see a few options going forwards:; - We could support GFF3 gene lists with hard coded genes/CDS features to be included. This is brittle given that there are a number of more specific names for CDS (coding sequence) exons in genes that might end up being excluded.; - We could support GFF3 format but ignore exon sequences which would mean that the behavior for counting the same genes will vary depending on which format the gene is provided.; - We could support GFF3 gene lists but allow the user to specify exactly what feature types they want to include. This would probably be the best stop-gap solution but we would have to think hard about how to have the user specify ""I want to count genes (with these possible sub-names for what a gene is) and here is a list of CDS elements that could possibly constitute gene exons."" seems complicated to implement correctly but it has the added advantage of probably allowing the user to do much more interesting/fancy analyses with DoC.; - We could wait for the .obo file to be implemented and attempt to parse intron/exon boundaries by reading the ontology provided.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413:1905,depend,depending,1905,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability," batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things. We've considered a java only image for a while which would be much smaller than the current one. (although still fat by most docker standards...). We've never released one publicly because it seemed like it might cause confusion, but it's a reasonable possibility. . If you have any secret methods to reduce the size of python or R installations we're happy to take PRs!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427:1752,depend,dependencies,1752,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

It would be very nice if genomicDBimport allowed addition of new data to existing database, and/or genotypegVCF allowed multiple gVCFs."". ----; User Report; ----. This is the error message I am getting but it doesn't make much sense, given that I got it also on smaller datasets with large amounts of memory (larger than some of the specifications listed on this forum for genomicDBimport). Our IT people, after observing the job, seem to think this is a java-related bug as the process itself doesn't use anywhere near the memory specified. We have installed a new version of java and I will be re-running the analysis to see if this solved the issues. . I'm not sure if I should be creating a new thread for this, but I do have a general comment about genomicDBimport. The project I am involved with is in partnership with an industrial partner, who sequences a number of animals every few weeks. In the pipeline using GATK 3.6, the newly sequenced animals were combined using combinegVCF and multiple gVCFs were then fed into genotypeGVCFs. . Unless I am missing something, the current set up in GATK 4.0 is not ideal for routine sequencing. First, I need to combine all animals every time a new batch of data is added (rather than adding a batch to existing database). Second, if I decide to use combineGVCFs in GATK 4.0, I have to run it twice, first to combine the new cohort, then to combine the new cohort with older animals so that I have 1 file to feed to genotypegVCF. . As such I am now reverting back to GATK 3.6. It would be very nice if genomicDBimport allowed addition of new data to existing database, and/or genotypegVCF allowed multiple gVCFs.

Integrability," might be a hundred or so reads; and each cell is only contributing one to three reads. For other; mutations, maybe there's less than 10 reads corresponding to less than 10; cells, and it can vary pretty dramatically. The total number of cells; represented in a single sample can be thousands to tens of thousands,; usually - but could be many more as the tech advances. My hack for it at the moment is to encode both the cell barcode and the UMI; information into the read name. Then, for each variant, I query the reads; that overlap that variant in the bam file and analyze each read for; supporting the variant or the REF allele - then I can count the reads; according to the specific cells and also deal with any UMI redundancy per; cell. This works pretty well except for the cases where the HC reassembly; provides evidence for the variant and I can't track it to the originally; aligned reads. Also, mostly I think the difficulty here relates to indels; around homopolymers with our pacbio long isoform reads in our rna-seq; variant pipeline that leverages the gatk rna-seq protocol with HC.

Integrability," need to anticipate this; and existing code may need to be updated. In other words, headerless ; SAMRecords should become ""part of the spec"". Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and complexity of the header tag might also depend on the ; execution environment. If the execution environment only supports a ; small finite number of headers, the header tag could be a small integer, ; or in a different execution environment it could be; a unique hash of the header or something like that. Memory footprint in ; the receiver is minimized because many SAMRecords can all share the same ; header object.; This requires more work to support in each execution environment, but it ; seems like it could be efficient and allows application code written to ; operate on SAMRecords to be portable; across different execution environments without having to contend with ; the possible presence of headerless SAMRecords. -Bob.

Integrability," the count likelihood is actually misspecified there. As an example, consider trying to fit a Poisson to data that is actually zero-inflated Poisson---fitting the histogram will actually result in a more robust estimate for the mean. Another benefit is that truncated data (as we have here) is straightforwardly handled in an unbiased way. In the special case of complete, trivially-binned data, the full, unbinned likelihood is recovered. I think this sort of histogram fitting is pretty standard in the astro/particle community. We can certainly change up the model to include strictly quantized + free-floating states as you describe (rather than the ""fuzzily quantized"" states I use here), but I just wanted to avoid having another level of mixtures/logsumexps for this quick prototype. However, note that modeling mosaicism on the autosomes is desirable, but there we also want the strong diploid prior to nail down the depth and per-contig bias. So we will have to be a little careful about how we introduce free-floating states. Also, since I was not using gcnvkernel, I had to integrate out all discrete parameters. It may be that we can write down a nice model with discrete parameters if we use your inference framework. Finally, I did not further bin the counts here (or rather, the bin size is 1), which already yields the maximum information, but I did use a maximum-count cutoff. If we use the same cutoff for all samples, this allows us to simply pass a non-ragged matrix from Java (with dimensions of samples x contigs x maximum count) as a TSV. However, we may run into trouble if we hit a case sample with very high depth. So some sort of sparse representation of the histogram might indeed be desirable, but I think it should be an exact representation of the full histogram. This would require us to sync up code to emit and consume the representation in both Java and python, so I'd like to avoid it if possible---I think I'd prefer just emitting the ragged matrix, in that case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376307522:1529,integrat,integrate,1529,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376307522,1,['integrat'],['integrate']
Integrability," the inconsistency was introduced in the GermlineCNVCaller step. It’s possible that you could edit the files manually so that you don’t have to rerun all GermlineCNVCaller shards; for example, you could check that all dictionaries in the output of the good shards (i.e., those that contain intervals that are correctly ordered with respect to either dictionary) are the correct dictionary used to generate the count files, reshard/reorder the intervals in the failing shards and rerun GermlineCNVCaller, then stitch everything back together with PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. However, I think this will be a rather delicate surgery and it may be easy to mess up. I would just recommend fresh runs of GermlineCNVCaller with the correct dictionary and an appropriately ordered interval list. I would go so far as to recommend you delete and/or never use that dictionary again—such incorrectly ordered dictionaries are a frequent source of heartbreak!. I would say that the code is working as intended and that the error message is sufficiently informative. However, we could certainly fail earlier, before the expensive GermlineCNVCaller step. As mentioned above, we will need to do some work to enable this; I would suggest:. 1) we enable passing of dictionaries from `-L` Picard interval lists at the engine level (and I would add consistency checks if multiple interval lists are provided here as well),; 2) we add checks to all relevant gCNV tools of read-count dictionaries against the intervals dictionary,; 3) we change the behavior of `CopyNumberArgumentValidationUtils.resolveIntervals` so that it fails if provided an unsorted IAC, rather than sorting the contained intervals w.r.t. the count dictionary upon creation of the returned `SimpleIntervalCollection` (this can be done independently of the first two items and would have caused the failing shard to fail earlier; however, the other two items are required to cause all shards to fail earlier),; 4) we revert the change made to Postproc",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-719576249:1093,message,message,1093,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-719576249,1,['message'],['message']

Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context. Let us know if this is an option you'd like to explore; we'd be happy to help. —; You are receiving this because you were mentioned.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349:1221,integrat,integrate,1221,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349,3,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integrating', 'integration']"

Integrability," unnecessary copies of the data (now fixed: https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow/pull/60), which caused OOM errors when trying to broadcast the 3GB reference data. With this fixed, I ran a [pipeline called JoinReferencesDataflow](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/dataflow/pipelines/JoinReferencesDataflow.java) on a small cluster that broadcasts the reference as a dataflow view. The code is a modified version of CountReadsDataflow that simply sends the view, and then doesn't use it, so we can see the cost of doing a broadcast (See the rest of the code in this branch: https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/tree/hadoop-references). JoinReferencesDataflow took 2 min 25s to run, of which 18s were for reading the reference from the local filesystem in the driver. For comparison, CountReadsDataflow took 17s on the same cluster. So broadcasting the reference takes less than 2 minutes. Note that this was just for one task, but Spark has [an efficient protocol for sending broadcast variables](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~agearh/cs267.sp10/files/mosharaf-spark-bc-report-spring10.pdf), which scales well with the number of nodes, so the approach looks feasible. Having said all that, we might still want to use the sharding approach, in order to share more code between the Google and Spark dataflow implementations. One way this could work would be to generalize `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata` to support reading reference data from a [ReferenceHadoopSource](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/dataflow/datasources/ReferenceHadoopSource.java), which is in line with @droazen's last comment. Am I right in thinking that the read pipeline work is being completed in https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/tree/da_read_pipeline?

Integrability,"# Summary. This PR adds a new flag to `HaplotypeCaller` called `--ploidy-regions` which allows the user to input a .bed or .interval_list with ""name"" column equal to a positive integer for the ploidy to use when calling variants in that region. The main use case is for calling haploid variants outside the PAR for XY individuals as required by the VCF spec, but this provides a much more flexible interface for other similar niche applications, like genotyping individuals with other known aneuploidies. The global `-ploidy` flag will still provide the background default (or the built-in ploidy of 2 for humans), but the user input value will supersede these in overlapping regions. Note that the overlap is checked against the active region, meaning variants near the boundary of the `--ploidy-regions` file may end up with GT fields having ploidy slightly differently than expected, for example if your custom region overlaps a given active region but the variant ends up being written to a location outside that interval. In this case the ploidy from the user input would be used rather than any other default. # Implementation Details. The key idea is to allow `HaplotypeCallerEngine` to initialize multiple genotyping engines based on the `--ploidy-regions` input. The intervals are first parsed to check for positive integer ploidy values, and then used to create hashmaps of ploidy -> genotyper. The engine uses two types of genotypers: one for active region determination and one for doing the actual genotyping. Both admit a ploidy paramter passed via `hcArgs`. This PR modifies the `HaplotypeCallerArgumentCollection` class to include a method for creating copies of this object with differing ploidy amounts. These then get fed to the constructors of the appropriate genotyper classes, which are organized into two hashmaps. In every situation where one of these genotypers is used, we instead begin the scope by calling a ""get local genotyper"" method that performs the logic of checking ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8464:398,interface,interface,398,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8464,1,['interface'],['interface']

If there are overlapping reference blocks when running ValidateVariants with the `-no-overlaps` option, a USER ERROR is outputted after the entire tool finishes running, as shown below:. ```; ***********************************************************************. A USER ERROR has occurred: This GVCF contained overlapping reference blocks. The first overlapping interval is [genomic coordinates here]. ***********************************************************************; ```. This error should be generally helpful, but it appears that the interval that is reported in the error message is the _last_ overlapping interval, not the _first_. I'm not super familiar with java, but I'm guessing that `firstOverlap` might be continuously replaced by `refInterval` if there are multiple overlaps, which is inconsistent with expected behavior. .

Integrability,"## Bug Report. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); GenotypeGVCFs with `-all-sites`. ### Affected version(s); - 4.2 through 4.6. ### Description ; We tried to run GenotypeGVCFs from GATK 4.5 with `-all-sites` on a dataset with 120 samples and GRCh37 as the reference. Each run was limited to a single chromosome. All of them failed after consuming 3 TB of memory. Subsequently, I tried a smaller subset of 8 samples limiting the memory to 32 GB and all the runs failed after 3-10 Mbp depending on the chromosome. Finally, I randomly picked chromosome 9 and used GATK versions from 4.1 to 4.6 and only 4.1 did not experience the problem. It finished the whole chromosome (141 Mbp) with the max memory usage of around 8 GB. All others failed after 3-6 Mbp (Sorry, I used different memory settings for 4.5, so I did not include it.). ![memory_usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df354842-d420-4a99-b3d3-01fec64d18fd). Time is in seconds, memory is in MB. If I run the same command without `-all-sites`, the maximum memory usage is around 1.6 GB. #### Steps to reproduce. GenomicDB was created using the corresponding GATK version as:. ```; gatk --java-options ""-Xmx12000m"" GenomicsDBImport --genomicsdb-workspace-path tmp/genomicsdb44/9 \; --genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations --batch-size 120 --verbosity DEBUG \; -L 9 -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/1.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/2.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/3.g.vcf.gz \; -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/4.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/5.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/6.g.vcf.gz \; -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/7.g.vcf.gz -V data/gatk/gvcf/9/8.g.vcf.gz; ```.

Integrability,"## Bug Report. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); `Funcotator`. ### Affected version(s); GATK 4.1.0.0 release. ### Description . Functotator MAF output does not properly show genotypes from somatic multi-tumor VCF files produced using M2. It looks like only genotypes from the first tumor sample are shown, but there are no errors or messages to point the user to this fact. Only a single `tumor_sample` and `normal_sample` are reported in the MAF header:. ```; ##normal_sample=xxx; ##source=FilterMutectCalls; ##source=Funcotator; ##source=Mutect2; ##tumor_sample=xxx; ```. Conversely, instructing `Funcotator` to output VCF format properly adds the annotation to the INFO field while retaining the FORMAT-level genotypes works well. However, in this case the VCF header also only lists a single tumor_sample (take note: this is a separate bug, though mostly aesthetics) despite all tumor genotypes being included. #### Steps to reproduce; Run Funcotator with output format set to MAF on any multi-tumor VCF file. #### Expected behavior; Either one of:; 1. `Funcotator` should return an error when trying to process multi-tumor VCF to MAF output; 2. `Funcotator` MAF should output multiple lines per funcotation for each tumor sample, indicating the comparison in the `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` and `Normal_Sample_Barcode` columns.; 3. `Funcotator` should not output genotype information when processing multi-tumor VCF to MAF (this could also be an additional Funcotator parameter that must be switched on when requesting MAF output). #### Actual behavior; Funcotator runs without errors or warnings and the output file is missing genotypes for the other tumor samples",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5687:334,message,messages,334,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5687,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"## Bug Report. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); particularly _SelectVariants_, but really anything that writes out a vcf. ### Affected version(s); - [ ] Latest public release version [version?]; - [x] Latest master branch as of [2/6/2020]. ### Description ; There are minimal/inconsistent checks that variants added to vcfWriters are correctly ordered (an issue with htsjdk I think). This leads to an insidious bug, where a sorted vcf can be fed through SelectVariants, and depending on the flavor of output vcf, either crash, or succeed but output an incorrectly sorted vcf. The issue is that in some circumstances SelectVariants will trim alleles to their minimal representation, which can change the location of a variant record, and thus reorder them. However, SelectVariants does nothing to account for the potential order change. Since vcfWriter implementations in htsjdk seem to do minimal/inconsistent checks on the order of variants being added to them, this may write out an incorrectly sorted vcf, or throw an exception, depending on the flavor of vcfWriter. . #### Steps to reproduce; With attached (zipped because github) vcf, run ; `gatk SelectVariants -V test.input.vcf -sn SAMPLE_01 -O test.output.vcf`; Tool will succeed, but output vcf will be incorrectly sorted. Somehow, this incorrectly sorted vcf will also be accompanied by an index!

When I run CombineGVCFs, the error indicates the first locus where there is a NON_REF allele. For example:. HiC_scaffold_2 12497 . T TC,* . My full process is as follows:; I run HaplotypeCaller on individual sample files using the -ERC GVCF command.; I combine the individual g.vcf files using CombineGVCFs. I do this separately for the three species I ultimately want to merge, although they are all mapped to the same reference genome.; I call multisample genotypes with GenotypeGVCFs, again for each species separately. At this point a sample that will fail the process in the future will look like:; HiC_scaffold_2 12497 . T TC,<NON_REF>. I now merge the multispecies genotyped files together using CombineGVCFs.; But then when I go to run GenotypeGVCFs, there is an error wherever there are more than two alleles. And as shown at the top of the message what was a <NON_REF> becomes a * and I get the message: ERROR input alleles must contain <NON_REF>. #### Expected behavior; I expected the g.vcf files to genotype across multiple samples so I can move forward with analyses.

Integrability,"## Bug Report; Hi, we are using the dockstore version of the GATK variant calling pipeline that leverages mutect 2:; [github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/mutect2:4.1.8.1](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/mutect2:4.1.8.1). We're processing human glioma data, and currently we are making it through much of the pipeline, but failing on `GetPileupSummaries`. There's a thread about it on the discussion board [here] (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/6179012337819-No-Pileup-Tables). . We are specifying a file for `variants_for_contamination`, and a file for `variants_for_contamination_idx` in the workflow, but the index is never passed to `GetPileupSummaries`, and it fails with this enigmatic error message:. ```; A USER ERROR has occurred: An index is required but was not found for file gs://bruce-processed-data/Prins_Cloughesy_Neoadjuvant/terra_reference_files/small_exac_common_3.hg38.vcf.gz.

If you check out the source code in [mutect2.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/4.1.8.1/scripts/mutect2_wdl/mutect2.wdl), you can see that that input variable `variants_for_contamination_idx`, which we have thoughtfully set and passed into the workflow, is never actually used in `GetPileupSummaries`.

Presently tools like Mutect2 and HaplotypeCaller ignore; soft-clipping by default. In some sequencing products that use long reads relative; to the insert size, the reads often contain some amount of adapter. These reads; are typically soft-clipped by upstream tools like MergeBamAlignments. The result is an increase in false positive rates in somatic samples that have long read lengths compared to insert size. These false positives can be eliminated using the `-no-soft-clips` option, but this ignores all soft clips regardless of why the read was soft-clipped. The proposal here is to add a new engine level argument that will allow GATK tools to ignore soft-clips that occur at the start position of the reads mate.

Integrability,"## Feature request. ### Tool(s) or class(es) involved; _FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark_, _StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark_, when using _XGBoostEvidenceFilter.java_. ### Description; The SV pipeline filters BreakpointEvidence based on BreakpointDensityFilter, or optionally XGBoostEvidenceFilter. The XGBoostEvidenceFilter uses a saved classifier model trained with Python code external to the GATK. This poses two main problems:; 1) The external Python code was designed for proof-of-principle and method development, not maintainability or ease of use. Additionally, GATK users and developers are assumed to be familiar with Java, not necessarily Python.; 2) The external Python code must share heterogeneous data with Java for unit/integration tests (supplying test BreakpointEvidence, expected classifier features, and expected classifier probabilities). Currently this is done via JSON files organized to (invertibly) store Pandas or Numpy objects. The resulting code to load these JSON files in on the Java side is complex.; These problems can be resolved by; 1) Replacing external python code by porting to an **experimental** tool in the GATK.; 2) Replacing JSON files with a serialization strategy currently supported by the GATK (e.g. Kryo). Additional benefits can be obtained by ensuring that the classifier-training subroutines are sufficiently general to speed development for other projects that may want to use boosted decision trees for classification.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4922:741,integrat,integration,741,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4922,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Make joint genotyping functionality available as a publicly accessible function to another class/program without passing through the GATK command line interface. ### Tool(s) or class(es) involved; VariantContext; GenotypeGVCFs; Underlying engine classes. ### Description; For various use cases where our pipelines produce in-memory VariantContext objects it would be faster and easier to pass these directly to a joint genotyping function and extract the results back into memory rather than writing to VCF, running the GenotypeGVCFs pipeline via the command line interface and then re-ingesting the resultant VCFs. From discussions during the GATK Working Group meetings it appears this request is similar in principle to existing functionality for the HaplotypeCaller that was implemented by ""extracting the engine"" from the HaplotypeCaller walkers so that it can be instantiated outside the command line utility. Ideally, this implementation should make it possible to instantiate any necessary engine classes pass VariantContext objects directly to the GenotypeGVCFs.apply or GenotypeGVCFs.regenotypeVC and receive the re-genotyped VariantContext objects back for further processing from Java code. . ----",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5910:171,interface,interface,171,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5910,2,['interface'],['interface']

CombineVariants has a way to annotate each site with which set the site belongs to. For example, if a site is in GIAB and failed hard filtering but passed VQSR, CombineVariants will annotate the site with set=G-filterInH-V.

VariantFiltration's --invalidate-previous-filters prevent any output variant to be marked as PASS even if it passes the filters that are passed to that run of the filtration tool. What I would expect is that variants that pass the current set of filters will be marked as PASS regarless whether they were filtered or not filtered (PASS, or '.') in the input. . Perhaps the case is that this option is not meant.to be used with current/new filters being specified as to provide a way to revert previous filtration, but in that case it should fail if new filters are specified. #### Steps to reproduce. Just try it out with a VCF with some filters already applied and run VF with additional filters that will not result in all variants to be filtered. . You will see that no output variant is set To PASS but rather are kept as unknown '.' . #### Expected behavior. Either it does fail if a new filter is applied in the same tool run or passing variants filter are setlp to Pw. #### Actual behavior.

Integrability,"### Background: jar dependency hell. Getting GATK to compile with the gcloud-java-nio dependency is already a little bit of a struggle because of conflicting versions of the com.google.protobuf class (see #2013). Running it on Dataproc results in a version conflict somewhere else, probably linked to the jars that are automatically included on Dataproc. Getting gcloud-java-nio to work on vanilla Spark runs into the exact same category of problems (dependency conflicts), see eg. [this question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38536004/spark-java-noclassdeffounderror-when-adding-dependency/38575957#38575957). The root of the problem is that both Hadoop and GCloud-Java rely on the same core Google libraries (Guava, Protobuf), but they use different versions that are incompatible. Java is not currently able to have two different versions of the same library at once, so instead you end up forcing one version of the other. Neither version appears to work for all of our dependencies, so we have a problem.; ### Workaround. Barring improvements in Java, our only way forward may be to use a shaded ""fat jar"" version of gcloud-java-nio that (i) includes all of its dependencies in a single jar and (ii) renames the shared dependencies so they won't conflict with what eg. Hadoop brings in. Luckily, gcloud-java-nio already builds such a jar by default. However that jar is not published on Maven Central. So the solution is to download the gcloud-java-nio source code, compile it ourselves (without any modification), and use the resulting jar (target/gcloud-java-nio-0.2.7-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar). . This solution works for both vanilla Spark and GATK. I suspect it would be acceptable for us to directly include that jar in our source tree so that our own users wouldn't have to take any special steps to use GATK: just compile and run, as usual. Let's discuss.

Integrability,"### Feature request. I would like to be able to pull out the indel allele only from mixed records. I'm told this would take the form of a flag that would modify the -selectType behavior to additionally reach into mixed records and subset alleles. If this feature will be addressed, then it also needs to be backported to gsa-unstable. Additionally, I would like to be able to pull out variants based on allele frequency cutoff, e.g. `-select ""AF> [#]""`. This is so I can pull out common and low-frequency variants to the exclusion of rare variants. Currently using this option with the Phase 3 1000 Genomes vcf this gives the following error:. ```; ##### ERROR MESSAGE: Invalid JEXL expression detected for select-0 with message ![0,10]: 'AF > 0.001;' > error; ```. Laura says this error has do with multiallelic sites. Searching the forum for ""JEXL, AF, multiallelic"" I find two relevant discussions (links below) that tell me to do things well beyond my abilities.

Integrability,"* The performance should be fine - TileDB/GenomicsDB stores each field in a separate file (columnar storage) and so adding MIN_DP file to the list of queried fields (~5-10 INFO fields) should be fine.; * One possible source of performance improvement - I was querying the PL field in the sites only query (not producing it in the output VariantContext objects). I think it can be dropped from the query. I was assuming that the PL field would be needed to correctly handle spanning deletions (spanning deletion corresponds to deletion allele with min PL). However, for spanning deletions, all INFO fields are dropped. Hence, any INFO fields that depend on the allele order (allele specific annotations) would be dropped for the spanning deletion. Hence, the exact deletion allele corresponding to the spanning deletion is irrelevant making it possible to drop the PL field from the query as well.

Integrability,"* _Large number of open file handles_: this was an issue in TileDB which got fixed as part of the restructuring that @nalinigans did for supporting HDFS/S3/GCS (#5017). I was too lazy to fix this again. If it's going to take some time for PR #5017 to be merged, I can submit a separate fix for this. This would fix any crashes/termination issues.; * _Performance of a single import process with a large number of intervals_; * Restating the obvious, but this is a single process (and by default, a single thread) with many intervals to import. As you increase the number of samples, this will become a performance pain point.; * More important than the number of intervals is the amount of data imported per interval. Each interval import involves opening the VCF files (loading index structures while creating FeatureReader objects), writing to TileDB/GenomicsDB. and closing the VCF file handles (destroying FeatureReader objects). If the amount of data written for each interval is sufficiently large, the cost of opening/closing the VCF files (creating/destroying FeatureReaders) is small relative to the total time taken.; * In the test cases I and Chris were trying, the amount of data written per interval was small (or 0 in many cases). The time taken in opening/closing the VCF files (and loading/destroying the index) dominates the total time.; * For a single import process (single thread), creating a large interval is better (or no worse) than passing several small intervals. TileDB/GenomicsDB has 0 overhead for regions with no data (for example, WES gVCFs). Having larger intervals will likely avoid issues described above. Hence, an advisory message will be beneficial.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5066#issuecomment-410576757:1659,message,message,1659,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5066#issuecomment-410576757,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"**Spanning Deletion Changes**. 1. Created a new SpanningDeletionRecord as a subclass of ReferenceRecord but allows us to store GT and GQ; 2. in handlePotentialSpanningDeletion when processing a deletion, we create a new SpanningDeletionRecord with the correct GT and GQ based on the deletion; 3. When processing reference data at a variant site, return ReferenceRecords/SpanningDeletionRecord instead of just a string ""state"" since we need more than just state now; 4. Because of the above, we are now returning an object for the inferred state instead of just a string. Since the inferred state is so, so common a singleton InferredReferenceRecord was created; 5. Processing of spanning deletions beyond. **Ugly**; 1. The construction of the singleton is ugly because it _requires_ a location even though we don't for this case. We could go to an tagging interface (like Cloneable) these all implement, but that seems ugly also. *Refactoring Changes*; One of the challenges with this PR was testing as the work is really done in the lower-level methods and it would be nice to have this as a unit test rather than an integration/end-to-end test. This motivated the following changes:. 1. don't write to VCF directly, instead have take a Consumer<VariantContext> to emit VariantContexts. This let's us provide a different consumer in unit tests to collect our result.; 2. we previously had a chain of calls createVariantsFromSortedRanges -> processSampleRecordsForLocation -> finalizeCurrentVariant that returned void and as a side effect wrote to VCF. These deeper methods now return a VariantContext and the writing (via consumer) is done higher up in the call stack; 3. made some private methods package-private so we could call them from tests. **Thinking Out Loud**. We have three different sets of datastructures for the same data, some of this is history, some is performance/memory, but could use some rethinking; 1. GenericRecord (pulling from BQ); 2.

Integrability,"----. ## Bug Report. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); Mutect2, Haplotypecaller. ### Affected version(s); 4.1.0. ### Description ; It is not an actual accuracy bug but I wanted to share it with you in case you are not aware of it. If you look at BaseGraph.java. There are 4 places that you use ""Collectors.toSet()"". This converts a stream to an unordered set. The final order is dependant on the memory address that each element occupies so the order of result unordered set is not deterministic and can differ from run to run. . This behavior is not problematic as long as we do not traverse the set in order. But let's look at MergeDiamonds.java as an example; ` final Set<SeqVertex> middles = getGraph().outgoingVerticesOf(top);; `; ` for ( final SeqVertex mi : middles ) {; `; First, we make unordered set ""middles"" and then traverse it. Merging diamonds is actually really sensitive which diamond you merge first and can result in different graphs if you change the order. This was not that important before but it seems that with the new chain pruning functionality that you put in mutect2. Sensitivity went up. and now we can actually see different results every time we run the mutect2. I was wondering if it makes sense to change this? The way that we fixed it for ourselves was to change it to linkedHashSet to preserve the order. _Tool/class name(s), parameters?_. ### Description ; _Describe what needs to be added or modified._. ----",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6003:380,depend,dependant,380,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6003,1,['depend'],['dependant']

Integrability,"...because it does the following:; - makes it appear no variants were left-aligned when in fact many were left-aligned. ; - In addition, because the tool emits an INFO message for sites that it skips (due to reference allele being too long), it appears doubly confusing as if the tool skips sites that could use left-alignment and only these types of skipped sites are present.; - Finally, for my file, it drops 66,568 variant sites (I did not check alleles) for me silently and without any warning. ## Two suggestions for improvement for LeftAlign's stdout:; 1. A count of variants/sites that were left-aligned OR at least NOT the confusing `0 variants were aligned` message.; 2. The length of the longest reference allele that the tool skipped.; 3.

I don't think this is coming from the content of the VCF as it works well in some cases. Let me know if you need me to make other tests. Fred. ----. ## Update. I investigated a little further after thinking about the tests I did. Because modifying the VCF filename did not trigger the issue and because of the presence of `tabix` related modules in the traces, I decided to see if removing `tbi` file will avoid having the error message. And it did!. After recreating the `tbi` file (`tabix data/calling/cerc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz`), the error message appeared again. So it does not seem related to malformed index file. However, index file seems part of the problem. After renaming `test a` folder in `test-a` with the old or new index file, I did not get any error (as usual).

Integrability,"/github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/914#issuecomment-280820307). @yfarjoun, thanks for your comments. On the first two points, I agree. Let me clarify: I was going to use the bait-length and insert-length as _hyperparameters_ of the pdf, where the pdf itself gives the probability of having an insert in a certain configuration relative to the bait. I think the parametrization you proposed, i.e. the distance between nearest ends of insert and bait, is very reasonable since the PDF is going to be reflection-symmetric once averaged over all baits; and you're right, the bait length is constant (77bp for ICE) so we can drop it from the analysis. If the fragment capture efficiency is insensitive to the relative position of the bait sequence in the fragment, we expect the pdf to be approximately uniform (save for boundary effects at the scale of bait length), with the 0.5 x (insert length - bait length) setting the upper bound of the distribution. However, some dependency on the position of the bait is expected: e.g. if the bait sequence is on the dangling end of a fragment, it is less likely to stay bound than if it is in the middle of the fragment. I'm curious to see what comes out (who knows -- maybe another 6-bp periodicity!). Regarding GC bias -- I agree with what you said; I guess I had a different point, though. To find the GC curve, one needs to regress the _coverage depth_ wrt. the _GC content_ in some way. Now, all we have is a collection of baits, along with the number of inserts pulled by each bait (let's call it the bait pileup). So, we have to designate a measure of _GC content_ to each bait pileup in order to regress the pileup size against it. A reasonable choice is to use the expected value of the GC content of the pulled fragments for each bait:. effective GC of a bait = \sum_{all inserts} GC(insert) x Pr(insert) x Pr(insert is pulled by bait). Alternatively, we can calculate the average GC content of each bait pileup, for each sample, as we ca",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2947:7048,depend,dependency,7048,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2947,1,['depend'],['dependency']

OK it turns out that the reference is hard masked and has ""N"" in that region. Nevertheless, we shouldn't get NaNs. In my opinion, the correct behavior is to drop targets on which GC percentage can not be defined + emit informative error messages. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Sun Sep 11 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/651#issuecomment-246177779). I will address this. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Tue Sep 27 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/651#issuecomment-250018497). @davidbenjamin also, CorrectGCBias produces NaNs when a sample has very low coverage. I think the correct behavior is this:. (1) when annotating targets, it is OK to produce NaNs on targets whose GC bias can not be determined. When correcting for GC bias, those targets must be removed altogether. (2) if the bias curve can not be determined (let's say because of low coverage), the tool should remove that sample from the collection and emit appropriate warning messages. If all samples are removed, the tool should produce a bad input error. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Thu May 18 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/651#issuecomment-302466279). @asmirnov239 can you review and if the issue is resolved, close?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2882:4762,message,messages,4762,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2882,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"1. Add new arg `genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations` to help with shared posix filesystems like NFS and Lustre. This turns on `disable file locking` and for GenomicsDB import it minimizes writes to disks. The performance on some of the gatk datasets for the import of about 10 samples went from 23.72m to 6.34m on NFS which was comparable to importing to a local filesystem. Hopefully this helps with Issue #6487 and #6627. Also, fixes Issue #6519.; 2. This version of GenomicsDB also uses pre-compression filters for offset and compression files for new workspaces and genomicsdb arrays. The total sizes for a GenomicsDB workspace using the same dataset as above and the 10 samples went from 313MB to 170MB with no change in import and query times. Smaller GenomicsDB arrays also help with performance on distributed and cloud file systems.; 3. This version has added support to handle MNVs similar to deletions as described in Issue #6500. See [GenomicsDB PR 88](https://github.com/GenomicsDB/GenomicsDB/pull/88). Thanks @kgururaj.; 4. There is added support in the GenomicsDBImporter to have multiple contigs in the same GenomicsDB partition/array. This will hopefully help import times in cases where users have many thousands of contigs. See [GenomicsDB PR 91](https://github.com/GenomicsDB/GenomicsDB/pull/91). Changes will be needed from the gatk side to avail this support. Thanks @mlathara.; 5. Logging has been improved somewhat with the native C/C++ code using [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) and [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) and the Java layer using apache log4j and log4j.properties provided by the application.

OK it turns out that the reference is hard masked and has ""N"" in that region. Nevertheless, we shouldn't get NaNs. In my opinion, the correct behavior is to drop targets on which GC percentage can not be defined + emit informative error messages. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Sun Sep 11 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/651#issuecomment-246177779). I will address this. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Tue Sep 27 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/651#issuecomment-250018497). @davidbenjamin also, CorrectGCBias produces NaNs when a sample has very low coverage. I think the correct behavior is this:. (1) when annotating targets, it is OK to produce NaNs on targets whose GC bias can not be determined. When correcting for GC bias, those targets must be removed altogether. (2) if the bias curve can not be determined (let's say because of low coverage), the tool should remove that sample from the collection and emit appropriate warning messages. If all samples are removed, the tool should produce a bad input error. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Thu May 18 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/6",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2882:4002,message,messages,4002,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2882,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"96/76560439-85638880-6477-11ea-8d8d-f0f9a11d70a6.png). We can compare against the new workflow, in which we run SegmentJointSamples to jointly segment on the two mixtures. This yields a joint-sample segmentation with 162 segments, which can be passed as an additional input to individual ModelSegments runs on the two mixtures. It is used as the initial segmentation for both runs, after which the usual modelling and smoothing steps are performed. For the 75% tumor + 25% normal mixture, this yields 122 segments (up from 83):; ![N-25-T-75-SJS modeled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/76558618-015bd180-6474-11ea-996a-48d39770149b.png). For the 25% tumor + 75% normal mixture, this yields 105 segments (up from 50):; ![N-75-T-25-SJS modeled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/76560726-34a05f80-6478-11ea-9027-a54726c46b9e.png). One could imagine that smoothing could be disabled (so that all samples retain the common segmentation after modeling) or made more aggressive (so that private events don't get inadvertently introduced into other samples due to noise, perhaps), depending on the use case. It looks like the joint segmentation allows some additional events to be resolved, although I haven't done any rigorous evaluations. We could probably cook up some evaluations using simulated toy data or in silico mixtures, but there's really no reason why this shouldn't work decently well, especially if the kernel-segmentation method works well on a single sample for your data. It would also be interesting to understand at which point changing segmentation parameters on a single sample can no longer yield the same performance as joint segmentation on a fixed number of samples; however, this is probably a function of various S/N ratios, and it might not be easy to characterize this behavior outside of toy data. The segmentation parameter space is big enough to make this unwieldy even for toy data, too. Perhaps we can get some feedback from test users-",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-598386823:1859,depend,depending,1859,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-598386823,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"; and indicate how each API function is affected by this. If certain ; methods behave differently, then people writing code against SAMRecord ; need to anticipate this; and existing code may need to be updated. In other words, headerless ; SAMRecords should become ""part of the spec"". Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and complexity of the header tag might also depend on the ; execution environment. If the execution environment only supports a ; small finite number of headers, the header tag could be a small integer, ; or in a different execution environment it could be; a unique hash of the header or something like that. Memory footprint in ; the receiver is minimized because many SAMRecords can all share the same ; header object.; This requires more work to support in each execution environment, but it ; seems like it could be efficient and allows application code written to ; operate on SAMRecords to be portable; across different execution environments without having to contend with ; the possible presence of headerless SAMRecords. -Bob.

Integrability,"> The point of the singleton pattern is for testing: tests can substitute their own instance instead of the default one. They put in a mock that doesn't need to call out to the internet - this way it's both faster and self-contained (as unit tests are supposed to be). Using a singleton should not be needed, since mocks are sufficient in this case. I think the difficulty is that there are two objects, `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata`, which need managing separately. The need for a singleton disappears if the objects are combined into one, e.g. by subsuming `RefAPIMetadata` into `RefAPISource`. Then the issue may be that you want to ensure that the lookup table is not recreated too often (since it is expensive), but I think that can be solved by ensuring that there is a single instance in a test (by using TestNG's `@BeforeClass`). > We still need some way to stub, because there are places deep in the code that call RefApiSource.getInstance(). This goes away if you remove the need for a singleton, like in this PR. > We could have a getDataflowInstance() and a getSparkInstance() - the former would normally return the code formerly known as RefApiSource, except if tests set up the mock. . I think it's better to have a uniform interface to get references, so that callers don't need to know if the reference is being retrieved via the Google API, a file on HDFS, or a local file.

Integrability,"> Your solution doesn't address your third listed drawback to the current; approach. Ah, but I believe it does if you're careful. We have this code:; ```; for ( final AssemblyResult result : assemble(correctedReads, refHaplotype, givenHaplotypes, header, aligner) ) {; if ( result.getStatus() == AssemblyResult.Status.ASSEMBLED_SOME_VARIATION ) {; // do some QC on the graph; sanityCheckGraph(result.getGraph(), refHaplotype);; // add it to graphs with meaningful non-reference features; assemblyResultByGraph.put(result.getGraph(),result);; nonRefGraphs.add(result.getGraph());; }; }. findBestPaths(nonRefGraphs, refHaplotype, refLoc, activeRegionExtendedLocation, assemblyResultByGraph, resultSet, aligner);; ```; If assembly fails eg due to cycles at every kmer then there's nothing to iterate over in the `for` loop but it still reaches `findBestPaths` (this puts assembled haplotypes into `resultSet` as a side effect, and it forces the reference haplotype in by fiat if there are no graphs). As long as the new GGA haplotypes are added after `findBestPaths` and not anywhere inside the `assemble` method or in that `for` loop it should be okay. Would you like me to write an integration test for this case?. > It's not obvious to me why we wanted the given alleles in the graph; originally. . . Regardless of the reason, I think the new proposal captures any benefit of putting them in the graph, because if they *are* in the graph it leaves them alone.

Integrability,">--af_of_alleles_not_in_resource: is this allele frequency used only in certain contexts, e.g. with matched normal analyses, or towards tumor sample variant alleles, etc.? I need to add to the doc details how this argument factors into calculations. This is the population AF assigned to a variant not found in the germline resource and is inversely proportional to the number of samples used to create that resource. For example, gnomAD contains about 16,000 wgs samples, or 32,000 homologs per locus. Thus the AF of an allele not found in gnomAD is probably 1/32,000 or less. This is useful because it lets us use absence from the germline resource as evidence that an allele is *not* a germline variant. >I need a sentence or two describing the new algorithmic improvement on the new Mutect2 integration over uncertainty. Since allele depths (ADs) are subject to statistical error -- i.e. the exact number of reads for an allele is a random variable -- alleles' allele fractions are not known. Previously, M2 estimated allele fractions ffrom the ADs and proceeded with the likelihoods calculation. Now M2 uses nifty math to account for the uncertainty in the allele fraction when calculating likelihoods. In statistical language (which *will* be familiar to a decent-sized minority of users) we marginalize over allele fractions instead of using a maximum likelihood estimate. >The WDLs do not include use of a contamination.table and so I did not include it in the commands. Is this something we want to nudge users to use, i.e. should I put in a sentence in the documentation section about the new tool CalculateContamination?. `CalculateContamination` is invoked inside the `Filter` task in mutect2.wdl.

Assuming there aren't any dependency conflicts it **should** (always a risky statement) be independent from everything else. . Thanks also for identifying the different issues you mentioned. It's expected that it won't work with most picard tools as you discovered, but we're actively in the process of updating more of them too support Paths instead of Files so that will slowly improve. The second issue is more worrisome. We regularly use an equivalent provider with google to read reference files through the exact same code, so I suspect there is either some sort of mismatched assumptions in the way they are handling things. Maybe something strange with the Path.resolve methods or the like. (Or in in the much worse potential case a bug in their look ahead caching.). I'd like to look into that before we'd merge this.

Integrability,"@LeeTL1220 do you have any opinions on making the somatic CNV workflow scatter by contig? This could allow WGS to complete basically ~20x faster and could allow us to avoid issues such as #4734. A few issues:. 1) Do we want a single WDL that can optionally scatter, depending on WES vs. WGS? It would be nicer to have just one workflow, but I haven't thought about how an optional scatter might look in WDL. 2) For segmentation and modeling, scattering should have little impact on the final result (although there are a few global-level quantities in the models that would be reduced to contig-level quantities, which might slightly affect the quality of their inference). However, we'd want to concatenate all per-contig results for both plotting and segment calling. It'd be relatively easy to either have a separate tool to concatenate AbstractLocatableCollections (there is already a method to do this that is used for the gCNV pipeline), or to make the plotting and calling tools take in parallel inputs and combine them.

I have one suggestion to consider, but if you think it's too much work or not worth it feel free to skip: what if we separated out the reference bundle to copy from the data by specifying them both in the cluster name? That way we could, say, load either the hg19 or hg38 reference depending on the data we might be working with. So you could say ""cluster-hg38"" or ""cluster-hg19"" or ""cluster-hg19-na12878"". . Carrying it further, if we had a special convention for specifying data, like ""data-$SAMPLE"", we could just map $SAMPLE to a subdirectory on the bucket. That would provide a ton of flexibility.

Integrability,"@TearsWillFall @LRFreeborn I suspect that the environment you're running in has the wrong tensorflow version for some reason. The keras issue is a known TF/keras version incompatibility (see for example [this explanation](https://tensorexamples.com/2020/08/02/Keras.backend-has-no-attribute-get_session.html)). I'd guess that somehow you're getting TF 2.x as opposed to the TF 1.15 that GATK uses. I would recommend against directly modifying the python code - we use that same code and conda environment every day in our CI environment and on our docker, and it works there, so I suspect this is a dependency issue that is somewhat platform dependent.

Integrability,"@TedBrookings which formats are you using, in particular? If there is a format out there that nicely fits our needs, we should adopt it. In the CNV package, I've taken pains to unify how tabular data are represented in Java, depending on whether each record is Locatable or whether the collection of records can be associated with a sample name or sequence dictionary. This allows us to represent records that extend Locatable with *multidimensional numerical or non-numerical annotations* along with some metadata (sample name and sequence dictionary) with a minimum of boilerplate. There are also base methods for producing interval trees, etc. This pretty much satisfies all of the CNV team's needs (and is, in my opinion, a necessary improvement over the horrowshow of read/write utility methods for each file format that we had previously...). However, this unification effort was a quick push I made before release, so some polishing or redesigning may be warranted. We may also want to add more forms of metadata, etc. if other teams would require more features. Another downside is that this code lacks the indexing, NIO support, etc. that some of the other standardized/Tribble formats enjoy. For CNV data, this isn't a huge issue, but I think it would be nice to unify how we represent such data GATK-wide. As I said above, I don't think VCF is the correct answer, but certainly it could fit into whatever framework we adopt or come up with.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-385656468:225,depend,depending,225,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-385656468,1,['depend'],['depending']

Since the reads come off the aligner sorted by name, this would spare us at least one shuffle (the group by name). We could then probably get away with just a single join on position (either individual position or the concatenation of position + mate position, depending on whether each read is paired) to make the rest of the existing algorithm work.

Integrability,"@akiezun @lindenb I can help. It's probably going to be a slightly complicated process though, especially actually building the cross platform jar. I assume we're targeting OSX and x86-64 to start with, and then hopefully expanding to POWER8 in the future? . The general idea is to prebuild the c code for whatever platforms we want to support. Then package that in a structured way into a jar, and write some java code which will detect the platform at runtime and extract the correct executable into a temporary location. Then we can publish that jar as a maven artifact. We have an example of how to do the extraction in the `VectorLoglessPairHMM` constructor. It's not perfect and probably needs a bit of refactoring to make it more general but it's the right idea. Other libraries that package native code have similar examples. I.e. Snappy-java https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java.

Integrability,"@asmirnov239 Thanks for implementing this. After our conversation, I realized that the GATK3 version of the `--force-active` argument works a bit differently: it sets all of the individual per-locus probabilities of being active to 1.0, rather than preserving the true probabilities and just setting every region's `isActive` flag to true, as you're doing here. Ie., GATK3 does this:. ```; private void addIsActiveResult(final ActiveRegionWalker<M, T> walker,; final RefMetaDataTracker tracker, final ReferenceContext refContext,; final AlignmentContext locus) {; // must be called, even if we won't use the result, to satisfy walker contract; final ActivityProfileState state = walker.isActive( tracker, refContext, locus );; if ( walker.forceActive) state.isActiveProb = 1.0;; if ( ! walkerHasPresetRegions ) {; activityProfile.add(state);; }; }; ```. I'm not convinced that the GATK3 behavior is actually better. It almost seems preferable to me to keep the true ""is active"" probabilities intact (so that you get realistic region boundaries), and just tell the `HaplotypeCallerEngine` to treat all of the resulting regions as active, as you're doing in this branch, instead of overwriting all of the isActive probabilities with 1.0 as GATK3 did. But maybe there is a good argument in favor of the GATK 3 behavior. Let's see what other people think -- @ldgauthier @davidbenjamin could you please weigh in as to which of the two `--force-active` implementations described above you'd prefer?

Integrability,"@asmirnov239 commented on [Wed Oct 19 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/751). Things that we discussed with @samuelklee that can be done to aid it:. -I think that all files we generate for individual case samples---""ReadCountCollection"" files for coverage profiles, ""AllelicCountCollection"" files for het pulldowns, and segment files---should contain the sample name as metadata in a header comment with a common tag (e.g., #sampleName = ...). Currently, these sample names are stored in column headers, in the fields of a SAMPLE column, or not at all, depending on the type of file. This would drastically simplify the use of the SampleNameFinder class, which would basically only contain a single method to parse this header comment and return the name. -CLIs that generate a file from an input BAM (CalculateTargetCoverage, GetHetCoverage, etc.) should take the sample name from that BAM by default. Since these are the first steps in our workflows, we could also optionally allow the user to specify a sample name different from that in the BAM. -Subsequent CLIs should then take the sample name from the header comment. -CLIs that take multiple non-BAM input files should check for consistency of the sample names as part of the argument validation step. -CLIs that output the sample name in plots should derive these from the header comment. -For files that contain data from multiple samples (e.g., the output of CombineReadCounts), we can probably leave the sample names in the column headers, but it would be nice to output the type of data stored in a header comment as well (e.g., PCOV or RAW). At some point I think we should restrict to RAW output only, see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/615. -Entity names specified by the input file for the WDLs can be separate from the BAM sample names by default.

Integrability,"@bbimber - here some answers:. * The `LocusWalker` in the GATK4 framework provides the traversal over each locus, and provides the information for the reference (`ReferenceContext`) and the pileup (`AlignmentContext`). I guess that this is similar to a rod-walker in the previous framework if a `FeatureInput` is present (accessed by the `FeatureContext`); * The apply function params are never null, but they may be empty. The reference context could be tested if it is empty by using `hasBackingDataSource()`. Other contexts can be tested with other methods to check if they are empty.; * For auto-discovery of feature inputs, mark the field with `FeatureInput<>` for the type of feature that you want; if you require more than one, a list of `FeatureInput` can be provided. Then, the features for the feature class can be retrieved from the `FeatureContext` on the apply function.; * For argument exceptions, use the ones in `UserException` or `CommandLineProgramException`, depending on which one fits better on your use case...

Integrability,"@bbimber question for you - what is the primary motivation for wanting to merge the scattered workspaces back into a single workspace here? I'm assuming the scatter is because you have a large enough dataset that you need multiple nodes to run the import in parallel. (side note: we're planning on enabling reading vcfs through native htslib in GenomicsDBImport which should drive down memory usage for cases that are able to take advantage of that route. This might make it more feasible to use `--max-intervals-to-import-in-parallel` for multiple threads on a single node ). If the large dataset is the primary reason, wouldn't you want the benefits of distributed processing on the query side as well? You mentioned in the previous thread that you saw the fact that a single workspace is a valid GenomicsDB workspace as a benefit...and that's certainly true - but if performance is the driving factor then it might be worth it to keep the workspace separate. @droazen Could you elaborate on what you envision we should do here?

Integrability,"@bhandsaker In hellbender we do already ship the header around ""out-of-band"" much as you described (via the spark broadcast mechanism and the dataflow ""side input"" mechanism), and use that header singleton for operations such as looking up the sample, library, platform, etc. We wrote utility methods in hellbender that take both a read and a separate header for all operations that previously required a header within the read, to avoid having to actually restore the header into the reads themselves after every operation that involves a shuffle over the network. Our goal is just to ensure that `SAMRecord` behaves in a consistent, well-documented way when it lacks a header without imposing any additional burden on other users of htsjdk.

Integrability,"@bhandsaker Thanks for chiming in with your thoughts/concerns. Under this proposal, the various classes in htsjdk that read and return `SAMRecords` (eg., `SAMReader` & co.) would continue to put the header inside of the records, so we would not be imposing an additional burden on direct clients of htsjdk to check for null headers any more than they do currently. The only difference is that if downstream consumers of `SAMRecords` (like hellbender) choose to strip the header from the records, there would be an explicit contract governing the behavior of headerless `SAMRecords` (as opposed to the status quo, in which the header may be null but behavior is totally undocumented and in some cases inconsistent -- eg., the reference name and index in a headerless `SAMRecord` can get out-of-sync in some cases). . In addition to documenting/clarifying the behavior of headerless `SAMRecords` and fixing any consistency-related bugs we find when operating without a header, we would also make an effort to document when a class in htsjdk that consumes `SAMRecords` requires that a header be present in the records (such as the various writer classes).

Integrability,"@cmnbroad - I am not concern about the methods, because they are perfectly configurable, and actually this issue is not that important for some of my projects (e.g., `ReadTools`), which does not use the base walker clases from GATK. Nevertheless, I guess that what @droazen is suggesting is quite important and I appreciate the interest for making better the downstream toolkits integration. Here, a real use case: I've just started to write a new toolkit that will use some walker classes from GATK (by now, `LocusWalker` or the `ReadSliderWalker` from #4682). With the current way of configuring the output, I will need to implement a layer for both walker classes (e.g., `MyLocusWalker` and `MyReadSliderWalker`) and use them in my implemented tools. In addition, I would like to bundle some tools from the GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:379,integrat,integration,379,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,2,"['integrat', 'message']","['integration', 'messages']"

Beyond that, most of the code juggle symbolic tensors that ultimately get compiled by theano into one giant _step function_.

The ultimate requirement from the computational core is to (1) make correct inferences on simulated data, (2) pass certain sensitivity/specificity requirements on real data.; I vote for _not_ unit testing the python package (except for I/O), and to treat it as a black box with certain required specifications.

Integrability,"@cmnbroad I figured I'd bump an old issue rather than create a new one, but my group would also appreciate if more gatk tools supported stdin / stdout. I've noticed that several of the Picard versions of tools support reading from stdin, but the Spark gatk replacements do not. MarkDuplicates is a big one, MarkDuplicates accepts /dev/stdin as input, but MarkDuplicateSpark does not. For the spark tools, this may be more work because they are chunking the file and splitting it across threads / processes, but it would be great if there were a solution for GATKPath / HtsPath to identify that we're operating on stdin / stdout and not use Files.newInputStream, and instead did something like wrap System.in in a BufferedReader if that's more appropriate. I realize that not all tools will be able to do this, because clearly you can't get random I/O to a file through a pipe, but there are plenty of tools that just read a single large file once through.

Integrability,"@cmnbroad OK, considerable progress here. I was able to adjust behavior such that only two tests have changed behavior from GATK4/master. I think this is now correct. One instance of changed behavior is the Snpeff/overlap one we discussed above. The second is the one where we now provide the full genome as REF, not the truncated genome. I think this difference is justified since the tool now requires a reference, and the prior version was arguably too lenient on validation of contigs. Anyway, this branch now also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round. As noted above, I'd like to propose this as iterative, with a second PR coming soon. I did this b/c it moved us toward not needing to pass around the walker. It minimizes the code that has access to the walker (as opposed to setting it after creating the instance of the Evaluator, etc. Yes, it exposes it for two methods, but those classes no longer hang on to it.

Integrability,"@cmnbroad On these blocking PRs. The core point is to provide a way to link FeatureInput to VariantContext. The existing PRs stash FeatureInput name as the VariantContext source. I dont know if there are internal deliberations or anything holding up getting those done, or blocking my offer to try to implement that. However, I wonder what you think about a possible alternate approach. The driving use for this feature is MultiVariantWalkers and their subclasses. Another way to tackle this might be to hook into MultiVariantDataSource. One could create a wrapper class:. ```; public class VariantContextWithSource {; VariantContext variant;; FeatureInput source;; }. ```; And the iterator layer would wrap the VariantContext objects with this class, making a non-text link to FeatureInput. And perhaps either a) apply() would get called with this wrapper instead of VariantContext, or b) MultiVariantWalker might be able to get converted into MultiVariantWalker<T> where T is the class provided to apply().

Integrability,"@cmnbroad The path to the c++ compiler can be specifically provided to theano by setting `theano.config.cxx` in python scripts, or by creating a `.theanorc` in the home directory, or by setting the environmental variable `THEANO_FLAGS=cxx=<path_to_g++>,...`. If a working c++ compiler exists and provided to theano, it is fair to assume that the graph _will_ compile. If the c++ compiler is not explicitly specified, theano will try to discover it. It first tries to execute `g++ -v` in the present environment and if it succeeds, it resolves the absolute path to the executable. On darwin, it further searches for `clang++` and on Win32, it looks for a working mingw gcc setup. We could _enforce_ the presence of a c++ compiler at the beginning of all python scripts and throw an exception and an informative message instead of numpy/python fallback.

Integrability,"@cmnbroad commented on [Mon Apr 10 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/982). By default, Gradle resolves version dependency conflicts amongst transitive dependencies by choosing the newest version of any particular module that has conflicts. GATK public overrides this and forces resolution to specific versions for some modules like htsjdk and protobuf, but gatk-protected doesn't. So gatk-protected can wind up using a different version of a dependent module than GATK uses. This is currently happening with protobuf, but it could happen with htsjdk or other modules. Short term, we probably want to use ""force"" resolution for htsjdk and protobuf in gatk-protected (ideally to force them to be resolved to the ones pulled in via the gatk dependency). Longer term, we should probably use a resolution policy of ""failOnVersionConflict"" in both gatk and protected, which will force us to manually resolve any conflicts as they arise, rather than depending on Gradle to do the resolution for us. ---. @droazen commented on [Mon Apr 10 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/982#issuecomment-293032625).

Integrability,"@cmnbroad, that's not wholly unreasonable, but i'd like to push back on a number of these points. . 1) First - would GATK consider simply letting us take over VariantEval and maintain as a GATK4-based tool in another repo? My understanding from GATK4 issues is that plan was to never migrate VariantEval (i think in favor of other picard/gatk QC tools). There is a bit of a conflict between keeping a lean core engine and having all these tools built off it. I would think there's an argument for keeping your core engine and the many tools built off it separated (GATK3 seemed to include some dead tools, for example). I appreciate we're the ones pushing this migration, but I hope on the other side you can appreciate the bar is pretty significant on our time. . 2) What new plugins are you talking about? VariantStratification and VariantEvaluator are part of GATK3's VariantEval? Yeah, I wrote a base PluginDescriptor class patterned on how ReadFilters work. It probably should exist in a more core position in code. While there's some good ideas in the argument-parsing/plugin code of GATK/Barlcay, frankly seems like much of it isnt fully developed yet, which is why I kept this separated at the moment. . 3) Be aware, the GATK3 tests depend on ~30GB of files.

Integrability,"@cwhelan & @ldgauthier sorry for the delay on getting back this issue. Firstly, I just grabbed the new release (4.0.12.0) and re-ran with that to generate both gVCF and VCF. The VCF output still generates the 1/1 genotype unfortunately. What's interesting though is that the gVCF is capturing the spanning allele! So it looks like `GenotypeGVCFs` is causing the problem. Here are the rows from the gVCF and VCF respectively (with INFO elided for compactness):. ```; # gVCF; chr6 42932200 . GGC TGT,<NON_REF> 1623.73 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:SB 0/1:39,44,0:83:99:1661,0,1458,1778,1591,3369:10,29,14,30; chr6 42932202 . C T,*,<NON_REF> 3439.77 .

C T 3439.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 1/1:1,37:82:99:1807,141,0; ```. For completeness I also ran HaplotypeCaller going direct to VCF without making a gVCF first. The results are fairly similar to the VCF above, except for some AD/DP differences:. ```; # Direct to VCF; chr6 42932200 . GGC TGT 1623.73 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 0/1:39,44:83:99:1661,0,1458; chr6 42932202 . C T 3439.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 1/1:1,50:51:99:1807,141,0; ```. Going back to what's the right representation - I think I largely agree with @nh13 and @ldgauthier that long term it would be nice, when running with MNP support, to integrate the two haplotypes into a single variant output. But that sounds like it might be a big project and not happening any time soon? In the meantime if there's an easier fix to have the `*`/spanning allele called in the VCF propagated into the genotyped VCF that would really help.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5523#issuecomment-449758576:1415,integrat,integrate,1415,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5523#issuecomment-449758576,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Integrability,"@cwhelan @tedsharpe please review. There are 4 new classes here:. 1. LongHopscotchSet - based on HopscotchCollection/Set but adapted to store primitive longs instead of objects. The most significant bit is used to tell if a bucket is null or not, so the longs being stored must be non-negative. This works for use with k-mers, which we are assume are odd-length up to 31 and thus consume up to 62 bits.; 2. LargeLongHopscotchSet - for sets of longs greater than ~2 billion (the max Java array size) using a List of LongHopscotchSets.; 3. LongBloomFilter - Bloom filter for long's; 4. LargeLongBloomFilter - Bloom filter when the filter index size exceeds 2GB using a List of LongBloomFilters. - LongIterator and QueryableLongSet interfaces for convenience.; - Minor change to HopscotchSet max legal size, which was higher than the actual allowed Java array size. PS I just had a thought that the Bloom filters could use long instead of byte buckets to expand the max index size 8-fold. Could maybe be done for the Hopscotch sets as well, but with considerably more difficulty. Thoughts? On the other hand, the performance is already adequate so perhaps I'll save this idea for later.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2729:729,interface,interfaces,729,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2729,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"@cwhelan I've been thinking about this a lot more since we were looking at your integration test results. The PGT calls are inconsistent between HaplotypeCaller/CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs since we correct hom vars with 0|1 PGT in GGVCFs: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/851c8408d11042a402debf183d4fb69048a16c0e/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/GenotypeGVCFsEngine.java#L436; but I like the idea that the PGT is still showing that there are two different haplotypes at that site.

Integrability,"@david-wb Interesting... what version of spark / spark submit are you using? I was pretty sure that at the point where setMaster() was called by gatk the spark context was already created by yarn and setup with the appropriate master. I wonder if it changed from a previous version of spark... Alternatively, I may be misremembering and relying on the fact that our wrapper script supplies `--sparkMaster yarn` as a gatk argument which would probably override what's being set. Could you try:; ```; spark-submit \; --deploy-mode client \; --class org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main \; --master yarn \; /home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar BwaSpark \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. or with the wrapper: ; ```; GATK_SPARK_JAR_ENV_VARIABLE=/home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar. ./gatk-launch \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; -- \; --sparkRunner SPARK \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. Our wrapper script sets a number of properties which we think are important for running our spark tools. If running directly on spark you might want to set them explicitly. Things like `-Dsamjdk.compression_level=1` have MAJOR performance implications. . Also, be aware the BwaSpark is not in the best health at the moment may have issues.

Integrability,"@davidadamsphd Sure, here is a quick guide to the code:. -`BaseRecalibratorSpark` is the standalone BQSR tool, and calls into the `BaseRecalibratorSparkFn` (which is also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -`ApplyBQSRSpark` is the standalone ApplyBQSR tool, and calls into the `ApplyBQSRSparkFn` (also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -Integration tests for the above are in `BaseRecalibratorSparkIntegrationTest` and `ApplyBQSRSparkIntegrationTest`. -Almost all other changes in the branch are related to the BQSR engine refactoring, which I summarize below:; - We pulled out the guts of the walker `BaseRecalibrator` tool, combined it with all of the code from the former `RecalibrationEngine` class (now deleted) to make a new `BaseRecalibrationEngine` class under `utils/recalibration`.; - We stripped out all copies of the code in `BaseRecalibrationEngine` from the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of BQSR, and modified them to call into `BaseRecalibrationEngine`.; - We moved all auxiliary classes needed by the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` (eg., the covariates, etc.) into `utils/recalibration`.; - We refactored the argument collections. Now there is a single shared `RecalibrationArgumentCollection` that contains **only** the parameters for the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` itself, and this argument collection is exposed by all 3 versions of the tool. Input/output arguments have been removed from this argument collection and put into the individual implementations of BQSR, since they vary between the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of the tool. This eliminates awkward problems such as having both a `knownSites` argument AND a `BQSRKnownVariants` exposed at the same time, with only 1 of them usable for a given version of a tool. The dataflow-only `BaseRecalibrationArgumentCollection` has been deleted completely as no longer needed.; - We tweaked the names of some tool arguments to enforce consistency between the 3 versions of the tool as well as the rest of hellbender (eg.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073:338,Integrat,Integration,338,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073,1,['Integrat'],['Integration']
Integrability,"@davidadamsphd passing through would work, but it's going to take some work. And if we have to do this for every single object that may be different between Spark and Dataflow, we may have more interface-redefining ahead of us. There may be another way. Perhaps we can use the name of the ""referenceset"" to distinguish the cases, as ReferenceDataflowSource has started doing. It's already the case that if you're using RefAPI, your reference name is going to be gg://reference/_some_id_. This is easy to distinguish from e.g. a Hadoop DFS path. We could use a similar mechanism for the mocks: perhaps have a special case in ReferenceDataflowSource that if the referenceset name is ""mock"", then it returns the static ReferenceDataflowSource.mockInstance member (that the test would then have to set up, naturally, just like it calls setInstance today).

Integrability,"@davidbenjamin Sorry I've been out and just got around to looking at this. Given that this test appears to run just fine in the Java 11 job (which is not run on our docker), I suspect the failure may have something to do with the jar file we use to test on the docker (which is not the same jar we use on the non-docker tests). . I pulled your branch and all of the generation tasks (gatk doc, wdl gen, javadoc) seem to work fine, so given how much time it looks like this has taken up, I think it would make sense to either disable this test (on the docker only - see below - since we want it to still run in the other CI integration test job), or else remove the variantcalling package from the test package list (if thats the one thats causing the failure ?). And then create a ticket for me with whatever data you have, which I'll follow up on. If you restore everything to its natural state, you should be able to add this to the `DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest.documentationSmokeTest` method and then it will be skipped only when running on the docker:. ```; final DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest dt = new DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest();; if (dt.isGATKDockerContainer()) {; throw new SkipException(""See gatk issue #..."");; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1216668361:623,integrat,integration,623,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1216668361,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Integrability,"@davidbenjamin The bug here is that we misinterpreted what a TreeSet in java does. The actual behavior for this method was that it only took the FRIST variant at each start position that it saw from the ordering of the haplotypes it saw. This meant if a SNP and INDEL started at the same position then there was a chance that site only looks like a SNP to the subsequent trimming code and we trim incorrectly. . See the TreeSet docs:; ```; <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit; * comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if it is to; * correctly implement the {@code Set} interface. (See {@code Comparable}; * or {@code Comparator} for a precise definition of <i>consistent with; * equals</i>.) This is so because the {@code Set} interface is defined in; * terms of the {@code equals} operation, but a {@code TreeSet} instance; * performs all element comparisons using its {@code compareTo} (or; * {@code compare}) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method; * are, from the standpoint of the set, equal.

Integrability,"@davidbenjamin commented on [Thu Mar 31 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/432). Before integrating this with probabilistic segmentation, which is more complicated for somatic than for germline, we can simply replace the current tangent normalization step with the mode of the likelihood (as a function of copy ratio) resulting from the generative coverage model. This requires issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/429 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/430 to be completed. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Thu Mar 31 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/432#issuecomment-204015562). Also, this should only be attempted if we get good results from doing the equivalent in the germline code, issue https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/431.

Integrability,"@droazen - a proposal for that, which will be great for my toolkit too, is to make `GATKTool` params an argument collection which defaults to the ones in the tool now, but can be change in a tool-basis. For example, if I have a `VariantWalker` which does not use any read-source, disabling all params for reads will be nice for re-use the `VariantWalker` interface without allowing the user to pass something that it is not used at all. It is not enough to provide a way to require or not a source, but to completely remove from the command line the ability to get that argument. I guess that's what it is required also for the CNV tools (correct me if I am wrong, @samuelkle), to be able to change that behaviour and to being able to provide custom documentation/arguments (re-factor the reads input `-I` to be other kind of input).

Integrability,"@droazen @davidbenjamin any thoughts regarding the last bullet above in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471 on possible integration tests? Started looking at this today and was wondering if you might have any suggestions. Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool. I can document this process and then we can move on without committing any new tests or test files once we're satisfied that the exposure was done correctly. Or if you guys have additional suggestions, would be glad to hear them!. Finally, it looks like FilterAlignmentArtifacts doesn't have any integration tests for correctness---let me know if there are auxiliary tests we'd want to run there. Anyway, probably overthinking things, but the exposure was enough of a headache that I want to make sure I did it right.

This potential fix has already been implemented by the bcbio_nextgen guys, so I'm going to be testing that precisely (https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen/commit/336920a630d7f50b341eeeb4bad4ea6ab213f995).

Integrability,"@droazen I don't really have much of an opinion about the loggers. I think we chose log4j2 pretty arbitrarily and because it seemed popular. We don't have very complex logging needs so any logger pretty much satisfied our needs. . If there's a good reason to switch to SLF4J with a log4j backend that seems fine to me. It makes sense to use the more general solution so that people can use whatever backend they want. . I do know that we've encountered a lot of issues with having multiple copies of different logging frameworks included as transitive dependencies on spark. So there may be some hassle switching over, we'd have to run tests on google cloud to make sure we don't start crashing all of a sudden for logger related classpath issues. . @magicDGS I don't think anyone here cares that much about which logger we're using as long as it doesn't get in our way.

Integrability,"@droazen I'm not sure this is an improvement. We want the fundamental unit of spark tool to be the transform, not the cli wrapper around it. If we do this then we're pushing more of the contract of the transform outside of itself, i.e. see the newly duplicated bqsr code. I think that it was a deliberate decision to lift all reads into the initial rdd and then filter them in the transforms to what was needed by that transform. This is paying some performance cost in multi-stage pipelines which will potentially apply the same filters over and over again, but it simplifies the code because the filters can be baked into the transform and the pipeline writer doesn't have to think about them. It would be nice if we had a mechanism for adding metadata to an RDD so we can say ""this is a sorted RDD filtered with X,Y,and Z filters"", so we could intelligently avoid re-filtering.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1159#issuecomment-158168856:122,wrap,wrapper,122,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1159#issuecomment-158168856,2,"['contract', 'wrap']","['contract', 'wrapper']"

Integrability,"@droazen Thank you for the confirmation that HaplotypeCaller performs separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities, and that the code on line 729 of HaplotypeCallerEngine.java (method ```filterNonPassingReads()``` ) is indeed executing subsequent to the ```MappingQualityReadFilter```. May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality. And if you have a moment, could you please point me to the code that might be adversely affected by decreasing the low-end MAPQ threshold? I might have some ideas about that (or not!)...

Integrability,"@droazen any thoughts how we should proceed here, if at all? @ldgauthier reminded me that this story was unfinished and is getting a little stale. @fleharty take note if we want to report progress on this front to our MalariaGEN collaborators. On my end, there are a couple of things to do:; - [x] rebase and resolve conflicts; - [x] change TSV input as discussed above; - [x] add doc strings for new arguments; - [x] add integration tests to make absolutely sure exposure was done correctly, perhaps? I'm open to discussion about how this should be done. Complete coverage here will be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort, but I can probably put in a few tests that make sure changing the hard-coded values in master and doing the same via the exposed parameters in this branch have the same effect on a few existing test cases. However, while I'm doing the last three, I wonder if we could run whatever canonical evaluations/optimizations we have to see whether it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval.

I do see that GATK itself is using the newer version of log4j but then its the transitive dependencies for the libraries used that bring in the older version of log4j. . this creates situations that the final compiled jar has both version of the log4j and this could create problems. . Gatk being a very useful tool gets integrated in multiple other tools and pipelines so in a way affecting the security posture of where its being used. The risk might be low being a standalone cli tool but its a very hard conversation with info security :) . May I ask for a ballpark ETA for the new version? Appreciate the work thats gone into this tool.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8215#issuecomment-1448897264:164,depend,dependencies,164,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8215#issuecomment-1448897264,2,"['depend', 'integrat']","['dependencies', 'integrated']"
Integrability,"@droazen sure. This PR updates both `BucketUtils.getPathOnGcs` and `IOUtils.getPath` (the latter indirectly) to create a Google Cloud Storage filesystem with a default reopen set to 3. Anyone opening the given `Path` (or even a `Path` derived from it, e.g. via `subpath`) will have the retries enabled. `addPrefetcher` wraps an existing `Path`, so it inherits the underlying `Path`'s retry behavior. Classes within htsjdk that create a `Path` from a String, without using our utility code, would indeed not set retries and errors on those files would not get the benefit of our extra retry. The exception to that is the Spark code path with `NioBam`: this goes via `ReadsIterable`, which also sets the retries. My understanding is that the normal way to open BAMs for tools always creates the `Path` object when parsing the command line, as in e.g. `ReadInputArgumentCollection::GetReadIndexPaths()`. That code path that calls `IOUtils.getPath` (and thus sets the retries). I would expect that the added support for VCF follows the same style, though it looks like it doesn't. If there's a code path that I missed where you think we need retries then please let me know so I can add it!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2506#issuecomment-289585791:319,wrap,wraps,319,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2506#issuecomment-289585791,1,['wrap'],['wraps']

Integrability,"@droazen, if it's true we can merge the headers then I suppose that may be a possibility. I'm a little bit dubious, though, because one of the pieces of information is the reference index to reference name mapping, and I didn't think we required those to match. Or do we?. Keep in mind however that static variables aren't serialized, so we'd still have to include some fancy code to make sure that every worker has the header. And since workers may be added dynamically by Dataflow's auto-tuning, we may have to call that code at the beginning of every transform... just like addHeaders. . So we would have some ""action-at-a-distance"" type of code, with statics that may or may not have different values depending on which computer you're on. This sounds like it may be just as error-prone and headache-causing as the other approach. At this point I'm still leaning towards manually putting the headers back.

Integrability,"@heuermh Thanks for your input, we'll look into those options. I think the use case most of us are imagining is for narrow tables with ~1M-1B records or fewer (sometimes far fewer). For the CNV pipeline, Tribble support is a much higher priority than Hadoop integration, efficient compression, etc., and it's very unlikely we'll need to do out-of-core computations that won't be enabled by Tribble. However, that might not be true of more general use cases, so it's certainly worth investigating more robust formats. @SHuang-Broad For all current CNV use cases, we use separate columns for each annotation.

Integrability,"@jamesemery This is related to #6930 . The background is that PedigreeAnnotation is special-cased in GATK, which provides better command-line argument validation, and it will also be used to inject the PedigreeFile, create the SampleDB, etc. This is currently a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation, and therefore cant be used for GenotypeFieldAnnotation. There shouldnt be this limitation, and this PR tried to address that. The way I propose to do this is to make InfoFieldAnnotation and GenotypeAnnotation into interfaces, with default methods where possible. The existing subclasses all switch from extending them to implementing them. This is generally a trivial difference, but it touches a lot of classes. . All existing classes that previously extended PedigreeAnnotation (formerly a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation), now extend PedigreeAnnotation and implement InfoFieldAnnotation. This is a minimal difference, but it makes it possible for future classes to extend PedigreeAnnotation, and then implement GenotypeAnnotation. The only part this includes that I didnt like was the fact that the existing InfoFieldAnnotation overrides toString(), which I cant do in an interface. So I created AbstractInfoFieldAnnotation, and all existing InfoFieldAnnotation classes extend that. It's not currently clear to me how critical that override of toString() is. The weakness of this PR is that classes outside the GATK project that currently extend InfoFieldAnnotation would not inherit this.

Integrability,"@jamesemery sorry to bug on this topic, but I'm hoping to make a push early this year to fully migrate my lab off GATK3 . I looked more closely at the specific annotations we need to migrate. I decided that I will implement our walker, 'DiscvrVariantAnnotator', which is basically a light wrapper around VariantAnnotation. This will make it easier to spike in custom annotations. In that walker, I will override makeVariantAnnotations(). I will make a new marker interface for EngineAwareAnnotation, and test that on all the Annotation classes, and use this to inject FeatureManager. So no core GATK changes needed. I did find one thing I'd like to propose. You probably know PedigreeAnnotation is special-cased in GATK. Annotations that use it have automatic argument validation and have the SampleDB injected. Currently, PedigreeAnnotation is a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation, so isnt available to GenotypeAnnotations. There doesnt appear to be a solid reason why. I tried to fix that and my best idea is the proposal here: #7041 . The core idea is to convert InfoFieldAnnotation and GenotypeAnnotation to interfaces. This is generally a trivial switch in existing code. With that, it becomes possible for classes that currently extend PedigreeAnnotation (which I switched to no longer extend InfoFieldAnnotation) to simply PedigreeAnnotation and implement InfoFieldAnnotation.

Integrability,"@jfarrell Do you recognize ""scc"" as a local host name ?

Since you didn't include one as part of the hdfs path on the command line, it looks like transform along the way resulted in one being added (the authority component looks like ""host:port""), resulting in the port number -1. So I'm not clear if its a configuration issue, or a bad code code path, or both. But I would suggest trying an hdfs path with a valid authority component (one that works with the hadoop shell). @SHuang-Broad I do see some code paths in `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` that call `Paths.get directly`, rather than `IOUtils.getPath()`.

Integrability,"@jjfarrell You don't need splitting index for cram. The index works around a bam specific problem which makes it hard to find good split points in the file. Cram is designed in a way that makes it easier to find the split points so the index is unnecessary. . I don't have good numbers for how long it takes to find the split points for bam. It depends on your filesystem. If you have a low latency file system like a local disk or hdfs setup than finding split points takes very little time (~seconds), but if you have a high latency file system like something backed by google object store then finding split points may take a long time (on the order of minutes to tens of minutes depending on latency and file size).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4506#issuecomment-371224015:345,depend,depends,345,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4506#issuecomment-371224015,2,['depend'],"['depending', 'depends']"

Integrability,"@jonn-smith @LeeTL1220 @droazen Thanks for sharing the information above, and I looked at it. It seems to me that once we have a chain file for one reference and another reference, the remaining steps are straightforward. I also noticed the following Picard utility [Picard LiftoverVcf]( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#LiftoverVcf ) that can Lift over a VCF file from one reference to another. ; Therefore, creating the chain file between a pair of references (and limiting ourselves to cases where both references are from the same species, mouse/human) is the key. To that end, according to the following post [List of chain file creators](https://www.biostars.org/p/65558/) most of the chain file creation tools are available as a web interface. However, the UCSC one seems to be more popular, and fortunately, they have the utilities as open source and to some degree explain their steps in the [LiverOver_Howto](http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/LiftOver_Howto) link you sent. With this approach, they first BLAT the pairwise contigs in the reference files and then use the utility DoSameSpeciesLiftOver.pl. . Based on this, it appears to me I should think about the following steps:; a) First, try out their code (UCSC) and make sure it works to produce chain files for two references successfully.; b) Design/propose a solution putting the logic in DoSameSpeciesLiftOver.pl into GATK, which also might need a BLAT run .

The test in the PR was super useful as a temporary test, but as you mentioned it runs pretty slowly, and as it stands the test passes on current master anyway.

Also, the user who originally reported the issue was using 11k intervals, and it seems that the stack overflow fix is unlikely to help in that case. Is there any guidance for users on what is a reasonable number of intervals per process ? It sounds like the intention was that it be used with pretty small intervals.

Integrability,"@laserson the `SAMRecord` vs. Google `Read` is a loooooong story.; The super-short version:; We had a bunch of utilities written for `SAMRecord` that @droazen refactored over months to take the GATKRead interface. As it happens, the SAM spec and the GA4GH spec are not 100% compatible. So, it's not possible to losslessly convert from A -> B -> A (where A is `SAMRecord` or Google `Read`). The cases where it doesn't work are edge cases, but they exist. Second, @jean-philippe-martin found that converting to Google `Read` was fairly expensive. Between those two points, I think we're probably better off with SAM-backed reads. (Also, right now the Google `Read` is serialized via JSON, so it's not that small anyway.). @tomwhite and @jean-philippe-martin, I think adding the header back will be fine for us engineers working on the engine, but it will make for a poorer user experience for newcomers and Comp Bios to burden them with having to care about what happens with shuffles (when they just want to prototype something). . That said, I think this is probably the best approach we have at our disposal. If we do, we need to do an excellent job of throwing errors if users try to perform actions that would require the header. The error message should explain what really happened and ideally point to some documentation we write explaining the stripping of the header and how to fix it.

Integrability,"@lbergelson I added the ClassLoader fallback code in to `GATKPathSpecifier`.

So I updated the tests to use `GATKPathSpecifier` (they all passed), then integrated the fallback code and changed 3 negative tests that went from FileSystemNotFoundException to ProviderNotFoundException.

Integrability,"@lbergelson Sorry to be unclear---this isn't a GATK issue. For Cromwell, you can configure various options for each backend. For example, if you are running on a local backend with Docker, you can set a `submit-docker` attribute to specify the string that runs the Docker container; so to solve the above problem, you'd set this to include `--shm-size` and set it accordingly. However, according to @jsotobroad, you're not allowed such an attribute when submitting to Google cloud. If that's the case, then this is more of an issue with the Cromwell/Google Pipelines interface than the data.table package (although, as the discussion in the GitHub issue above shows, it'd be a simple fix on the data.table end, so I'm not sure why it's not addressed yet...) Changing the R script to get around the issue in this particular case is not unacceptably ugly, but you could imagine we might run into a similar problem in the future if anything else exceeds the 64MB /dev/shm limit and also cannot specify tmpfs.

Regarding the `Main` class, because you point it out here, I would like to have some control over `Main` and how it manages things like errors or logging header. Basically all the things that I'm facing at the moment are, apart of this error using the testing framework, is that the framework have tons of mentions to the GATK itself (error messages pointing to the GATK manual page or bundle tools), and little control over which of them should be expose to the final user.

Integrability,"@lbergelson, just want to discuss some issues here-. 1. We currently have to use `--avoid-nio` with `--sample-name-map` and `--bypass-feature-reader` to get `GenomicsDBImport` to work with azure URIs. Why don't we just merge the `--avoid-nio` functionality with `--bypass-feauture-reader`, that is allow GenomicsDB to process the URIs by default?; 2. Noticed that the only way to use azure URIs for vcf names is by using `--sample-name-map`. Directly specifying vcfs with the `-V` option is not possible because `--avoid-nio` cannot be used in conjunction. Should this be supported?; 3. @lbergelson, w.r.t malformed Azure URIs, GenomicsDB does put out an error -; ```; 11:10:12.658 error NativeGenomicsDB - pid=30608 tid=2980282 htslib_plugin could not open file az://genomicsdb@oda/vcfs/t0.vcf.gz [TileDB::StorageManagerConfig] Error: Azure Storage Blob initialization failed for home=az://genomicsdb@container/vcfs/sample.vcf.gz; ; Azure Blob URI does not seem to have either an account or a container: Protocol error; [E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file ""az://genomicsdb@container/vcfs/sample.vcf.gz"" : Input/output error; ```; Is this not sufficient?

Integrability,"@ldgauthier @yfarjoun We have an update on this! We've identified the bug:. * When `AbstractFeatureReader.getFeatureReader()` tries to open a `.vcf.gz` that doesn't have an index, it returns a `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` instead of a `TabixFeatureReader`, because `methods.isTabix()` returns false when an index is not present.; * `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader`, in turn, opens a Java vanilla `GZIPInputStream`, instead of the `BlockCompressedInputStream` that gets opened when you create a `TabixFeatureReader`.; * `GZIPInputStream`, in turn, has a *confirmed bug* filed against it in Oracle's bug tracker (see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7036144#), that it inappropriately relies on the `available()` method to detect end-of-file, which is never safe to do given the contract of `available()`; * As the final piece in the ghastly puzzle, implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk do not implement `available()` at all, instead using the default implementation which always returns 0. As a result of this combination of bugs in Java's `GZIPInputStream` itself and bugs in htsjdk's `SeekableStream` classes, end-of-file can be detected prematurely when within 26 bytes of the end of a block, due to the following code in `GZIPInputStream.readTrailer()`:. ```; if (this.in.available() > 0 || n > 26) {; ....; }; return true; // EOF; ```. Where `n` is the number of bytes left to inflate in the current block. The solution is to replace all usages of the bugged `GZIPInputStream` with `BlockCompressedInputStream` in tribble in htsjdk (at least, for points in the code where the input is known to be block-gzipped rather than regular gzipped). For due diligence we should also implement `available()` correctly for all implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4224#issuecomment-360282461:795,contract,contract,795,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4224#issuecomment-360282461,1,['contract'],['contract']

That may be overkill in the long run but for now gives us a base environment for running integration tests on Travis. The environment managers I've looked at (conda and virtualenv) both appear to work by activating a shell environment. Ideally, we wouldn't need an intermediate shell between the Java code and the Python code, but thats still TBD.

Integrability,"@lucidtronix Based on the response we got from Intel, I tried upgrading to TF 1.15, but there are a cascade of downstream issues.

Integrability,"@magicDGS . I am afraid this is not easy. I didn't write the binding (@tedsharpe did), but I would asseme the limitation comes from bwa mem itself, not the binding, as the binding is a thin wrapper that delegates the loading of the index files (or the image that combines all 5 index files in this case) to bwa. . The SV team here have a script (`scripts/sv/default_init.sh`) that when the Spark cluster is created and initialized, the image file is distributed to all walker nodes. Spark clusters other than Google's Dataproc would probably allow you to provide scripts as initialization actions as well. On the other hand, there seem to be a `--files` argument that you can append to your cmd line arguments which yarn will parse and distribute the provided local file to all nodes, though in this case it will be very inefficient considering the image file's size.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3186#issuecomment-312362074:190,wrap,wrapper,190,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3186#issuecomment-312362074,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']
Integrability,"@magicDGS A method like this should probably go into the base CommandLinePluginDescriptor class in Barclay first. . Having said that, I'm going to close this issue here, since I've recently added a new method in Barclay called [getDefaultInstances](https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/blob/976fafea23216cf0577b8e3fe635b115c7975a76/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/barclay/argparser/CommandLinePluginDescriptor.java#L170) (not available until GATK upgrades, which I think will be soon). That, in combination with getAllInstances, might be sufficient for what you need. If not, please propose the new method in Barclay (or reopen this one here if I'm missing something). Either way, I think your original point about getAllInstances is valid, since the name doesn't reflect the contract, but for that I think we should just change the name of it in Barclay to something like ""getUserInstances"" to reflects what it actually does.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2362#issuecomment-275688356:782,contract,contract,782,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2362#issuecomment-275688356,1,['contract'],['contract']
Integrability,"@magicDGS After much thought I believe that the code we discussed belongs in your code, not in the GATK. Here's an outline of some static methods that should meet your needs:. ``` java; public class DGSUtils {; @FunctionalInterface; private interface LikelihoodFunction {; double apply(final Allele allele, final GATKRead read);; }. private static Allele createAllele(final PileupElement e, final byte refBase, final Allele refAllele) {; return e.isDeletion() ? Allele.SPAN_DEL : (e.getBase() == refBase ? refAllele : Allele.create(e.getBase()));; }. public static ReadLikelihoods<Allele> likelihoodsFromPileup(final ReadPileup pileup,; final Allele refAllele,; final SAMFileHeader header) {; final Map<String, List<GATKRead>> readsBySample = pileup.getReads().stream(); .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(read -> ReadUtils.getSampleName(read, header)));. final byte refBase = refAllele.getBases()[0];; final Set<Allele> alleleSet = new TreeSet<>();; pileup.forEach(e -> alleleSet.add(createAllele(e, refBase, refAllele)));. return new ReadLikelihoods<>(new IndexedSampleList(readsBySample.keySet()), new IndexedAlleleList<>(alleleSet), readsBySample);. }. public static void setLikelihoods(final ReadLikelihoods<Allele> likelihoods, final LikelihoodFunction likelihoodFunction) {; final int numAlleles = likelihoods.numberOfAlleles();; for (int sample = 0; sample < likelihoods.numberOfSamples(); sample++) {; final LikelihoodMatrix<Allele> matrix = likelihoods.sampleMatrix(sample);; final int numReads = matrix.numberOfReads();; for (int alleleIndex = 0; alleleIndex < numAlleles; alleleIndex++) {; final Allele allele = likelihoods.getAllele(alleleIndex);; for (int readIndex = 0; readIndex < numReads; readIndex++) {; final GATKRead read = matrix.getRead(readIndex);; matrix.set(alleleIndex, readIndex, likelihoodFunction.apply(allele, read));; }; }; }; }; }; ```.
