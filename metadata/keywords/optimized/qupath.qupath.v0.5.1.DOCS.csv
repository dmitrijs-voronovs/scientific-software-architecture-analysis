Caveats:; * This is the current status: toolchains weren't used (much) before QuPath v0.4; * Gradle can be a bit picky when using Java versions that are 'too recent'. This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * More detailed building instructions are [in the QuPath docs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html); * Packages and installers are created using [`jpackage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) via the [Badass Runtime Plugin](https://badass-runtime-plugin.beryx.org/releases/latest/); * e.g. `gradlew clean build test jpackage`. ### GitHub Actions. * QuPath is built for Windows, Ubuntu & macOS (Intel) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:2424,down,downloaded,2424,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['down'],['downloaded']

The inclusion of all-new OpenSlide builds has enabled us to include better support for Apple Silicon. This means that *almost everything* in QuPath should now work on recent M1/M2 Macs. ; The only exception is that Bio-Formats does not support Apple Silicon for a subset of file formats, specifically; * Images with JPEG-XR compression; * The includes most CZI whole slide images from Zeiss; * Images that use libjpeg-turbo; * This includes NDPI files - but most of these can be read with OpenSlide anyway. Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md:9818,down,download,9818,CHANGELOG.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md,1,['down'],['download']

Caveats:; * This is the current status: toolchains weren't used (much) before QuPath v0.4; * Gradle can be a bit picky when using Java versions that are 'too recent'. This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * More detailed building instructions are [in the QuPath docs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html); * Packages and installers are created using [`jpackage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:2045,avail,available,2045,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the; GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to; any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to; your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not; price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you; have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for; them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you; want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new; free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future. After v0.5, QuPath will require macOS 11 or later to run on Mac.

Deployability,"e Silicon support. The inclusion of all-new OpenSlide builds has enabled us to include better support for Apple Silicon. This means that *almost everything* in QuPath should now work on recent M1/M2 Macs. ; The only exception is that Bio-Formats does not support Apple Silicon for a subset of file formats, specifically; * Images with JPEG-XR compression; * The includes most CZI whole slide images from Zeiss; * Images that use libjpeg-turbo; * This includes NDPI files - but most of these can be read with OpenSlide anyway. Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future.

Deployability,"hains.html) separate the Java version needed to run Gradle from the version needed to run QuPath; * It *should* be possible to use any JDK > 8 to do either of the following; * Build with `gradlew clean build`; * Run with `gradlew run`; * The Java version QuPath actually needs will either be discovered or downloaded at build time. Caveats:; * This is the current status: toolchains weren't used (much) before QuPath v0.4; * Gradle can be a bit picky when using Java versions that are 'too recent'. This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * More detailed building instructions are [in the QuPath docs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html); * Packages and installers are created using [`jpackage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) via the [Badass Runtime Plugin](https://badass-runtime-plugin.beryx.org/releases/latest/); * e.g. `gradlew clean build test jpackage`. ### GitHub Actions. * QuPath is built for Windows, Ubuntu & macOS (Intel) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/actions); * The important workflows are defined at [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/main/.github/workflows); * Ideally QuPath would also be built for macOS using Apple Silicon... but alas that isn't currently supported (see [a lengthy discussion among frustrated people here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2187)). ; ### Java version. * **QuPath v0.2 - v0.4** target **Java 11** for source code compatibility; * Compatibility is checked via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/main/.github/workflows/gradle.yml); * Because `jpackage` was only added in Java 14 and stabilized in Java 16, a later JDK can be required to build packages - and the Gradle build scripts for those releases may only work with that JDK; * **QuPath v0.4** is intended to be built ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:3109,release,releases,3109,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['release'],['releases']

Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future. After v0.5, QuPath will require macOS 11 or later to run on Mac.

Deployability,"les should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPath is properly modularized, the docs should be reorganized by module; * All `public` and `protected` classes, methods and fields should have doc comments and list all parameters; * It isn't essential to explain what `return` returns unless it's very surprising; * Use annotations as appropriate; * `@since` annotations should be added for new methods (although it's easy to forget...); * `@deprecated` annotations should be added for regrettable old methods for at least one release before the methods are removed. ### Saving & loading. * When something needs to be persistent, try to avoid Java serialization; * Serialization is currently used for `.qpdata` files, but ultimately this should be removed; * Prefer JSON to other kinds of serialization; * Thinking *'could I read this in Python if I wanted to?'* can be a good guide when choosing a format; * Use `qupath.lib.io.GsonTools` to help; * Keep forwards and backwards compatibility in mind... serialization is hard; * Use UTF-8 encoding consistently with text files; * This should be the default from Java 18 - but best specify just in case. ### Scripting. * QuPath's default scripting language is Groovy; * When adding new processing commands, these should be scriptable as far as possible; * This means adding a command [to the workflow](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/scripting/workflows.html); * Ensuring scriptability is one of the least fun bits of adding anything new...",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:10356,release,release,10356,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['release'],['release']

QuPath is being developed at the University of Edinburgh.; One way to contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use.

The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier).

This is a *minor release* that aims to be fully compatible with v0.2.0 while fixing numerous bugs. The most significant change is to fix the behavior of 'Resolve hierarchy' in the specific case where it is called for a TMA image; see https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/540 for more details if this might affect you. Full list of bugs fixed:; * 'Resolve hierarchy' does not work correctly for images containing both detections and TMA cores (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/540); * Points tool does not support z-stacks/time series (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/526); * Point annotations cannot be merged; attempting to merge objects across z-slices throws an exception; * Error thrown when right-clicking a points annotation in the counting dialog; * Inconsistent pixel classifier behavior when switching between known/unknown pixel sizes (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/531); * Cannot load a project if no classes.json is found (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/510); * Unable to correctly im,MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md:54736,release,release,54736,CHANGELOG.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md,1,['release'],['release']

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for; software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed; to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,; the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to; share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free; software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the; GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to; any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to; your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not; price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you; have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for; them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you; want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new; free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you; these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have; certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if; you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether; gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same; freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive; or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they; know their rights.

To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work; in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an; exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the; earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based; on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without; permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for; infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a; computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,; distribution (with or without modification), making available to the; public, and in some countries other activities as well.

Integrability," * **QuPath v0.1.2** and earlier were built with **Java 8** (and `javapackager`)... and an altogether different and more complicated process; * QuPath v0.5 is *likely* to target Java 17 source code compatibility to use new language features. ## Developing QuPath. ### Basic structure. * QuPath's code at https://github.com/qupath/qupath comprises several jar files; * Two core jars (with no dependency on JavaFX or the UI); * `qupath-core` for the most essential stuff & data structures; * `qupath-core-processing` for extra code related to image processing; * A UI jar (which *does* require JavaFX); * `qupath-gui-fx` depends upon the two core jars; * An app jar; * `qupath-app`, which brings everything together and adds command line scripting support; * Extension jars, including; * `ImageServer` extensions, to add support for image types; * General extensions, to add support for anything & everything else; * Extensions are all optional; QuPath should be able to launch without them. ### Core dependencies. * QuPath's jars have some other third-party dependencies; * The main ones & their versions are stored in a [Gradle version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) stored at [`gradle/libs.versions/toml`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml); * We try to avoid having too many dependencies, especially for core jars, and prefer permissive open licenses; * Dependencies that use native libraries are tricky, since QuPath should work on all platforms - including Windows (64-bit), Linux (at least Ubuntu) and macOS; * [JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) helps deal with this for OpenCV (and some other optional dependencies); * Any future Apple Silicon distribution would require **all** native library dependencies to be built for Apple Silicon. ### Modularity. * Although the jars are (kind of) modules, QuPath does **not** currently use the [**Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**](https://en.wikipedia",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:5256,depend,dependencies,5256,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability," * Supports additional measurements (including max/min diameters, solidity); * New preference to optionally invert the orientation of the z-position slide for z-stacks; * Improved 'Measurement manager' to remove some or all measurements from objects of any type; * Show ID in tooltip for project entries (makes it easier to find the data directory); * Other bug fixes, including:; * Local normalization now applied before calculating other features (was applied after in m11); * Show only 'Num detections' if there are detections anywhere in the image; * Fixed bug in 'Simplify shape' to handle polygons and rectangles properly; * Fixed bug in command bar display when toggling the analysis pane visibility; * Fixed bug where the RNG seed was not set before training classifiers; * Fixed bug in 'Create combined training image' that failed to handle unclassified annotations; * Projects are automatically saved after changing the image name (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/465); * Bump dependencies ImageJ, Bio-Formats, JUnit, picocli. -----. ## Version 0.2.0-m11. This is a *milestone* (i.e. still in development) version made available to try out new features early. * Introduced 'ImageOp' and 'ImageDataOp' as a flexible way to chain processing steps; * Rewrote most of the pixel classification; * Now much simpler and more maintainable (using Ops); * Supports color deconvolution; * Faster (possibly); * New-style object classifiers support command logging/scripting; * Added 'Import images from v0.1.2' command to recover data from old projects; * Added groovy-xml as a dependency (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/455); * Fixed bugs; * Save & Save As are swapped (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/451); * Reinstate adding images to projects via drag & drop (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/450); * Fixed specifying z-slices/timepoints with OME-TIFF export (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/453); * Improved user notification when loading a broken extension ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md:63300,depend,dependencies,63300,CHANGELOG.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

This page contains assorted notes written mostly for software developers with an interest in QuPath.; It describes some (potentially) useful things to know if you want to . 1. Contribute to QuPath; 2. Create a QuPath extension; 3. Use QuPath as a dependency. ## Licensing matters. ### QuPath's license. * QuPath is released under the GNU General Public License v3 (or later); * Copyright notices should be included with distributions, the GitHub repo, and in all source files; * The original GPL licensing decision was made at Queen's University Belfast (where @petebankhead first developed QuPath & worked until the end of 2016); * QuPath is now developed primarily at the University of Edinburgh & lots of it has been rewritten - however much of the original legacy code remains. Since the recent stuff is still all based on the original GPL code, QuPath remains under the GPL.; * For more info about what this means, see [Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html). ### Dependencies. * All dependencies **must** be compatible with the GPL; * Care must be taken to give attribution and adhere to all dependency requirements (e.g. including copyright notices); * Code with incompatible restrictions (e.g. non-commercial use only) can't be incorporated into QuPath; * See [Various Licenses and Comments about Them](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) for more details and info about license compatibility. ### New code. * New code developed from scratch (and not derived from existing GPL'ed code) should be under a GPL-compatible license; * Using a permissive open-source license (e.g. MIT, Apache) is usually preferred, so as to; 1. maximize reuse, including potential interoperability with commercial systems; 2. meet the requirements of some funders. ## Building QuPath. ### Gradle. * QuPath is built using [The Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and y",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:279,depend,dependency,279,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['depend'],['dependency']

This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * More detailed building instructions are [in the QuPath docs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html); * Packages and installers are created using [`jpackage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) via the [Badass Runtime Plugin](https://badass-runtime-plugin.beryx.org/releases/latest/); * e.g. `gradlew clean build test jpackage`. ### GitHub Actions. * QuPath is built for Windows, Ubuntu & macOS (Intel) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/actions); * The important workflows are defined at [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/main/.github/workflows); * Ideally QuPath would also be built for macOS using Apple Silicon... but alas that isn't currently supported (see [a lengthy discussion among frustrated people here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2187)). ; ### Java version. * **QuPath v0.2 - v0.4** target **Java 11** for sourc",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:2716,wrap,wrapper,2716,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

This is a **major update**, with many enhancements and new features. > **Important!** Some older extensions will need to be updated to work with QuPath v0.5. ### Enhancements. #### User interface; * New toolbar badges & context help; * Click the `?` icon in the toolbar to view the help; * Find tips or warnings to help avoid common errors; * Major upgrade to the brightness/contrast/channels command, including; * Save/restore display settings in projects; * Import display settings by drag & drop; * Optionally view log counts for channel histograms; * For multi-channel (non-RGB images):; * Better support to toggle channels on/off; * Remember previous selection when switching between grayscale & color; * More quickly change channel colors (the square icon is now a color picker); * Better support for viewing multiple images simultaneously; * New 'Grid size' commands to quickly create a grid of viewers; * Optionally synchronize display settings across images; * Optionally 'detach' a viewer to see it in a separate window; * 'Synchronize viewers' is now a persistent preference, which is turned *off* by default; * *'Zoom to fit'* is now a regular button, not a persistent toggle button; * Clicking 'Zoom to fit' updates the current viewer, but doesn't 'lock' its status to block panning/zooming further; * Completely new log viewer to access more logging information; * Find the code at https://github.com/qupath/log-viewer; * Includes badge to highlight errors that have occurred when the log viewer is closed; * Information about the logger class & thread; * New extension manager to add, remove & update extensions; * New toolbar buttons for the script editor `</>`, log viewer, fill/unfill annotations; * *File → Export snapshots* supports PNG, JPEG and TIFF (not just PNG); * New",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md:1802,interface,interface,1802,CHANGELOG.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md,2,"['interface', 'synchroniz']","['interface', 'synchronize']"

Use QuPath as a dependency. ## Licensing matters. ### QuPath's license. * QuPath is released under the GNU General Public License v3 (or later); * Copyright notices should be included with distributions, the GitHub repo, and in all source files; * The original GPL licensing decision was made at Queen's University Belfast (where @petebankhead first developed QuPath & worked until the end of 2016); * QuPath is now developed primarily at the University of Edinburgh & lots of it has been rewritten - however much of the original legacy code remains. Since the recent stuff is still all based on the original GPL code, QuPath remains under the GPL.; * For more info about what this means, see [Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html). ### Dependencies. * All dependencies **must** be compatible with the GPL; * Care must be taken to give attribution and adhere to all dependency requirements (e.g. including copyright notices); * Code with incompatible restrictions (e.g. non-commercial use only) can't be incorporated into QuPath; * See [Various Licenses and Comments about Them](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) for more details and info about license compatibility. ### New code. * New code developed from scratch (and not derived from existing GPL'ed code) should be under a GPL-compatible license; * Using a permissive open-source license (e.g. MIT, Apache) is usually preferred, so as to; 1. maximize reuse, including potential interoperability with commercial systems; 2. meet the requirements of some funders. ## Building QuPath. ### Gradle. * QuPath is built using [The Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and you'll need a **Java Development Kit (JDK)** available; * [Toolchains](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) separate the J",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:1079,depend,dependencies,1079,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,2,['depend'],"['dependencies', 'dependency']"

Integrability,"ers/); * Care should be taken when adding new code or dependencies to make sure they will fit into a more modularized QuPath world (e.g. avoid splitting packages across jars). ### IDEs. * QuPath is currently developed using [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org); * See instructions at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html#running-from-an-ide; * While it may be tempting to use another IDE (e.g. IntelliJ), I've found it very difficult to set this up smoothly... once we've embraced the [Java Platform Module System](#modularity) this will hopefully improve. ### Testing. * QuPath has some tests using JUnit, which are run automatically when building; * We need more tests!; * New code should be tested where possible!. ## QuPath as a dependency. * Core and UI jars are published to SciJava Maven; * Releases: `https://maven.scijava.org/content/repositories/releases`; * Snapshots: `https://maven.scijava.org/content/repositories/snapshots`; * Extensions aren't currently published, because they aren't expected to be used as dependencies... although this may change; * Pay attention to any [licensing considerations since QuPath is under the GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#NFUseGPLPlugins). ## QuPath extensions. * Where possible, create extensions rather than modify QuPath's core code; * Extensions are easier to update (usually just a single jar file); * Changes to the core can cause compatibility complications; * It's usually easiest to create a new extension by modifying an existing one; * See https://github.com/qupath for examples (with `qupath-extension` in the repo name); * Pay attention to any [licensing considerations for your extension](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndPlugins). ## Coding in QuPath. ### Versioning. * QuPath uses semantic versioning, but hasn't yet reached 1.x.x; * See https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/versions.html; * The API shouldn't change significantly for any 0.x.X release;",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:7564,depend,dependencies,7564,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Since the recent stuff is still all based on the original GPL code, QuPath remains under the GPL.; * For more info about what this means, see [Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html). ### Dependencies. * All dependencies **must** be compatible with the GPL; * Care must be taken to give attribution and adhere to all dependency requirements (e.g. including copyright notices); * Code with incompatible restrictions (e.g. non-commercial use only) can't be incorporated into QuPath; * See [Various Licenses and Comments about Them](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) for more details and info about license compatibility. ### New code. * New code developed from scratch (and not derived from existing GPL'ed code) should be under a GPL-compatible license; * Using a permissive open-source license (e.g. MIT, Apache) is usually preferred, so as to; 1. maximize reuse, including potential interoperability with commercial systems; 2. meet the requirements of some funders. ## Building QuPath. ### Gradle. * QuPath is built using [The Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and you'll need a **Java Development Kit (JDK)** available; * [Toolchains](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) separate the Java version needed to run Gradle from the version needed to run QuPath; * It *should* be possible to use any JDK > 8 to do either of the following; * Build with `gradlew clean build`; * Run with `gradlew run`; * The Java version QuPath actually needs will either be discovered or downloaded at build time. Caveats:; * This is the current status: toolchains weren't used (much) before QuPath v0.4; * Gradle can be a bit picky when using Java versions that are 'too recent'. This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:1772,interoperab,interoperability,1772,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['interoperab'],['interoperability']

Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues).

We use GitHub to track the stuff we're working on (or urgently *should* be working on) & want to avoid becoming overwhelmed by discussions & requests that might not be a good fit for the project. For that reason, feature requests added here that aren't agreed with a core developer - or don't follow the template below - will usually be closed quickly. . If in doubt, use [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). This helps us keep things organized & also means more people can contribute to the discussion. ## Feature request. **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**; A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]. **Describe the solution you'd like**; A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. **Describe alternatives you've considered**; A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. **Additional context**; Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md:88,enhance,enhancement,88,.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md,1,['enhance'],['enhancement']

Modifiability,"Twitter, be sure to [@QuPath](https://twitter.com/qupath). ### Suggesting enhancements. The [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) is also a good place to suggest enhancements to QuPath. Particularly worthy suggestions may be added as [issues](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues) - but please be aware that there is a _long_ backlog of enhancement planned already. The main limiting factor is time. Which leads on to... ### Working together. QuPath is being developed at the University of Edinburgh.; One way to contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum]",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md:3900,extend,extend,3900,CONTRIBUTING.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md,1,['extend'],['extend']

Caveats:; * This is the current status: toolchains weren't used (much) before QuPath v0.4; * Gradle can be a bit picky when using Java versions that are 'too recent'.

Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress.

Now a prompt should appear, elegantly asking for the new image path.; * Locale information now stored in .qpdata files. This (hopefully) fixed a critical bug affecting computers where the locale used commas to separate decimal values (i.e. #,### rather than #.###), which previously prevented QuPath from reopening saved data files.; * Installer now requests a Desktop shortcut to be created by default. -----. ## Version 0.0.4. * Added check for updates on QuPath startup; * Made pre-release notice less obtrusive; * Added 'Measure -> Show measurement manager' command to enable measurements to be viewed & (optionally) removed; * Added 'File -> Revert' command to go back to the last saved version for the current image data; * Added new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command. This will eventually replace the Haralick features command (and possibly others), since it offers the same functionality in a much more flexible way. Furthermore, the new command can handle up to 8 channels of fluorescence data (with arbitrary setting of the min/max values used to calculate the graylevel co-occurrence matrix).; * Major updates to the 'Add Delaunay cluster features (experimental)' command, with improved display and ability to save connections within the ImageData properties.; * Major updates to the 'TMA data viewer', with improved performance and a tree-table structure.; * Improved 'Tile classifications to annotations' command to support tile-based region identification; * Improved 'Simple tissue detection' command with support for detecting tissue inside TMACoreObjects; * Improved TMA dearrayer speed & accuracy; * TMA core labels can now optionally have leading zeros (e.g. 01-16), or be in descending order (e.g. J-A); * TMA grids can be applied to add TMA 'Unique ID' values by drag-and-drop, using a text file with extension '.qpmap'; * Addin",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md:88986,flexible,flexible,88986,CHANGELOG.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CHANGELOG.md,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

This is a *milestone* (i.e. still in development) version made available to try out new features early. * Introduced 'ImageOp' and 'ImageDataOp' as a flexible way to chain processing steps; * Rewrote most of the pixel classification; * Now much simpler and more maintainable (using Ops); * Supports color deconvolution; * Faster (possibly); * New-style object classifiers support command logging/scripting; * Added 'Import images from v0.1.2' command to recover data from old projects; * Added groovy-xml as a dependency (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/455); * Fixed bugs; * Save & Save As are swapped (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/451); * Reinstate adding images to projects via drag & drop (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/450); * Fixed specifying z-slices/timepoints with OME-TIFF export (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/453); * Improved user notification when loading a broken extension (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/454). -----. ## Version 0.2.0-m10.

The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md:3261,enhance,enhancement,3261,CONTRIBUTING.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md,1,['enhance'],['enhancement']

Changes frequently break scripts... and thereby annoy users; * It's preferable to break a script completely rather than subtly change its behavior (since no results flag a problem, while wrong results can slip through unnoticed). ### Code style. * The best guide is usually to ensure new code looks much like the existing code; * Use standard Java conventions, e.g. `CamelCase` with a capital letter at the start of a class name and small letter for variable or method; * [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) is used to enforce some style rules; * These are currently fairly minimal... but might increase over time; * The 'correct' [modifier order](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_modifier.html#ModifierOrder) should be used; * Test source files should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPath is properly modularized, the docs should be reorganized by module; * All `public` and `protected` classes, methods and fields sho",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:9028,variab,variable,9028,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

If you cannot; distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this; License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you; may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent; license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by; all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then; the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to; refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under; any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to; apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other; circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any; patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any; such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the; integrity of the free software distribution system, which is; implemented by public license practices. Many people have made; generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed; through that system in reliance on consistent application of that; system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing; to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot; impose that choice.

A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any; tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,; or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation; into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,; doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular; product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a; typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status; of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user; actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product; is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial; commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent; the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,; procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install; and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from; a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must; suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object; code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because; modification has been made.

You must make sure that they, too, receive; or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they; know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:; (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License; giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains; that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and; authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as; changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to; authors of previous versions.

Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future. After v0.5, QuPath will require macOS 11 or later to run on Mac. This is because of recent changes in JavaFX - for more details, see [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/doc-files/release-notes-21.md#javafx-requires-macos-11-or-later) and [here](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8308114). #### Startup may be slower.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.; States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of; software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to; avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could; make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that; patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and; modification follow.

Testability," Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you; have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for; them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you; want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new; free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you; these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have; certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if; you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether; gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same; freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive; or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they; know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:; (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License; giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains; that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and; authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as; changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to; authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run; modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer; can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of; protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic; pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to; use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

This means that if you're trying to build an old QuPath release, you might need to call the Gradle wrapper using a Java version that was around at the time; * More detailed building instructions are [in the QuPath docs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html); * Packages and installers are created using [`jpackage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) via the [Badass Runtime Plugin](https://badass-runtime-plugin.beryx.org/releases/latest/); * e.g. `gradlew clean build test jpackage`. ### GitHub Actions. * QuPath is built for Windows, Ubuntu & macOS (Intel) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/actions); * The important workflows are defined at [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/main/.github/workflows); * Ideally QuPath would also be built for macOS using Apple Silicon... but alas that isn't currently supported (see [a lengthy discussion among frustrated people here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2187)). ; ### Java version. * **QuPath v0.2 - v0.4** target **Java 11** for source code compatibility; * Compatibility is checked via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/main/.github/workflows/gradle.yml); * Because `jpackage` was only added in Java 14 and stabilized in Java 16, a later JDK can be required to build packages - and the Gradle build scripts for those releases may only work with that JDK; * **QuPath v0.4** is intended to be built with **Java 17**; * **QuPath v0.3*",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:3156,test,test,3156,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['test'],['test']

Usability,"is time. Which leads on to... ### Working together. QuPath is being developed at the University of Edinburgh.; One way to contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress.

Changes frequently break scripts... and thereby annoy users; * It's preferable to break a script completely rather than subtly change its behavior (since no results flag a problem, while wrong results can slip through unnoticed). ### Code style. * The best guide is usually to ensure new code looks much like the existing code; * Use standard Java conventions, e.g. `CamelCase` with a capital letter at the start of a class name and small letter for variable or method; * [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) is used to enforce some style rules; * These are currently fairly minimal... but might increase over time; * The 'correct' [modifier order](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_modifier.html#ModifierOrder) should be used; * Test source files should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPat",MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:8835,guid,guide,8835,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['guid'],['guide']

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you; these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have; certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if; you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether; gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same; freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive; or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they; know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:; (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License; giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains; that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and; authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as; changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to; authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run; modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer; can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of; protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic; pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to; use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we; have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those; products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we; stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions; of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
