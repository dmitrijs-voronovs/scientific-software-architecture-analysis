Availability,"Dear Sir,; Thank you very much for answering and helping me. ; recently, several chemoinformatic tools has been developed to either cluster existing reactions using molecular fingerprint and machinery learning techniques, or produce new reactions for a set of molecules using the concept of generalized reaction rules. these methods are dependant on molecular fingerprints or mol files. as far as I know, the concept of aromaticity is only available in canonical SMILES structure not in molecular fingerprint or mol file. so when we convert an aromatic SMILES to these kind of molecular descriptor, we only consider one tautomer out of all possible structures. that is why I was looking for a function to produce all valence tautomers.

Availability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.).

Availability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

Availability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. Great. That looks really nice. I knew that you had done some work on it, but I didn't see it in the help on 'babel'. Regarding regular expressions, I just mean an asterisk. Often all the actives (e.g. in drug docking) would come from a different database (e.g. drawn by hand) than the inactives, and can be simply identified by common elements in their title. Would it be possible to use an expression like ""MY_FIRST_DATAFIELD>1.4 && MY_SECOND_DATAFIELD='NOT_IN_STOCK'"". I note that a possible problem is data fields that contain spaces in the names. I think that you will have to enforce some rules such as, if there's a space in the name, use an underscore in the query. It would be good also if babel warned if no field matched one of the terms in the query (and perhaps printed out some possibilities), as I imagine that this will be a common error.

Availability,"On the list, Craig said:; ""This is OpenBabel's other main flaw (the first one being the handling of chirality, which is currently under revision). Here is a repeat of a message I sent to this list on 3/21/2006. ---------------------. Chris and Geoff,. I'm having a devil of a time with hydrogens, and it all seems to boil down to the lack of documentation in the original OpenBabel code. It appears that the notions of ""implicit hydrogens"" and ""implicit valence"" aren't documented, and it seems to be used to mean different things depending on who was writing code, where the molecule came from, and where it's going. * In some cases, the number of hydrogens is assumed to be the ImplicitHydrogen count (regardless of whether there are other explicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888:322,down,down,322,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"One option to keep this more contained could be to change pybel from a module to a package — i.e. a directory called ""pybel"" that contains an `__init__.py` file. Then you can add supplementary files or subdirectories like ""static"" or ""js"" without polluting the main python site-packages directory. In terms of the python code, it would be possible to keep the change transparent to the user. You could just put it all the code in `__init__.py`, or separate it out into multiple python files and use imports in `__init__.py` to define the interface. The downside to this would be that you lose the simplicity of just having pybel as a single file. But with `imolecule.min.js` being added anyway, having a pybel directory containing everything might be better than having disparate files.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/80#issuecomment-45320158:553,down,downside,553,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/80#issuecomment-45320158,1,['down'],['downside']

Availability,"Thanks for looking into this Tim. My own feeling is that there are two separate issues here:. 1. Can an atom with a hydrogen and a lone pair be stereogenic? This is related to stereocenter perception. Let me ping @johnmay on this. I'm pretty sure there are cases of this related to S (maybe not N), but I think John can clear this up.; 2. Should RemoveHydrogens() suppress hydrogens involved in cis/trans stereo? I think the answer to this is no. One of the invariants of the toolkit should be that suppressing and expanding hydrogens should not change any information. Note that (1) and (2) are separate issues. I've changed the SMILES reader so that stereo perception is optional (""-aS""). By default, stereo is just read directly from the SMILES (same behaviour as OEChem and CDK, at least). This improves performance when reading SMILES, and preserves stereo present in the input even where our stereoperception would remove it:; ```; $ obabel -:""C[C@](C)(C)C"" -osmi; C[C@](C)(C)C	; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396:208,ping,ping,208,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396,1,['ping'],['ping']

I suppose I was low-key wondering how I was getting results, given that I didn't think MMFF94 supported radicals either, but the geometry guesses I looked at were fine for my application and I assumed obabel had some special way of handling these radicals. So I guess now I'm not sure what's going on, and why most radicals work (or ""work"") but the aforementioned one does not. For what it's worth, I don't actually need perfect geometries for my application because my next step is to feed them to a more accurate optimization. In fact for my purposes I could even obtain the geometry of the anion from obabel and let the more accurate optimization fine-tune the anion to the radical. So getting this perfect isn't immediately crucial to me but I am now curious what obabel is actually doing (and if you have a recommendation for the best way to process radicals in obabel to generate a good starting guess for a more accurate method, I'm all ears).

As Geoff said that tag is not supposed to be computer-readable, so the supplied CIF files are actually incomplete. But the ""_space_group.transform_*"" tags which should be used instead are not handled by openbabel right now (reading them is one thing, but the spacegroup routines would have to take those into account). It would be so much simpler if the files always included the unique Hall symbol, ot the list of transforms... All this being said, the list in spacegroup.txt does include all the origin choices 1 and 2 (e.g. ""P 4/n m m:1"" and ""P 4/n m m:2""). So I have now added a hack in cifformat.cpp, so that when a HM symbol is found an the _space_group.IT_coordinate_system_code is equal to '1' or '2', the HM symbol is appended with ':1' or ':2', which is then correctly interpreted by the spacegroup routines.

Availability,"ps is International Tables for Crystallography.; But while it is clear what are the names and operations of the standard settings for each space groups, and of popular alternative settings, it may not be so clear for some obscure settings. To clarify: for many space groups you can have alternative settings with changed basis and/or shifted origin. Any two settings of the same space group can be transformed into each other by applying a 4x4 transformation matrix. The question is what settings are practical, useful and worth listing in a table. And what are their standard (H-M) names. (There is no problem with interpreting Hall names: they are unambiguous and they encode all the operations in the name). ITfC has a few tables that list spacegroup settings (in Vol. A and B). These tables list different sets of settings, and they may differ between editions of ITfC. The table that is most commonly used in computer programs is in Vol. B. It is the same table that is used by SgInfo and cctbx/sgtbx (and spglib) and it's available here: http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/hall_symbols.html. It has 530 entries (3 are duplicate, as @afonari wrote above; different standard names correspond to the same sets of operations). The only thing that differs is that Open Babel recognizes 14 (as @afonari calculated) extra settings. It's probably good, but there is no good reference for naming of these settings.; For example: ""C -4 2 b"" is listed on http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/MEDIUM/117cz1.htm, but not in ITfC. ITfC have a C-centered settings of the same spacegroup (117) named ""C -4 2 g1"". This name is listed in table 1.5.4.4 in Vol.A ch.1.5 (and without any further information), but not in the table with Hall symbols. So I'm not able to tell if ""C -4 2 g1"" from ITfC and ""C -4 2 b"" from Birkbeck collage website refer to the same settings. Regarding shared resources: most of the programs I've seen use either the list of [530 settings][1] or the [syminfo.lib][2] file from CCP4 (or the older versio",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1292#issuecomment-331963893:1162,avail,available,1162,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1292#issuecomment-331963893,1,['avail'],['available']

I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3).

SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-copy behavior when the API caller can promise that the molecule object won't be changed. I can look at this some more and improve the patch, but need feedback on which route to prioritize.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991:1550,update,update,1550,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991,2,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'update']"

Deployability,"@arebruvold No, it is not twisted. However the configuration of the N=N double bond is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples. Because SMILES and subsequently SMARTS can be very helpful to search in databases, I recommend to complement your study with the two blog posts by Noel O'Boyle [SMARTS for dummies](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2018/11/smarts-for-dummies.html), its sequel [Smarts for Dummies Part II ](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2023/02/smarts-for-dummies-part-ii.html) and the interactive [test pad](https://baoilleach.github.io/smartersmarts-js/) (requires only a web browser, JavaScript enabled). Finally, Marvin by ChemAxon introduced [extended SMILES](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/formats_chemaxon-extended-smiles-and-smarts-cxsmiles-and-cxsmarts.md) as a format to retain additional information some programs equally can process, too (e.g. [Marvin JS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/); [CDK depict](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#cxsmiles-cxsmarts-extensions)).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2699#issuecomment-2127061510:47,configurat,configuration,47,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2699#issuecomment-2127061510,3,['configurat'],['configuration']

I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3).

Deployability,"FWIW:. This bugs stems from the unfortunate choice to give the Python extension the version 3.1.1.1, which seems to cause `StrictVersion(find_version())` to fail with `invalid version number '3.1.1.1'`, which is then printed as a warning.

As far as naming the package, it seems that there are really two issues at play.; 1. We want to be clear in our google searches, so people don't get mislead to think the pypi page is openbabel proper.; 2. We also want to follow python pypi conventions. For reason #2, it is ideal to call the package ""openbabel"", for reason #1 we might want to call it ""openbabel-python"". . As a compromise, I recommend calling it ""openbabel"" but improving the readme to include a link to openbabel proper website. The readme file will be included on the website, and any users that find it will be immediately redirected to the main website if desired.

Deployability,"I assume your note. > Well I can import babel in python now. relates to an eventual successful installation of openbabel with `pip install openbabel-wheel` from PyPI *instead* of the standard openbabel (and `pip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment.

One should not just make a simple patch to switch a pkg-config arrangement.

Deployability,"I started to convert your `.sdf` test files into `.pdb` by `obabel -isdf <ligand_name>.sdf -opdb -O <ligand_name>.pdb` with Open Babel (version 3.1.0 in Linux Debian, I suggest you check if you equally may update to this) and displayed them pairwise in an elder installation of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05). Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`. The visualizations by Jmol then look considerably better. Could such an edit equally be helpful for you?. The obvious question is about the difference between the original and the modified `.sdf` files. According to a difference view with `vimdiff` (an extension of the vim editor) or [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) (version 3.20.2) is that both the number of columns in the upper part of the connectivity table increase, as well as the connectivities are in part defined differently.

Deployability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. I'm a bit worried now about that patch...say if it wasn't necessary, or it's some horrible mistake? I'm not very confident with the whole C++ thing... The original problem remained, but has been resolved simply by defining a vector of OBAtom* in the interface file. Sorry about the big song and dance. In addition, I should have been using OBResidueAtomIter in any case (which works), rather than accessing GetAtoms() directly. So...were these two unrelated problems, or was openbabel genuinely unable to read these files...? I should try to convert 1ABE.pdb with babel.exe prior to the patch and see what happens...

Deployability,"Okay, this isn't a valid fix. There is no simple fix. If the istream belongs to the user, you have no way of knowing if it has been deallocated or not by the time you get to the OBConversion destructor (if they were both declared as local variables, for instance, and go out of scope at the same time). It it is still valid, then the rdbuf needs to be replaced before deallocating pLineEndBuf. It is no longer valid, you can't do this. The correct solution is to install all filtering on top of the user provided stream. This could be done relatively easily as a general framework that would apply to the zlib filters (which I'm guessing, from looking at the code, also leak memory). I'd be willing to take the time to implement this, but would be much more enthusiastic about it if I could use the boost iostreams libraries.

Side notes:. - dash, colon, pairwise single/double quotes in `-:""c1ccccc1""` already indicate to OpenBabel ""the input enclosed by the quotes is going to be a SMILES string"". - if the file extension is one described by the manual (cf. [readthedocs](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), the explicit indication can be dropped. Indeed, `-icml` in the instruction `obabel -icml aromatic_cml.txt -osmi` only was necessary because the input file *of .cml syntax* uses a non-conventional file extension for a .cml, namely `.txt`.

Then I aggregate the vector representations of the atoms involved in each reaction into a vector representation of each reaction as a whole. Then I use those reaction vector representations as data in a machine learning pipeline. Thanks @baoilleach, I tried keeping a reference to each reactants Molecule in my Reaction class (which I had been planning on doing anyway but hadn't remembered and hadn't needed to use yet) and that seems to keep all of the Atom instances valid at least in my initial tests involving what hadn't worked previously.

I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3).

Note, however, beside the crystallographic model (e.g., unit cell, symmetry operations, atom coordinates), a `.cif` file equally may contain instructions how this model was refined, as well as a reduced representation of the experimental diffraction data. Their consistency is probed with checksums (test [PLAT012](https://journals.iucr.org/services/cif/checking/PLAT012.html)) by Platon, because these two would both allow a) to replicate the construction of the model, and b) build an other, possibly improved, model.

Additional (virtual) functions in the depiction code with different effects for SVG, PNG, etc I think would be necessary.

Energy Efficiency,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

Energy Efficiency,"Please compare the above structure with the [pubchem 2D structure](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5761#section=2D-Structure), showing, in green, a H which 'protrudes towards the camera'. The same H is depicted as 'protruding' above the ring with the NCH3 group in [the wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide#/media/File:LSD-2D-skeletal-formula-and-3D-models.png). The Pubchem 3D shows the hydrogen in more detail. My point is that obabel's depiction of this molecule with the flags I used provides an image structure where this H 'protrudes' below the molecule, but in line with a C-C bond in the ring it is a member of, so you have both lines running in the same direction, one on top of the other, and although this may structurally possible, for the purposes of depicting the structure, it is less clear than the two references included above. Now this may be because I'm using obabel incorrectly, and if so, totally cool. But although I'm new to the notion of implicit and explicit hydrogens in the context of cheminformatics and 2D structure depictions, the flags I have used have hidden all the implicit hydrogens, but not the case H in point which appears to be nonetheless plotted, but in a way which is confusing, and irrespective, I was urged to log this as a bug by Geoff, so assumed it was therefore a bug. Therefore, I'm hoping that either; 1. Someone with authority admits this is a bug; 2. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me I'm using the wrong flags (and hopefully graciously corrects me) and obabel produces the same structure but with this H sticking out on its own or; 3. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me that this is a feature of obabel, and irrespective of the flags, I will not be able to plot this H in such a way that it 'sticks out' without being plotted over another bond in which case, I can close this issue and use a different tool for those structures I have to plot where I find this anomaly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084:149,green,green,149,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084,1,['green'],['green']
Energy Efficiency,"Referring to both comments, being a final degree project there were some time limits I had to stick to in order to finish it and make the changes (in about 3 to 5 months, including learning chemistry and understanding the base code from scratch). ; That's why we were not really considering to include too much external feedback, which could have made this process more complex. The project had specific goals, and in that time frame I came up with these solutions. I am by no means an expert in chemistry and my knowledge is quite scarce.; So you will probably find many things that can be improved, done in a more efficient way or better approaches that I might not have thought of.

Energy Efficiency,"Thank you so much for looking into my problem!; I tried `obabel -ipdb ligand_1.pdb -h -opdb -O add_h.pdb` in my environment and it results as you described. It kept the original atom label and the residue name. While, there are still 2 problems about this:; 1. The `--p ph` flag and the python usage `mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(False, True, ph)` still do not keep atom label and residue name, which the ph will make big difference on the result. In my result with ph=7.0, the phosphates are all deprotonated and openbabel gives a good formal charge along with the connectivity. ; 2. Even in the way that keeps atom label and residue name, there's no different name for newly added Hydrogens. I looked into the naming rule of tleap in Amber and it is just simply adding element count after the element name. Like this:; ```; HETATM 59 H UNL 1 66.036 57.777 14.518 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 60 H1 UNL 1 69.447 60.888 17.041 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 61 H2 UNL 1 67.790 60.750 17.415 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 62 H3 UNL 1 72.206 58.616 13.563 1.00 0.00 H ; ```. I actually fixed my problem by writing a function in my workflow to fix the openbabel generated file (just count the element and give them new amber readable names.) ; Also I found some potential problems of the protonation function:; 1. The protonation will be plausible only when I start from a raw PDB without H and connectivity. Weird H will be added if you start from a protonated PDB (like ligand_1_aH.pdb), or remove H first with openbabel and then add H. .

Integrability,", ostream* pos); {; if(pos) SetOutStream(pos, false);. if(!pOutFormat || !pOutput) return false;. SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-copy behavior when the API caller can promise that the molecule object won't be changed. I can look at this some more and improve the patch, but need feedback on which route to prioritize.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991:2167,rout,route,2167,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991,1,['rout'],['route']

Integrability,"Dear Sir,; Thank you very much for answering and helping me. ; recently, several chemoinformatic tools has been developed to either cluster existing reactions using molecular fingerprint and machinery learning techniques, or produce new reactions for a set of molecules using the concept of generalized reaction rules. these methods are dependant on molecular fingerprints or mol files. as far as I know, the concept of aromaticity is only available in canonical SMILES structure not in molecular fingerprint or mol file. so when we convert an aromatic SMILES to these kind of molecular descriptor, we only consider one tautomer out of all possible structures. that is why I was looking for a function to produce all valence tautomers. I could generate kekule forms by writing the following c++ function:. pair<string,string> getKekulizedSmiles(const vector<string>& newVector, int i); {; string canSmiles;; string kekSmiles;; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; canSmiles = newVector[i];; if (! conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""smi"")); {; cout<<""Formats not available\n"";; }; conv.ReadString(&mol,canSmiles);; conv.SetOptions(""xC"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; conv.SetOptions(""xk"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; kekSmiles = conv.WriteString(&mol, true);; return {canSmiles, kekSmiles};; }. though, I still don't know what does '-xk' do. :)).

Integrability,"Each time one wants to report an issue about openbabel here on GitHub, the interface provides you with a template. This is to help you to organize your observation(s), and others to identify the possible cause; typically leading to an improvement how the program is used or/and an improvement of the program. You still can edit your question with the bits and bolts the template provides; perhaps especially to organize a report in sections (initiated by a head line following the `##`):. ```; ## Environment Information; Open Babel version:; Operating system and version:. ## Expected Behavior; <!-- Describe the intended output or what you expected to see. -->. ## Actual Behavior; <!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; ```. In addition, the interface allows to discern running text on one hand, from snippets of code / output back to the CLI on the other hand by markup as a code block: add three backticks in a line prior, and three backticks in a line following the section. Do not confuse backticks with single quotes. Because some characters might have a particular meaning to (GitHub flavored) [markdown syntax](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) used here, it equally is *safer* to enclose SMILES and SMARTS in backticks, too. This equally eases to copy-paste them from here to a local instance of running openbabel.

Integrability,"I also see only 2 molecules converted on 32bit Windows (with the development code). But the problem is data dependent and intermittent. Apparently irrelevant changes during debugging can make the problem go away and the read position in the input file apparently moves erratically. So an over-writing or alignment problem looks probable. The header is binary but its interpretation in C++ makes assumptions about how a C++ struct is laid out - clearly not a good idea. I have in the past written a version with the header in ASCII but did not proceed because correcting another bug seemed to solve the problem. . It seems likely that the bug is a more general I/O on the header and not confined to 64bit systems. I'll try revising the header reading and writing code.

Integrability,"On the list, Craig said:; ""This is OpenBabel's other main flaw (the first one being the handling of chirality, which is currently under revision). Here is a repeat of a message I sent to this list on 3/21/2006. ---------------------. Chris and Geoff,. I'm having a devil of a time with hydrogens, and it all seems to boil down to the lack of documentation in the original OpenBabel code. It appears that the notions of ""implicit hydrogens"" and ""implicit valence"" aren't documented, and it seems to be used to mean different things depending on who was writing code, where the molecule came from, and where it's going. * In some cases, the number of hydrogens is assumed to be the ImplicitHydrogen count (regardless of whether there are other explicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888:169,message,message,169,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888,2,"['depend', 'message']","['depending', 'message']"

In terms of the python code, it would be possible to keep the change transparent to the user.

Integrability,"This is a DDL2 dictionary tag ; (symcif: http://oldwww.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/cifdic_html/2/cif_sym.dic/index.html), which current OB code does not fully support. As Geoff said that tag is not supposed to be computer-readable, so the supplied CIF files are actually incomplete. But the ""_space_group.transform_*"" tags which should be used instead are not handled by openbabel right now (reading them is one thing, but the spacegroup routines would have to take those into account). It would be so much simpler if the files always included the unique Hall symbol, ot the list of transforms... All this being said, the list in spacegroup.txt does include all the origin choices 1 and 2 (e.g. ""P 4/n m m:1"" and ""P 4/n m m:2""). So I have now added a hack in cifformat.cpp, so that when a HM symbol is found an the _space_group.IT_coordinate_system_code is equal to '1' or '2', the HM symbol is appended with ':1' or ':2', which is then correctly interpreted by the spacegroup routines. This is available in SVN head. Since :1 and :2 probably are the most common cases for this tag, this should be helpful. Other values for this tag will generate an appropriate warning.

Integrability,"nbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2. This however is more and more an exception.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1832,depend,dependencies,1832,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

In addition, the interface allows to discern running text on one hand, from snippets of code / output back to the CLI on the other hand by markup as a code block: add three backticks in a line prior, and three backticks in a line following the section. Do not confuse backticks with single quotes. Because some characters might have a particular meaning to (GitHub flavored) [markdown syntax](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) used here, it equally is *safer* to enclose SMILES and SMARTS in backticks, too. This equally eases to copy-paste them from here to a local instance of running openbabel.

Integrability,"xplicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle cases where an atom is not in its normal valence state, or where the element's valence is not obvious. Once the actual-hydrogen or actual-valence values is defined, the ""implicit valence"" and ""implicit hydrogen"" count functions can be rewritten as derived properties rather than fundamental properties, and ""implicit valence"" functions can be marked as ""deprecated"" in the documentation. The SMILES parser could then easily note what an atom's actual valence is, as could other parsers. I think it's critical that we fix this, first by documenting how it is *supposed* to work, then by fixing the two most-affected parsers: mdlformat.cpp and smilesformat.cpp. (Or, I should say, these are the ones I need ;-) )."".

Modifiability,"@arebruvold No, it is not twisted. However the configuration of the N=N double bond is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen.

If the istream belongs to the user, you have no way of knowing if it has been deallocated or not by the time you get to the OBConversion destructor (if they were both declared as local variables, for instance, and go out of scope at the same time). It it is still valid, then the rdbuf needs to be replaced before deallocating pLineEndBuf. It is no longer valid, you can't do this. The correct solution is to install all filtering on top of the user provided stream.

On Linux, by default, everything is exposed, while on Windows you have to specify which ones to expose. More to the point, we tend to avoid extending the OB API unless necessary. I'd suggest you simply move the data_utilities.cpp out of the openbabel core and into the thermo target. Obviously there's no linking problem then. However, if you can make a case for keeping them where they are (e.g. are these functions of general use to OB users?), I'm happy to do the necessary to expose the functions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/200#issuecomment-124572140:232,extend,extending,232,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/200#issuecomment-124572140,1,['extend'],['extending']

Modifiability,"There are a few example about how to use the OpenBabel Module here: https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UseTheLibrary/PythonDoc.html. Taking the SMILES example and adapting for .mol2, try using the following as a starting point:; ```python; from openbabel import openbabel. obConversion = openbabel.OBConversion(); obConversion.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""mol2""). mol = openbabel.OBMol(); obConversion.ReadString(mol, ""C1=CC=CS1""); mol.AddHydrogens(); openbabel.OBBuilder().Build(mol) # To get coordinates. # If you just want the string; mol2string = obConversion.WriteString(mol). # To save as a .mol2 file; obConversion.WriteFile(mol, ""out.mol2""); ```. Alternatively, you can use the `pybel` module, which is somewhat simplified:; ```python; from openbabel import pybel; mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C1=CC=CS1""); mol.addh(); mol.make3D(); mol.write(""mol2"", ""out.mol2""); ```. However, I believe it is much simpler to call the `obabel` executable:; ```sh; obabel -:""C1=CC=CS1"" --gen3D -O out.mol2; ```; which can be called from Python via:; ```python; import os; os.system(""obabel -:\""C1=CC=CS1\"" --gen3D -O out.mol2""); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2351#issuecomment-817998811:172,adapt,adapting,172,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2351#issuecomment-817998811,1,['adapt'],['adapting']

Modifiability,"d is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples. Because SMILES and subsequently SMARTS can be very helpful to search in databases, I recommend to complement your study with the two blog posts by Noel O'Boyle [SMARTS for dummies](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2018/11/smarts-for-dummies.html), its sequel [Smarts for Dummies Part II ](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2023/02/smarts-for-dummies-part-ii.html) and the interactive [test pad](https://baoilleach.github.io/smartersmarts-js/) (requires only a web browser, JavaScript enabled). Finally, Marvin by ChemAxon introduced [extended SMILES](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/formats_chemaxon-extended-smiles-and-smarts-cxsmiles-and-cxsmarts.md) as a format to retain additional information some programs equally can process, too (e.g. [Marvin JS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/); [CDK depict](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#cxsmiles-cxsmarts-extensions)).

I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3).

Performance,"Let me explain (but not excuse) what's happening here. We have some code to short circuit InChI to InChIKey conversion. Basically on reading an InChI (and only an InChI), the InChI is stored as an attribute of the molecule. Any subsequent requests for the InChI just use this stored value rather than recalculating it. Without this short circuit, the conversion would be done by reading an InChI into an OBMol, converting the OBMol into an InChI and then subsequently into an InChIKey. The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure). Modifying the molecule in-between clearly invalidates the InChI, but we don't have a mechanism internally to intercept modifications, so this is left to the user. If you ""print(inchi.data)"" you will see the offending data item. Deleting this (""del inchi.data['inchi']"") removes the cached value. In general I don't like automagic stuff like this, as it breaks code in complicated and unexpected ways. We could give up on accurate InChI->InChIKey conversion, or only cache the value if the user specifies an option.

Performance,"Thanks for looking into this Tim. My own feeling is that there are two separate issues here:. 1. Can an atom with a hydrogen and a lone pair be stereogenic? This is related to stereocenter perception. Let me ping @johnmay on this. I'm pretty sure there are cases of this related to S (maybe not N), but I think John can clear this up.; 2. Should RemoveHydrogens() suppress hydrogens involved in cis/trans stereo? I think the answer to this is no. One of the invariants of the toolkit should be that suppressing and expanding hydrogens should not change any information. Note that (1) and (2) are separate issues. I've changed the SMILES reader so that stereo perception is optional (""-aS""). By default, stereo is just read directly from the SMILES (same behaviour as OEChem and CDK, at least). This improves performance when reading SMILES, and preserves stereo present in the input even where our stereoperception would remove it:; ```; $ obabel -:""C[C@](C)(C)C"" -osmi; C[C@](C)(C)C	; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396:808,perform,performance,808,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396,1,['perform'],['performance']

I suppose I was low-key wondering how I was getting results, given that I didn't think MMFF94 supported radicals either, but the geometry guesses I looked at were fine for my application and I assumed obabel had some special way of handling these radicals. So I guess now I'm not sure what's going on, and why most radicals work (or ""work"") but the aforementioned one does not. For what it's worth, I don't actually need perfect geometries for my application because my next step is to feed them to a more accurate optimization. In fact for my purposes I could even obtain the geometry of the anion from obabel and let the more accurate optimization fine-tune the anion to the radical. So getting this perfect isn't immediately crucial to me but I am now curious what obabel is actually doing (and if you have a recommendation for the best way to process radicals in obabel to generate a good starting guess for a more accurate method, I'm all ears).

Performance,"er above?* (Please see edit). Regarding the version being old, I understand, will try to compile from the latest, this is the version that Ubuntu has in its repositories by the way. **EDIT:**. I think I see what the problem is here, that was not the best part of the graph to demonstrate the ""problem"" with. Granted, some bonds are described ""asymmetrically"" (so, the information exists only in one way but not the other, as implied by `OBBond`). But in addition to this, the molecule appears to be fragmented because it is indeed missing some bonds. Here is a better part of that map I am showing earlier:. <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1336337/78693890-c3778f00-78f3-11ea-958f-b22d060f1f2d.png"" width=""512""/>. Notice 82:(H->Nam->C3->C2->O), 83:(H->Nam->C3->C2->O), **84:(H->Nam->C3->C3->C3->...)**. That has been skipped indeed but that is not the whole picture because it has ""fragments"", which are all put on the side (because they are interpreted as subgraphs) and they look like this:. <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1336337/78694834-274e8780-78f5-11ea-81e5-270f3ccb412d.png"" width=""350""/>. All of these are fragments that **""match""** the location of my odd results. The reason there are so many hydrogens here is because I have first called `.addh()`. That function, finds a nitrogen that does not appear to be bonded with anything (the N3 of residue 85) and adds 3 hydrogens around it. It is easy to overcome the assymetric reporting of bonds as I now first build a Networkx graph that has `OBAtom` at its nodes and `OBBond` at its edges and then perform search on **that** graph. I am not sure how easy it would be to overcome this lack of bonds though. . All I can think of at the moment is check if NCCO are grouped under a residue but the residue's subgraph is disconnected. If it is disconnected, then......it would take some guessing as to where these bonds must be added. Unless there is a systematic way to infer which bonds are missing (?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2156#issuecomment-610311498:3111,perform,perform,3111,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2156#issuecomment-610311498,1,['perform'],['perform']

Safety,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

In this time, `v4`, I think everything should be fine. Exactly as the original codes behavior when error happens:. ```; Pseudocode, validation in sequence:. 1) If format is defined:; - ValueError on format itself will be raised if it does not work; else:; - try to guess from filename; * ValueError prompted for file not exists; * ValueError when format does not work. 2) If filename is not valid:; - OSError will be raised; ```.

I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file.

This is to help you to organize your observation(s), and others to identify the possible cause; typically leading to an improvement how the program is used or/and an improvement of the program. You still can edit your question with the bits and bolts the template provides; perhaps especially to organize a report in sections (initiated by a head line following the `##`):. ```; ## Environment Information; Open Babel version:; Operating system and version:. ## Expected Behavior; <!-- Describe the intended output or what you expected to see. -->. ## Actual Behavior; <!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; ```. In addition, the interface allows to discern running text on one hand, from snippets of code / output back to the CLI on the other hand by markup as a code block: add three backticks in a line prior, and three backticks in a line following the section. Do not confuse backticks with single quotes.

Testability,"I assume your note. > Well I can import babel in python now. relates to an eventual successful installation of openbabel with `pip install openbabel-wheel` from PyPI *instead* of the standard openbabel (and `pip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment.

Testability,"I started to convert your `.sdf` test files into `.pdb` by `obabel -isdf <ligand_name>.sdf -opdb -O <ligand_name>.pdb` with Open Babel (version 3.1.0 in Linux Debian, I suggest you check if you equally may update to this) and displayed them pairwise in an elder installation of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05). Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`. The visualizations by Jmol then look considerably better. Could such an edit equally be helpful for you?. The obvious question is about the difference between the original and the modified `.sdf` files. According to a difference view with `vimdiff` (an extension of the vim editor) or [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) (version 3.20.2) is that both the number of columns in the upper part of the connectivity table increase, as well as the connectivities are in part defined differently.

Testability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.).

Testability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

Testability,OK I left the package name as 'openbabel' and updated the README to explain more clearly that this is just the python bindings along with a link to the main Open Babel site.

Testability,"Please compare the above structure with the [pubchem 2D structure](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5761#section=2D-Structure), showing, in green, a H which 'protrudes towards the camera'. The same H is depicted as 'protruding' above the ring with the NCH3 group in [the wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide#/media/File:LSD-2D-skeletal-formula-and-3D-models.png). The Pubchem 3D shows the hydrogen in more detail. My point is that obabel's depiction of this molecule with the flags I used provides an image structure where this H 'protrudes' below the molecule, but in line with a C-C bond in the ring it is a member of, so you have both lines running in the same direction, one on top of the other, and although this may structurally possible, for the purposes of depicting the structure, it is less clear than the two references included above. Now this may be because I'm using obabel incorrectly, and if so, totally cool. But although I'm new to the notion of implicit and explicit hydrogens in the context of cheminformatics and 2D structure depictions, the flags I have used have hidden all the implicit hydrogens, but not the case H in point which appears to be nonetheless plotted, but in a way which is confusing, and irrespective, I was urged to log this as a bug by Geoff, so assumed it was therefore a bug. Therefore, I'm hoping that either; 1. Someone with authority admits this is a bug; 2. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me I'm using the wrong flags (and hopefully graciously corrects me) and obabel produces the same structure but with this H sticking out on its own or; 3. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me that this is a feature of obabel, and irrespective of the flags, I will not be able to plot this H in such a way that it 'sticks out' without being plotted over another bond in which case, I can close this issue and use a different tool for those structures I have to plot where I find this anomaly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084:1302,log,log,1302,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Thank you so much for your nice explanation @nbehrnd. . Actually, I admit that I modified on purpose the SMILE to be sure that the aromatic flag was not well determined.

Testability,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I understand the source of the issue, but it seems very unpractical. I had never heard of the RAD specification and I don't know a 3D builder that uses it. I don't think anyone is going to go through the trouble of manually specifying radicals, especially with many structures. As a workaround, a unique identifier can be obtained with the `openbabel` InChI + the actual number of hydrogens in the input structure. Not ideal, but relatively simple. Adding some logging at least to indicate if the option has been registered and is valid would be helpful.

Testability,"Without working knowledge about the `.fasta` format, I simply provided a sequence like `ATCG`, requested to OpenBabel to convert this into a joined SMILES string (`-j`, or `--join`) and to write a `.sdf` for visual inspection in Jmol, too. The result is ambivalence. For one, the result already looks «DNA-like» in a ladder-like motif:. ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/116211601-831fc480-a733-11eb-8511-1cec5160032b.png). For the other side, the output is about _two_ molecules instead of the single one I anticipated. In the SMILES, this is marked by the dot laying on the floor; this syntax pattern is seen elsewhere, e.g., to describe co-crystals (presence of more than one molecule in a model, for example a remaining solvent molecule), too. So I speculate, this is / might be «common sense» for the typical user of `.fasta` files (which I'm not), not necessarily an error in OpenBabel.

Testability,"Wow. Okay, digging into the code some more shows that the CML output *never* worked for Write(). The relevant code is the end of the code block:. ```; bool OBConversion::Write(OBBase* pOb, ostream* pos); {; if(pos) SetOutStream(pos, false);. if(!pOutFormat || !pOutput) return false;. SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-co",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991:757,test,test,757,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ave alternative settings with changed basis and/or shifted origin. Any two settings of the same space group can be transformed into each other by applying a 4x4 transformation matrix. The question is what settings are practical, useful and worth listing in a table. And what are their standard (H-M) names. (There is no problem with interpreting Hall names: they are unambiguous and they encode all the operations in the name). ITfC has a few tables that list spacegroup settings (in Vol. A and B). These tables list different sets of settings, and they may differ between editions of ITfC. The table that is most commonly used in computer programs is in Vol. B. It is the same table that is used by SgInfo and cctbx/sgtbx (and spglib) and it's available here: http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/hall_symbols.html. It has 530 entries (3 are duplicate, as @afonari wrote above; different standard names correspond to the same sets of operations). The only thing that differs is that Open Babel recognizes 14 (as @afonari calculated) extra settings. It's probably good, but there is no good reference for naming of these settings.; For example: ""C -4 2 b"" is listed on http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/MEDIUM/117cz1.htm, but not in ITfC. ITfC have a C-centered settings of the same spacegroup (117) named ""C -4 2 g1"". This name is listed in table 1.5.4.4 in Vol.A ch.1.5 (and without any further information), but not in the table with Hall symbols. So I'm not able to tell if ""C -4 2 g1"" from ITfC and ""C -4 2 b"" from Birkbeck collage website refer to the same settings. Regarding shared resources: most of the programs I've seen use either the list of [530 settings][1] or the [syminfo.lib][2] file from CCP4 (or the older version named `symop.lib`).; I guess it's unavoidable that different programs recognize different sets of symbols, as there is no definite list.

Testability,"d is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples.

Testability,"nbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2.

Usability,", ostream* pos); {; if(pos) SetOutStream(pos, false);. if(!pOutFormat || !pOutput) return false;. SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-copy behavior when the API caller can promise that the molecule object won't be changed.

That of course is at conflict with the Lewis formula (and molfile) which features 3 bonds, two C-N and one C-Pt.

Usability,"@UnixJunkie On an Ubuntu machine, you can fetch the sources for the Debian experimental package by doing:; `dget http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openbabel/openbabel_2.4.1-1.dsc`; You can then build locally, and create a PPA if desired. @baoilleach https://launchpad.net/openbabel appears to be a project in Launchpad's Bazaar VCS, I have no idea if it is possible to transfer ownership. You could trying asking a question 'for Launchpad itself' at https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad. I'm not sure if having an openbabel project on Launchpad has any advantages over simply publishing a PPA from your own Launchpad account. You could base it on the version from Debian experimental, as above. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openbabel is the source package for the versions available from the Ubuntu repositories. If a new version is uploaded to Debian unstable within the next 5 months or so, it will automatically be pulled into the 18.04 LTS development version.

Usability,"@arebruvold No, it is not twisted. However the configuration of the N=N double bond is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples.

Usability,"@baoilleach Thank you very much, this is helpful at this point. I agree about the `[C, CR5]` simplification, it may have been a remnant of earlier queries when I was trying to be more specific on which atoms I am after. Regarding:; > OB matches the all-atom structure whereas the PDB file is often missing bonds and bond orders, so these must be inferred. I am not sure I fully understand what it means (?) but I may have come across this already, see if this is relevant:. Right after this ticket, I wrote my own matcher for the structure I am after, which is a simple recursive matcher starting on the N. If the N matches, it unrolls its bonds and tries to match the C, unrolls its bonds....and so on. In the end, if there is a match starting from an N, all the matching atoms are returned. Again, 1GCN matches just fine, but 6QWY fails. But now, since I am in complete control of the matching process, I traced each match level and realised that the graph is taking a ""detour"". The main chain proceeds uninterrupted (that is, there are `OBBond` s describing the `NCC(=O)`, **EXCEPT** in some residues. Here is an example:. <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1336337/78659371-5cda7d00-78c3-11ea-943c-c08a2afaf570.png"" width=""200""/>. Notice residue 16, Nam->C3->C2, Residue 17, Nam->C3 and then the C3-C2 bond is only described from the C2 end. After realising this, I decided to first create the implied graph and then run the matcher on the graph. *Is this what you mean by implied bonds further above?* (Please see edit). Regarding the version being old, I understand, will try to compile from the latest, this is the version that Ubuntu has in its repositories by the way. **EDIT:**. I think I see what the problem is here, that was not the best part of the graph to demonstrate the ""problem"" with. Granted, some bonds are described ""asymmetrically"" (so, the information exists only in one way but not the other, as implied by `OBBond`).

Usability,"@baoilleach: the set of space group is indeed fixed -- there are 230 3D space groups.; *The* reference for the names of the space groups is International Tables for Crystallography.; But while it is clear what are the names and operations of the standard settings for each space groups, and of popular alternative settings, it may not be so clear for some obscure settings. To clarify: for many space groups you can have alternative settings with changed basis and/or shifted origin. Any two settings of the same space group can be transformed into each other by applying a 4x4 transformation matrix. The question is what settings are practical, useful and worth listing in a table. And what are their standard (H-M) names. (There is no problem with interpreting Hall names: they are unambiguous and they encode all the operations in the name). ITfC has a few tables that list spacegroup settings (in Vol. A and B). These tables list different sets of settings, and they may differ between editions of ITfC. The table that is most commonly used in computer programs is in Vol. B. It is the same table that is used by SgInfo and cctbx/sgtbx (and spglib) and it's available here: http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/hall_symbols.html. It has 530 entries (3 are duplicate, as @afonari wrote above; different standard names correspond to the same sets of operations). The only thing that differs is that Open Babel recognizes 14 (as @afonari calculated) extra settings. It's probably good, but there is no good reference for naming of these settings.; For example: ""C -4 2 b"" is listed on http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/MEDIUM/117cz1.htm, but not in ITfC. ITfC have a C-centered settings of the same spacegroup (117) named ""C -4 2 g1"". This name is listed in table 1.5.4.4 in Vol.A ch.1.5 (and without any further information), but not in the table with Hall symbols.

Their consistency is probed with checksums (test [PLAT012](https://journals.iucr.org/services/cif/checking/PLAT012.html)) by Platon, because these two would both allow a) to replicate the construction of the model, and b) build an other, possibly improved, model.

This is particularly important for example with ammine (NH3) ligands, where most software mis-represents cisplatin as [PtCl2(NH2)2] instead of [PtCl2(NH3)2] without explicit hydrogens, since they do not recognize the use of the free electron pair on the ammonia ligands for bonding, which does along with increase of ""valence"" on N from 3 to 4 and try to maintain the ""standard valence"" of N as 3 by removing one H to NH2 instead of NH3",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2656#issuecomment-1860585524:365,clear,clearly,365,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2656#issuecomment-1860585524,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Given the simplicity of methane, GROMOS possibly is just fine with default `--gen3d` as starting geometry OpenBabel provides here. It often is the sweet spot of computational cost among the five levels of 3D coordinate generation offered. (The manual points to a dedicated publication to balance pros and cons.) For methane in particular, there is no need for an extended permutation of rotor search `--gen3d best` (or `--gen3d slowest`) offer, either. .

Usability,"FWIW:. This bugs stems from the unfortunate choice to give the Python extension the version 3.1.1.1, which seems to cause `StrictVersion(find_version())` to fail with `invalid version number '3.1.1.1'`, which is then printed as a warning. For my own purpose, I managed to work around this by ""tweaking"" the version number in the version check to `3.1.1`, so that pkgconfig finds the libs and can compile the extension against them (and the `setup.py` does not need to revert back to looking in `/usr/local`). ```diff; diff -u -r openbabel-3.1.1.1.orig/setup.py openbabel-3.1.1.1/setup.py; --- openbabel-3.1.1.1.orig/setup.py	2020-05-23 06:54:26.000000000 -0230; +++ openbabel-3.1.1.1/setup.py	2024-04-01 12:34:04.590770399 -0230; @@ -43,7 +43,10 @@; """"""Try use pkgconfig to locate Open Babel, otherwise guess default location.""""""; try:; # Warn if the (major, minor) version of the installed OB doesn't match these python bindings; - py_ver = StrictVersion(find_version()); + py_ver = find_version(); + if py_ver == '3.1.1.1':; + py_ver = '3.1.1'; + py_ver = StrictVersion(py_ver); py_major_ver, py_minor_ver = py_ver.version[:2]; pcfile = 'openbabel-{}'.format(py_major_ver); ob_ver = StrictVersion(pkgconfig(pcfile, '--modversion')); ```. For this to work `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` needs to contain `/path/to/openbabel/lib/pkgconfig` (assuming it's not in any standard location).

Usability,"Hey Noel,. Hope all is well!. The connection to the H is implicit here, not explicit, isn't it? And I don't think the radical thing is having any effect. Take the following three molecules:. CC(=O)N; CC(=O)[NH]; CC(=O)[NH2]. the query [ND1] matches all of these molecules in Daylight, but only the first in OB. Equally the query [Nh2] (N with 2 implicit H's) matches the first and third molecules in Daylight, but only the first in OB. I agree OB is internally consistent here, it's just not agreeing with Daylight, which is what's giving me headaches as I try to port some old code. Here's the relevant bit from the SMILES manual:. <begin>. 3.4.1 Hydrogens; Hydrogen atoms do not normally need to be specified when writing SMILES for most organic structures. The presence of hydrogens may be specified in three ways: . Implicitly.....for atoms specified without brackets, from normal valence assumptions. Explicitly by count.....inside brackets, by the hydrogen count supplied; zero if unspecified. As explicit atoms.....as [H] atoms. <end>. So while I agree they've not made it very clear, my reading of the second point is that if you specify the H count inside the brackets, you've explicitly specified the implicit H count!.

Usability,"I also see only 2 molecules converted on 32bit Windows (with the development code). But the problem is data dependent and intermittent. Apparently irrelevant changes during debugging can make the problem go away and the read position in the input file apparently moves erratically.

I have in the past written a version with the header in ASCII but did not proceed because correcting another bug seemed to solve the problem. . It seems likely that the bug is a more general I/O on the header and not confined to 64bit systems. I'll try revising the header reading and writing code.

Usability,"I released Open Babel 2.0 in 2005, and v3.0 was released in 2019. That's 14 years of API compatibility.

One should not just make a simple patch to switch a pkg-config arrangement. My guess is that whenever 4.0 comes out, the 100 projects (or whatever) will similarly need to make updates - and possibly significant ones.

Usability,"I started to convert your `.sdf` test files into `.pdb` by `obabel -isdf <ligand_name>.sdf -opdb -O <ligand_name>.pdb` with Open Babel (version 3.1.0 in Linux Debian, I suggest you check if you equally may update to this) and displayed them pairwise in an elder installation of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05). Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`. The visualizations by Jmol then look considerably better. Could such an edit equally be helpful for you?. The obvious question is about the difference between the original and the modified `.sdf` files. According to a difference view with `vimdiff` (an extension of the vim editor) or [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) (version 3.20.2) is that both the number of columns in the upper part of the connectivity table increase, as well as the connectivities are in part defined differently.

Usability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds.

Usability,"Let me explain (but not excuse) what's happening here. We have some code to short circuit InChI to InChIKey conversion. Basically on reading an InChI (and only an InChI), the InChI is stored as an attribute of the molecule. Any subsequent requests for the InChI just use this stored value rather than recalculating it. Without this short circuit, the conversion would be done by reading an InChI into an OBMol, converting the OBMol into an InChI and then subsequently into an InChIKey. The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure). Modifying the molecule in-between clearly invalidates the InChI, but we don't have a mechanism internally to intercept modifications, so this is left to the user. If you ""print(inchi.data)"" you will see the offending data item. Deleting this (""del inchi.data['inchi']"") removes the cached value.

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: YES. Yes, this is definitely a workaround. In fact we do completely agree :). That OpenBabel parses files in a locale-dependent way, is clearly an OpenBabel bug, which needs to be fixed there. The C library (sscanf) apparently always honor the locale. So any code using it must be changed to use the C++ library (ifstream...) and call .imbue() on the stream to tell it to assume LC_NUMERIC=C. A while ago part of this was fixed in OpenBabel but last time I checked many places (probably in file format plugins...) still had to be ported.

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420; Originator: NO. This should now be fixed in the 2.1 SVN branch, as of revision 1981 or later. The problem is that AtomIsChiral assumed that all atoms (including 3D) should have wedge/hash bond flags. This is not true for 3D files, of course. The revised code simply adds a test if the atom is part of a 3D molecule -- in which case it does not need to check bonds to the atom for wedge/hash flags.

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. Great. That looks really nice. I knew that you had done some work on it, but I didn't see it in the help on 'babel'. Regarding regular expressions, I just mean an asterisk. Often all the actives (e.g. in drug docking) would come from a different database (e.g. drawn by hand) than the inactives, and can be simply identified by common elements in their title. Would it be possible to use an expression like ""MY_FIRST_DATAFIELD>1.4 && MY_SECOND_DATAFIELD='NOT_IN_STOCK'"". I note that a possible problem is data fields that contain spaces in the names. I think that you will have to enforce some rules such as, if there's a space in the name, use an underscore in the query. It would be good also if babel warned if no field matched one of the terms in the query (and perhaps printed out some possibilities), as I imagine that this will be a common error.

So...were these two unrelated problems, or was openbabel genuinely unable to read these files...? I should try to convert 1ABE.pdb with babel.exe prior to the patch and see what happens...

Usability,"Please compare the above structure with the [pubchem 2D structure](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5761#section=2D-Structure), showing, in green, a H which 'protrudes towards the camera'. The same H is depicted as 'protruding' above the ring with the NCH3 group in [the wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide#/media/File:LSD-2D-skeletal-formula-and-3D-models.png). The Pubchem 3D shows the hydrogen in more detail. My point is that obabel's depiction of this molecule with the flags I used provides an image structure where this H 'protrudes' below the molecule, but in line with a C-C bond in the ring it is a member of, so you have both lines running in the same direction, one on top of the other, and although this may structurally possible, for the purposes of depicting the structure, it is less clear than the two references included above. Now this may be because I'm using obabel incorrectly, and if so, totally cool. But although I'm new to the notion of implicit and explicit hydrogens in the context of cheminformatics and 2D structure depictions, the flags I have used have hidden all the implicit hydrogens, but not the case H in point which appears to be nonetheless plotted, but in a way which is confusing, and irrespective, I was urged to log this as a bug by Geoff, so assumed it was therefore a bug. Therefore, I'm hoping that either; 1. Someone with authority admits this is a bug; 2. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me I'm using the wrong flags (and hopefully graciously corrects me) and obabel produces the same structure but with this H sticking out on its own or; 3. Someone suitably knowledgeable informs me that this is a feature of obabel, and irrespective of the flags, I will not be able to plot this H in such a way that it 'sticks out' without being plotted over another bond in which case, I can close this issue and use a different tool for those structures I have to plot where I find this anomaly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084:847,clear,clear,847,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1681#issuecomment-341712084,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"Re AWK: by default, one space, multiple free spaces, or a tabulator is all one white space. It is one argument e.g. to use [bioawk](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bioawk-tutorial) to process pdb and FASTA. One however can explicitly define (by `FS`) what AWK should consider as *field separator*, between the columns in a line (a *record*), and by `RS` what should separate the lines. (There equally are the variables `OFS` and `ORS` to specify *output field separator* and *output record separator*. Regarding the task ahead, however, I recommend to substantiate your question with a typical .sdf you want to process, to document the intended workflow, and output format you aim for.

Usability,"Referring to both comments, being a final degree project there were some time limits I had to stick to in order to finish it and make the changes (in about 3 to 5 months, including learning chemistry and understanding the base code from scratch). ; That's why we were not really considering to include too much external feedback, which could have made this process more complex. The project had specific goals, and in that time frame I came up with these solutions. I am by no means an expert in chemistry and my knowledge is quite scarce.; So you will probably find many things that can be improved, done in a more efficient way or better approaches that I might not have thought of.

Usability,"Thank you so much for looking into my problem!; I tried `obabel -ipdb ligand_1.pdb -h -opdb -O add_h.pdb` in my environment and it results as you described. It kept the original atom label and the residue name. While, there are still 2 problems about this:; 1. The `--p ph` flag and the python usage `mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(False, True, ph)` still do not keep atom label and residue name, which the ph will make big difference on the result. In my result with ph=7.0, the phosphates are all deprotonated and openbabel gives a good formal charge along with the connectivity. ; 2. Even in the way that keeps atom label and residue name, there's no different name for newly added Hydrogens. I looked into the naming rule of tleap in Amber and it is just simply adding element count after the element name. Like this:; ```; HETATM 59 H UNL 1 66.036 57.777 14.518 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 60 H1 UNL 1 69.447 60.888 17.041 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 61 H2 UNL 1 67.790 60.750 17.415 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 62 H3 UNL 1 72.206 58.616 13.563 1.00 0.00 H ; ```. I actually fixed my problem by writing a function in my workflow to fix the openbabel generated file (just count the element and give them new amber readable names.) ; Also I found some potential problems of the protonation function:; 1. The protonation will be plausible only when I start from a raw PDB without H and connectivity.

Usability,"Thanks for looking into this Tim. My own feeling is that there are two separate issues here:. 1. Can an atom with a hydrogen and a lone pair be stereogenic? This is related to stereocenter perception. Let me ping @johnmay on this. I'm pretty sure there are cases of this related to S (maybe not N), but I think John can clear this up.; 2. Should RemoveHydrogens() suppress hydrogens involved in cis/trans stereo? I think the answer to this is no. One of the invariants of the toolkit should be that suppressing and expanding hydrogens should not change any information. Note that (1) and (2) are separate issues. I've changed the SMILES reader so that stereo perception is optional (""-aS""). By default, stereo is just read directly from the SMILES (same behaviour as OEChem and CDK, at least). This improves performance when reading SMILES, and preserves stereo present in the input even where our stereoperception would remove it:; ```; $ obabel -:""C[C@](C)(C)C"" -osmi; C[C@](C)(C)C	; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396:320,clear,clear,320,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2111#issuecomment-572458396,1,['clear'],['clear']

I suppose I was low-key wondering how I was getting results, given that I didn't think MMFF94 supported radicals either, but the geometry guesses I looked at were fine for my application and I assumed obabel had some special way of handling these radicals. So I guess now I'm not sure what's going on, and why most radicals work (or ""work"") but the aforementioned one does not. For what it's worth, I don't actually need perfect geometries for my application because my next step is to feed them to a more accurate optimization. In fact for my purposes I could even obtain the geometry of the anion from obabel and let the more accurate optimization fine-tune the anion to the radical. So getting this perfect isn't immediately crucial to me but I am now curious what obabel is actually doing (and if you have a recommendation for the best way to process radicals in obabel to generate a good starting guess for a more accurate method, I'm all ears).

Usability,"Thanks, Noel. I agree that it's probably not a bug, although it does mean you are interpreting SMILES strings differently to Daylight, which may not be what people expect. Do you know how other software handles these H's?. For my original purpose, a better query would be something like [Nv2H1], which is unambiguous (obviously once the other bug has been fixed). Coming from a background where our compounds are (nearly) always stored as SMILES, I'd probably been using the Dn descriptor a little lazily. If you can (almost) guarantee no explicit H's, it's phenomenally useful for generating simple queries for e.g. primary amines, pyridones etc. that are independent of tautomeric / protomeric state.

Usability,"This is a DDL2 dictionary tag ; (symcif: http://oldwww.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/cifdic_html/2/cif_sym.dic/index.html), which current OB code does not fully support. As Geoff said that tag is not supposed to be computer-readable, so the supplied CIF files are actually incomplete. But the ""_space_group.transform_*"" tags which should be used instead are not handled by openbabel right now (reading them is one thing, but the spacegroup routines would have to take those into account). It would be so much simpler if the files always included the unique Hall symbol, ot the list of transforms... All this being said, the list in spacegroup.txt does include all the origin choices 1 and 2 (e.g. ""P 4/n m m:1"" and ""P 4/n m m:2""). So I have now added a hack in cifformat.cpp, so that when a HM symbol is found an the _space_group.IT_coordinate_system_code is equal to '1' or '2', the HM symbol is appended with ':1' or ':2', which is then correctly interpreted by the spacegroup routines.

Usability,"To be honest I kind of agree with you on the whole Dn thing - using queries that rely on explicit vs implicit H's does just sound like a bad idea. Perhaps I shouldn't have waxed quite so lyrical in my previous response. I have been caught out a couple of times even in a SMILES + Daylight environment - deuterated compounds being one example.... To answer your question, if you do make the assumption that all H's are implicit, then a query for a primary amine is as simple as [ND1][CX4], and you can capture both pyridone tautomers with [nD2]c~[OD1]. ""Dn"" becomes a synonym for ""is bonded to n heavy atoms"", which can come in very handy. But to reiterate, on reflection I think this is slightly sloppy querying on my part, and I certainly wouldn't suggest changing the way OB works just so that these queries work as expected. (Though I'd be interested to know how many other people use similar kinds of queries). I do think it would be worth finding out what some of the other major software vendors do with the H descriptor in a SMILES string though, even if this is just a matter of internal representation. To put it another way, if everybody else does it the same way Daylight does, is there a good reason OB is different?. Anyway, thanks for making me think this through a bit more rigorously!.

Usability,"What I'm trying to do is read in an arbitrary number of xyz files (thousands) each representing the reactants of a reaction. Then I have atom indices of the atoms that are involved in each reaction and I'm trying to generate a vector representation of each of those atoms using things like atomic #, # of connections, hybridization, and similar information of atoms it's bonded to. Then I aggregate the vector representations of the atoms involved in each reaction into a vector representation of each reaction as a whole. Then I use those reaction vector representations as data in a machine learning pipeline. Thanks @baoilleach, I tried keeping a reference to each reactants Molecule in my Reaction class (which I had been planning on doing anyway but hadn't remembered and hadn't needed to use yet) and that seems to keep all of the Atom instances valid at least in my initial tests involving what hadn't worked previously.

Usability,"Without working knowledge about the `.fasta` format, I simply provided a sequence like `ATCG`, requested to OpenBabel to convert this into a joined SMILES string (`-j`, or `--join`) and to write a `.sdf` for visual inspection in Jmol, too. The result is ambivalence. For one, the result already looks «DNA-like» in a ladder-like motif:. ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/116211601-831fc480-a733-11eb-8511-1cec5160032b.png). For the other side, the output is about _two_ molecules instead of the single one I anticipated. In the SMILES, this is marked by the dot laying on the floor; this syntax pattern is seen elsewhere, e.g., to describe co-crystals (presence of more than one molecule in a model, for example a remaining solvent molecule), too. So I speculate, this is / might be «common sense» for the typical user of `.fasta` files (which I'm not), not necessarily an error in OpenBabel.

Sorry, I feared that the one who programmed all the; complicated details of kekulize.cpp might take it as an; insult to be told about the location of double bonds in the; standard DNA base-pairs ;-). Anyway, here we go, looking at the attached kekubug.pdb:. Residue 630 is Guanosine. OpenBabel puts a double bond at; C2=N2, but it should instead be flipped over to C2=N3:; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate. There is this general rule that oxygens bound to aromatic; rings get a double bond if possible (i.e. if it doesn't kill; aromaticity), because the keto form is more stable than the; enol tautomer:; http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Keto_enol-tautomerism; (that's already handled well by OpenBabel). I think OpenBabel still needs to consider that nitrogens; bound to aromatic rings get a single bond if possible.; Couldn't find the theoretical justification for this; empirical rule, can anyone help?. Residue 631 is Cytidine, with essentially the same problem; again: The C4=N4 double bond belongs to C4=N3.; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine. Residue 632 is an unusual one where OpenBabel puts a double; bond at C1*=C5, which is impossible because C1* is clearly; sp3 hybridized and non-planar.; So both the C1*=C5 and N1=C6 double bonds should be single; bonds, with a C6=C5 double bond in the middle. BTW: I don't have an example now, but I saw the kekulizer; generate different results for the same residue type, i.e.; in PDB file 1ASZ every residue type appears multiple times,; but didn't always get the same single/double bond pattern.

Usability,"o the lack of documentation in the original OpenBabel code. It appears that the notions of ""implicit hydrogens"" and ""implicit valence"" aren't documented, and it seems to be used to mean different things depending on who was writing code, where the molecule came from, and where it's going. * In some cases, the number of hydrogens is assumed to be the ImplicitHydrogen count (regardless of whether there are other explicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle cases where an atom is not in its normal valence state, or where the element's valence is not obvious. Once the actual-hydrogen or actual-valence values is defined, the ""implicit valence"" and ""implicit hydrogen"" count functions can be rewritten as derived properties rather than fundamental properties, and ""implicit valence"" f",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888:1325,clear,clearly,1325,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Usability,"s to an eventual successful installation of openbabel with `pip install openbabel-wheel` from PyPI *instead* of the standard openbabel (and `pip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1078,simpl,simply,1078,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,1,['simpl'],['simply']

I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3).
