Integrability,"Hello @freeseek. It should be noted that you might be somewhat confused about what the -SO arguments do in the tools:; `-SORT_ORDER ""unsorted""` which has the help description `""The order in which the merged reads should be output. Default value: coordinate. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate, unknown}.""` For MergeBamAlignment that argument doesn't change how the input sort order is treated but rather is used to determine whether the tool will resort your reads before outputting them. Currently it looks like MergeBamAlignment requires queryname sorted inputs: `""Original SAM or BAM file of unmapped reads, which must be in queryname order. Reads MUST be unmapped.""` and will crash with the unhelpful message you encountered. It may be possible to loosen this restriction to queryname-grouped inputs (since it really primarily needs the mates adjacent to each other but not necessarily in readname order). The place to have this discussion would be here https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard since this tool is a picard tool that is called into by GATK and any changes would need to be approved by the maintainers of that repo..

Integrability,Hello @lindenb. . I think I found what is going on here and its a bug on our part that we didn't provide a better error for this issue. In the bed file you uploaded this is the offending interval:; `GL000223.1 178912 180554`; Unfortunately this is the length of that interval in the hg37 decoy sequence dictionary is as follows:; `@SQ SN:GL000223.1 LN:180455`; So it seems the issue here is that something got mangled and you are requesting a bad interval. It turns out we were using a codepath that failed to check that the interval was valid when specified as a bed file and active region padding code was using the correct interval based on the dictionary. This should be an easy fix on your end. I am making a branch that should trigger a better check and error message.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960:766,message,message,766,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960,1,['message'],['message']

Can you check your input `db_raw_call_bbe_6largest.vcf` for `\*` alleles?

Integrability,"Hey @jean-philippe-martin, this looks good. I've made some very small changes to avoid the back-and-forth of a review, and rebased the branch onto latest master. . The main change I made was in `IOUtils.getPath()`. It now traps the `IOException` and throws a `UserException` instead. This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not). Also made a small change in `NioBam` to make it use a logger instead of `System.out.println()` for debug output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2224#issuecomment-259798014:523,wrap,wraps,523,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2224#issuecomment-259798014,2,"['depend', 'wrap']","['depending', 'wraps']"

It just feels like there is a ton of boilerplate, the WDL/bash constructs are a bit hard to follow, and I'm sure the development cycles were pretty slow waiting for cromwell to spin up all those VMs, etc. An alternative would be to write all these validations as a python script, which could make better use of structure (ie authenticating once, etc) and I bet would be quite a bit more readable.

Integrability,"Hi @Neato-Nick @davidbenjamin . Apologies for posting this message here. I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs. I would appreciate if you could provide any feedback on this issue and/or if this behaviour has been observed by some other users also.

Integrability,"Hi @Nehir291, please refer to the SVAnnotate tool documentation for definitions of each annotation: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/21905053774363-SVAnnotate. For translocations, PREDICTED_LOF is assigned if a breakpoint falls at any point in the transcript, so an intronic breakpoint would still be annotated as PREDICTED_LOF for any impacted genes. This is because only part of the gene exists on each chromosome after the translocation, which is likely to result in a truncated transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. . Perhaps in some cases this definition is overly permissive, such as if only the UTR or one shorter exon is removed by the translocation - those cases could be worth revisiting. . I hope this helps explain the behavior you are seeing. If this does not fully explain all the PREDICTED_LOF annotations you are observing, please share the CTX breakpoints, the annotations, the SVAnnotate version, and the GTF used so we can investigate further.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147:530,mediat,mediated,530,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147,1,['mediat'],['mediated']
Integrability,"Hi @Vzzarr ,. Thank you for reporting this. I've never heard of this happening before, but I suspect the difference is that you are using maven and we've only ever used gradle. @magicDGS @LeeTL1220 You both build downstream projects, have you ever seen this?. From what I can tell `com.github.fommil.netlib.all` is a POM only dependency, but it's not annotated as such in our generated POM. Gradle resolves it correctly, and then resolves it's transitive dependencies correctly, but maven seems to resolve it differently. . I've reproduced the issue locally, and it seems like it can be fixed by changing this line in our build file:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/62e339fb9150db19f80d4b48aed8d47608461690/build.gradle#L220. to specify the exact dependencies we want instead of using the all artifact. I'll open a pull request with that. There's an additional catch though, you're using the latest release to maven central, which is actually a very old version. We haven't been able to release newer versions to central because they depend on a snapshot of a fork of a google library that isn't released to central. We publish these to our artifactory server which can be resolved like any other maven repository. Would you be able to work with an artifactory dependency? If you can you can A) use the newer and better gatk, B) I won't have to backport this change on top of beta.2 . We're going to fix the problem of not being in central eventually ( certainly before 4.0 release... ) but until then resolving from our artifactory is probably the best bet.

Integrability,"Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. . After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. . If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. . David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

Integrability,"Hi @hh1985 . Memory tuning is pretty tricky and can depend on a lot of things. How is your cluster configured? ; Are you using YARN? Are you running in client or cluster mode? . I'm assuming you're running with YARN. Mesos should also work but I don't have any experience configuring it. . BQSR should run safely with 4g of memory per core. (It should really work with much less I think, but 4 should definitely be sufficient.) There are a few different parameters that can help you adjust the memory ratios.; A good tuning might be something like; ; ```; --num-executors 5 ; --executor-cores 8 ; --executor-memory 32g ; ```. if you're not running with gatk-launch you'll need to set; ```; --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=600; ```; Without setting a higher than default yarn memory overhead like this we see consistent crashes, it's included in the settings gatk-launch applies already. That should run 5 separate executors with 8 cores each and give each one 32g, so 4g / core. . If you're running in cluster mode you'll have to carve out some memory and cores for the driver. You can set the driver settings with ; ```; --driver-cores 2; --driver-memory 4g; ``` ; or something along those lines. The driver doesn't need much memory or computer for BQSR.

Integrability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that.

Integrability,Hi @lucifer9288. Thanks for pointing this out as its a very confusing message. Its an oversight in our logging that causes that error message and it should not mean that your execution of SplitNCigarReads was invalid. The inflater in this message is referring to the fact that one of the compressed blocks gets uncompressed with zero output bytes which happens with the very last block of a properly formatted BGZF file (as a your input bam should be).

Integrability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:36,integrat,integrate,36,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,2,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integrate', 'interfaces']"

However, I experimented with tweaking the segmentation to work on the copy ratios (rather than the log2 copy ratios), which seems to recover them. Although one of the goals of having evaluations backed by SV truth sets is to tune such parameters/methods, I'm beginning to think that SV integration might benefit from using the CNV tools in a more customized pipeline---especially if maximizing sensitivity at resolutions of ~100bp jointly with breakpoint evidence is the goal. For example, you might imagine a tool that directly uses CNV backend code to collect coverage over regions specified by `-L`, builds a PoN, denoises, and segments on the fly.

Integrability,"I appreciate the desire for minimal changes, but I would point out that tying the VariantContext to the source FeatureInput is likely to be a somewhat common need for MultiVariantWalkers. I realize you have a lot of existing example that dont need this capability. While I started this using VariantEval/VariantQC, I more recently tried to port CombineVariants to GATK4 and hit a similar roadblock. I have one or two other lab-specific walkers that would benefit from using the iteration pattern of MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, but also need some ability to retain the FeatureInput->VariantContext link. I believe GATK3 retained this. It would be nice to at least make this a capability available to all MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart walkers. My suggestion above about making a FeatureInputAwareVariantContext wasnt necessarily meant to be introduced into every class.

Integrability,"I did, but then I rethought it and decided that I think it's too fragile to do it that way: You have to guarantee that all classes that might want to be registered are loaded and initialized before you instantiate the SparkConf. The problem is that it varies among JVM implementations exactly when that (class loading and initialization) happens. Some JVMs do the whole mess, chasing all references down from main recursively at the beginning, others are as lazy as possible and initialize only when actually traversing a reference for the first time. We could use that technique to ""inject"" a set of registrations into the GATKRegistrator from each main class. But since it's unreliable to do it in arbitrary classes, it seemed more straightforward to just let the normal object oriented method of overrides handle the problem, since it will need to be done only by direct subclasses, anyway. But I'm certainly open to other solutions, so long as we provide the functionality.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1767#issuecomment-214473964:584,inject,inject,584,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1767#issuecomment-214473964,1,['inject'],['inject']
Integrability,"I didn't realize before that there is no ""include"" (opt-in) validation type arg, only ""exclude"". So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:679,message,message,679,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"I don't think that hiding/disable arguments would work in every case: sometimes, an argument shouldn't be exposed but still available to set programmatically, or maybe just reduce visibility making it `@Hidden` and/or `@Advance`. What is the problem of making an interface for the top-level argument to the GATK? Changing the interface or the `CommadnLineProgram` has the same effect, but the API user can still behave the same as before. It is much more extensible and downstream-friendly. What's about making the `CLPConfigurationArgumentCollection` an interface always returning defaults to be able to change it in a proper way? The cycle of development of a new argument will be: 1) add a new method to the interface with a default returning what will be expected from the previous behaviour, 2) add and return by the argument in the GATK implementation, 3) use the getter in the CLP for perform the operation. This only adds the first point, and operating in 3 classes instead of 3. For API user it is really easy to maintain the previous behavior when upgrading the dependency by just using their own implementation of the class, or include the top-level new arguments by using the GATK implementation. It is much more flexible and extensible (I always think about GATK also as a library). In addition, I think that this approach is also important for evolving GATK. For example, if a new top-level argument is tagged as experimental (still not supported but requested in Barclay), removing it would allow to keep the interface (no version bump) the same and final users can still operate with the experimental argument. The same applies to the `GATKTool` base class (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341), and for downstream projects the aim should be to be able to extend safely the `CommandLineProgram` directly to implement their own toolkit using the powerful GATK framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003:263,interface,interface,263,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003,6,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependency', 'interface']"

Integrability,"I feel like this is going to be problematic in a different way than what @magicDGS is mentioning. We expect many versions of gatk to be compatible with the same python environment. Also for performance reasons we want to start avoid rebuilding the conda environment on every push and bake it into the base docker instead. This change means we definitely have to build it every time. . It feels like we need something more sophisticated. Instead of stamping the conda environment with the gatk version that matches it, maybe we should be stamping the gatk jar and the conda environment with some version based on the conda.env? Maybe we can do something like taking the md5 of the conda.yml and pushing that into both the jar manifest and the conda environment in some way? I'm guessing this scheme has an issue with the actual python code in the gatk since I think that's installed with conda as well?

Integrability,"I terms of comparing implementations in this particular instance, the entire BAM file is also being scanned, so there is no additional limitation in using Parquet. In general, though, there are some additional complications for typical Hadoop data sets due to their distributed nature. There are multiple methods for accelerating lookups, depending on the particular application and what kind of latency you need. A few of them:; - Data set partitioning in the style of Hive, where you split your data set into a directory hierarchy that's based on the values of one of the columns. This is like building an index, and should be done on cols that feature in lot of predicates. In the quince repo that we're using for ingest, we are partitioning the data based on genome locus. This makes it easy to access the data only from the locus of interest.; - Parquet supports predicate pushdown and column stats on its row chunks, so the more you homogenize the data (e.g., by sorting), the more likely it is you can skip large blocks of data.; - The parquet file format supports the concept of indexing (though I don't think it is implemented yet in any of the packages that read/write it); - For particular applications, you can also use a different storage backend like HBase or Kudu that allow very rapid point/range queries at scale. I believe GEL is planning on trying out HBase for some of their applications; - The Hammerbacher lab and the ADAM folks are also working on tools for BAM file indexing and visualization that scales on Hadoop.

Integrability,"I think @davidbenjamin is correct, that class does not produce unphased likelihoods but phased one. That is per se not a problem if they are handled appropriatelly down stream. . For example i think the Exact AF calculator does handle them as phased likelihoods. However many if not most of other usages may be wrong, for example the VCF output itself. The spec doesnt say whether the PL are phased or unphased or whether it would depend on whether the GT is phased or unphased itself. . It seems that we have been rather careless all this time as to how we were using those likelihood and we shall revise that. . In practice it only makes a difference with low signal/noise ratio data... perhaps this is the source or a source of bias against het calls if that has been observed in the past.

Integrability,"I think changes in 4.2.4.1 are exposing an issue, but I think @eriqande is right that the issue isn't with GenomicsDB. The change was that previously GATK wasn't correctly passing the `--max-alternate-allele` argument to GenomicsDB, but now that it is doing so it makes it more likely that some sites don't contain fields like PL (dependent on number of possible genotypes). It looks like the AF calculation used to ignore sites if they didn't have likelihoods, but has now been updated slightly to also allow sites with GQ or sites where any alleles are called+nonref+not symbolic. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/caa48f98c8207b688db6ee35fead3eafb7219e38/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/GenotypeUtils.java#L139-L141. Possibly that condition needs to be tweaked? @ldgauthier might be the best person to ask.

After all, we are only talking about metadata (hopefully in a standardized but suitably flexible format, e.g. SAM/VCF-style header) + tabular data. It may also be that there is a format out there that already fits the bill, in which case we just need to do some more research and discussion.

Integrability,"I tried to do it, and I'm afraid that it won't be trivial as I expected: because it is a facade, there is not accesibility to `Logger.setLogLevel()` and this is required to set the verbosity level in the command line. After explore a bit the code, it seems that [`LoggingUtils`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/LoggingUtils.java) is the only place where a concrete implementation should be used. My suggestion is to move this class to a package that could be excluded by the backend user (because it contains methods to change the logging of log4j, I suggest `org.apache.logging.log4j`), which implements a simple interface/abstract class `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.LoggingUtils` to set the log level (LoggingUtils.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`. The default implementation (that could be used by final users callid`super.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`) could setup the htsjdk and the java.util.logger.Logger. This implementation requires to change the `CommandLineProgram` to have a setter for the `LoggingUtils` to use, that could be set in `Main` (as in my PR for improve the extensibility of this class). The only pronblem is that it requires to be initialize with a simple implementation class of `LoggingUtils`, which should use the default. I think that this design does not break the behaviour of GATK, but introduce more complexity in the code.

Integrability,"I'm not completely opposed to that way of dealing with this, but I'm not yet convinced either. .

As for the documentation auto-generator showing the two args together, that is dependent on setting up the arguments so that the code specifies they are related, and adding some logic to the auto-generation to pull related arguments together. (As a contributing developer to a documentation auto-generator --the GATKDocs-- I can tell you that is not necessarily trivial and adds even more moving parts.) This also generates additional complexity for third-party developers of wrappers (such as Galaxy). Finally, it can be a source of confusion for users who are trying to look up an argument called ""-dont-Trim-whatever"" since presumably it's only going to be listed under T (-Trim-whatever) and not under D in the alphabetical list.

Integrability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now. As for workspaces with whole chromosomes -- there is no requirement or performance benefits to using whole chromosomes. As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace. I'm not sure if the blacklist regions contain any variants that start within but extend beyond the blacklist -- those may not show up if the regions are split up in this way.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1212486548:1253,depend,depending,1253,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1212486548,1,['depend'],['depending']

However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call).

But I'm not hitting this error. . @gmagoon any chance you could provide any more information that would help us reproduce this? The exact command line you're using might help. Do you still get the error if you run with an alleles file consisting _only_ of one of the pairs of given allele lines listed above?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5336#issuecomment-431865967:112,integrat,integration,112,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5336#issuecomment-431865967,1,['integrat'],['integration']

So, although there are other ways to do the formatting to get similar results, it would be at the expense of what I think would be increased code complexity. Also, I could have used ZonedDateTime in the IntegrationTestSpec code as well, but it was unnecessary.

Integrability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Integrability,"Is this the only `CommandLineException` which should be an `UserException`? If not, how is going to work the development of new exceptions in Barclay. For instance, in https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/pull/11 there is a new exception that I made for values out of range, which extends `BadArgumentValue`. I agree that this errors should be decoupled from the ones that are not, but in this case I think that this is already implemented:. * `UserException` are handled in the `mainEntry()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the user's side regarding some specifications in the tools/framework.; * `CommandLineException` are handled in `parseArgs()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the command line from the user side while parsing. I expect that any command line error that is not `CommandLineParserInternalException ` or `ShouldNeverReachHereException` comes from the user's side. The contract in Barclay says that are `CommandLineException` are _""Exceptions thrown by CommandLineParser implementations.""_, and I think that if other parts of the code (outside arg parsing) is throwing this exception is a bug that does not come from the user. I guess that this is the problematic part.; * Any other `Exception` is thrown in `Main.handleNonUserException()`, which may be caused by non-user exceptions. I propose that `CommandLineException` is handled as currently to separate ""errors that are the user's fault regarding input and/or assumptions"" (`UserException`), ""errors that are the user's fault while providing parameters to the command line"" (`CommandLineException`) and ""errors that are not the user's fault"" (other `Exception`s). Actually, this is reasonable because the exit status is different for any kind of errors in the current `Main`. The only problem that I see with this approach is the silently failing of a ""bug"" in tools/engine code, which can be rethrow easily in `CommandLineProgram.instanceMain`` as following:. ```java; public Object instanceMain(final Strin",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161:906,contract,contract,906,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161,1,['contract'],['contract']

When compared to DepthOfCoverage - ; - It uses multithreading (albeit only for deflation, so no performance gains when going beyond 4 threads).; - It gives coverage for exome within 5 minutes, and even faster when we don't need the per base coverage output.; - Per base coverage output can be skipped using ```-x``` the output of this matches closely to output from DepthOfCoverage. Do keep in mind, DepthOfCoverage also supports this skipping when using the parameter ```--omitDepthOutputAtEachBase``` which saves massively on I/O and cuts processing time from 50 minutes per sample to 40 minutes per sample. If you do decide to give it a try, we have some tips and suggestions - ; - The tool generates multiple output files. If looking for total coverage, check the last line of file ```output.mosdepth.summary.txt```; - If looking for percent of bases covered at target read depth, this information is present in file ```output.mosdepth.region.dist.txt```. If your target read depth is 20x, you can search this file with ```grep -P ""total\t20\t""``` and the third column should be the percentage (with only one decimal); - By using ```-d4``` switch, they claim the above percentage granularity increases to 4 decimal points.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071:126,depend,depending,126,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071,1,['depend'],['depending']

You design a function test_data_factory that takes as input either a known solution, or a set of parameters from which it can easily generate a known solution (by a route that is logically distinct from the way f_algo works). Then f_tester generates and returns test_data. The flow looks like; ```; // get either random test solutions or some distinct set that tests particular edge cases; test_params = get_test_params();; test_solution = easy_solution_from_params(test_params);. test_data = test_data_factory(test_params, test_solution);; assert f_algo(test_data) == test_solution;; ```; In some sense you've already done that, but you've personally stepped in as test_data_factory(), and I'm wondering if it would be possible to automate that to get rid of all those numbers in the test code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429:670,rout,route,670,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429,1,['rout'],['route']

There should probably be a preliminary QC step that checks that certain expectations are met before going ahead with the plotting, and returns some helpful troubleshooting info if not.

Integrability,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:1348,message,messages,1348,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"Need some guidance here. The CompareSAMs tool was not propagating the validation stringency. I have a fix for that, but that alone doesn't fix the compareBAMFiles test in BaseRecalibrationIntegrationTest.java, since that uses SamAssertionUtils.assertSamsEqual, which also doesn't propagate (or accept) a validation stringency. Changing SamAssertionUtils to use either SILENT or LENIENT does fix the integration test, and all the other tests pass, but it seems like a relaxing of the stringency, and I'm not sure it should be necessary to the BQSR test. If relaxing the stringency for BQSR test _IS_ the right path, one possibility is to add a new method to SamAssertionUtils that accepts a validation stringency argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266:399,integrat,integration,399,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"Nice that HTSJDK is moving forward to version 3. The points that I would like to address are similar to yours, with some inclussions. * Regarding NIO support, I would go to remove completely `File` support. If API users need to use the `File` abstraction, they should convert to a `java.nio.Path` using the `toPath` method.; * In addition, I would like that HTTP/S and FTP is handled also with NIO. For HTTP/S, I am working in a simple `FileSystemProvider` that should be good enough for using in combination with HTSJDK ([jsr203-http](https://github.com/magicDGS/jsr203-http)), and I can speed up the development there for needs in HTSJDK; for FTP, maybe [ftp-fs](https://github.com/robtimus/ftp-fs) can be used or a simple implementation can be derived from the HTTP/S implementation (without credentials). This will remove the special handling of HTTP/S and FTP paths in HTSJDK in favor of a consistent and pluggable manner.; * Interfaces for the data types are great, and maybe it will be good to have codec interfaces for both encoding and decoding. For example, I am missing encoders in tribble (an attempt in https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/822 for writing support).; * For VCF, I would like to have a less diploid-centric interface and design, or at least a way of configure the catching of genotype-related attributes. Currently there are methods for homozygotes/heterozygotes that aren't really useful for triploids or even VCFs without variation (for example, in Pool-Seq data).; * Modular design for artifacts: thus, a project with only SAM/BAM requirements will require only `htsjdk-sam`, and if they also want CRAM support, `htsjdk-cram`. See https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/issues/896 for more info about it.; * Common license for all HTSJDK, or at least for each module. This will be good for taking into account legal concerns when including the library, because now there is a mixture depending on the files that are used. This is what is coming to my mind now.

Integrability,"Not bad, but why can't the BAM be split as multiple objects in the same bucket where the directory is the name of the BAM. I was having this discussion with Dion at the following thread:. https://github.com/googlegenomics/utils-java/issues/62#issuecomment-220444203. You can have a folder in the GS location be the name of the BAM, and even sort them like a distributed B-tree. This way you can even simultaneously process reads as new data is streaming in from the GS location. Since the Google disk IOPS are as follows, based on the following link:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#type_comparison. | Read | Write |; | --- | --- |; | 3000 IOPS | 0 IOPS |; | 2250 IOPS | 3750 IOPS |; | 1500 IOPS | 7500 IOPS |; | 750 IOPS | 11250 IOPS |; | 0 IOPS | 15000 IOPS |. So it all depends on perspective of what folks prefer, which in this case means that we can minimize the 6 min component. Then comes the 1.5 min portion of HDFS, which can occur in parallel and could also be memory-mapped and/or SSD accessed. So there are still ways to improve the access and processing time, but it depends on how fast - or instantaneous - folks want to have the results processed and returned back.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1755#issuecomment-235130868:798,depend,depends,798,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1755#issuecomment-235130868,2,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"OK @droazen @davidbenjamin I think this is ready for review. Note that:. 1) I did not restore the optimization introduced by @davidbenjamin in #5466. Happy to file an issue to restore it later by adding the appropriate parameter check, if we think it's important.; 2) I only added integration tests for HC and M2, since there is only a minimal test for FilterAlignmentArtifacts at this time. But I would think that these tests are enough to show that the exposure preserves behavior (unless I somehow got extremely unlucky with the test data and parameter values...); 3) Apologies to the reviewer for the somewhat complicated commit history, which resulted from introducing/removing the TSV stuff and was more trouble than it might be worth to reorder/resolve in the final rebase. I think it would be easiest for the reviewer to look at the 4 ""bubbled up..."" commits separately when reviewing the exposure of each parameter set, but then look at the overall commit when reviewing more superficial things or the tests.; 4) I'd appreciate it if the reviewer double checked that I did not switch anything up in parameter names, doc strings, default values, etc. when introducing the 12 explicit args in AssemblyBasedCallerArgumentCollection. Lots of copying and pasting there and would be easy to screw things up, as you might imagine! Pretty sure the tests bear out that this was done correctly, but you never know.

Integrability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately. Here is the list of packages that get pulled in by the R install: ```autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils bsdmainutils build-essential; bzip2-doc cdbs cpp cpp-5 debhelper dh-strip-nondeterminism dh-translations; dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-5 gcc gcc-5 gettext gettext-base gfortran; gfortran-5 groff-base ifupdown intltool intltool-debian iproute2; isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libalgorithm-diff-perl; libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libarchive-zip-perl; libasan2 libasprintf-dev libasprintf0v5 libatm1 libatomic1; libauthen-sasl-perl libblas-common libblas-dev libblas3 libbz2-dev; libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libcroco3 libcurl3; libdns-export162 libdpkg-perl libencode-locale-perl libfakeroot; libfile-basedir-perl libfile-desktopentry-perl libfile-fcntllock-perl; libfile-listing-perl libfile-mimeinfo-perl libfile-stripnon",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954:90,depend,dependencies,90,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954,5,['depend'],"['depend', 'dependencies']"

Integrability,"OK, I think things are looking good! Updated a bunch of things, including the following:. - conda 23.1.0 -> 23.10.0; in the base Docker, also disabled conda auto-updating and set the solver to the much faster libmamba (NOTE: before this PR went in, this change was actually made in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610); - python 3.6.10 -> 3.10.13; - pymc 3.1 -> 5.10.0; - theano 1.0.4 -> pytensor 2.18.1; - added pytorch 2.1.0; - removed tensorflow 1.15.0 and other CNN dependencies; - added libblas-dev to the base Docker; I think MKL versions of all packages are being used, but we should verify!. These and other packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) are all pretty much at the latest available versions for python 3.10. I've also bumped version numbers for our internal python packages. I also made all of the changes to the gCNV code to accommodate any changes introduced by PyMC/Pytensor. For the most part, these were minor renamings of `theano`/`tt`/etc. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker.

Integrability,"OK. I found a potential solution. For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2. This means that we have only one GKL for both GATK 3 and 4, at the expense of having to keep to config files, `log4j.properties` and `log4j2.xml`, in sync (which they probably should have been anyway, thought they weren't).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413:89,depend,dependencies,89,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"OK. In GATK3, the sharding size is calculated in `GenomeAnalysisEngine.getShardStrategy`. Since `GenotypeGVCFs` is a RodWalker and does not use input reads (BAM file), the shard size is `1,000,000`. ; This might be more than a thread safety bug (which is easy to fix, by making `GenotypingEngine.calculateOutputAlleleSubset() ` `synchronized`). What worries me is If the cache of upstream deletions spans intervals, this code will not work since the processing is asynchronous. For example, if there are 2 threads and the removed deletion crosses the shard barrier and the downstream interval thread is first to process, it will not see the upstream removed deletion.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2326#issuecomment-270467197:329,synchroniz,synchronized,329,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2326#issuecomment-270467197,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronized']

Integrability,"One observation that illustrates the need for care when optimizing metrics: for a few of the F1 optimizations, the haplotype-to-reference match-value parameter gets driven to its minimal value (1). Not 100% sure, but I'm guessing this might effectively boost precision by somehow cutting down on the complexity of proposed haplotypes---it depends on what the exact behavior of our SW algorithm is for negative scores. @davidbenjamin any thoughts on this behavior?. Something I don't quite understand yet is if we can impose some effective constraints on the parameters or otherwise reduce the number of independent dimensions. For example, it seems reasonable to me to fix the gap-extend penalties to -1 and let all other parameters be defined w.r.t. them.

Integrability,"Rationale for engine changes:; This tool opens a large number of feature files (TSVs, not VariantContexts) and iterates over them simultaneously. No querying, just a single pass through each.; Issue 1: When a feature file lives in the cloud, it takes unacceptably long (several seconds, typically) to initialize it. A few seconds doesn't seem like a long time, but when there are large numbers of feature files to open, it adds up. This is caused by a large number of codecs (mostly the vcf-processing codecs) opening and reading the first few bytes of the file in the canDecode method. To avoid this I've reversed the order in which we test each codec, checking first if it produces the correct subtype of Feature, and only then calling canDecode. If you don't know what specific subtype you need, you can just ask for any Feature by passing Feature.class. It's much faster that way.; Issue 2: Each open feature source soaks up a huge amount of memory. That's because text-based feature reading is optimized for VCFs, which can have enormously long lines. So huge buffers are allocated. The problem is compounded for cloud-based feature files for which we allocate a large cloud prefetch buffer. (Though that feature can be turned off, which helps a little.) But the biggest memory hog is the TabixReader, which always reads in the index, regardless of whether it's used or not. Tabix indices are very large. To avoid this, I've created a smaller, simpler FeatureReader subclass called a TextFeatureReader that loads the index only when necessary. The revisions allow the new tool to run using an order of magnitude less memory. Faster, too.; Issue 3: The code in FeatureDataSource that creates a FeatureReader is brittle, and tests for various subclasses. To allow use of the new TextFeatureReader, I added a FeatureReaderFactory interface that allows one to ask the codec for an appropriate FeatureReader.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770:1832,interface,interface,1832,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770,1,['interface'],['interface']

The gCNV model is independently fit in each shard, using the global depth and contig-level ploidy parameters determined across the whole exome in the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy step. The shards are then stitched together in the PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls step. I believe we typically run shards of 10,000 intervals for cohorts of 100-200 samples using n1-standard-8 machines, which have 30GB of memory (although looking at some recent runs, I think we've used as few as 5,000 intervals per shard).

Integrability,"Some comments/questions for the review:; - I'll add a separate ticket to rewrite the integration tests, all of which pass and most of which are disabled since they require access to large files on the broad file system. In the meantime I need to add a couple of small tests to get the coverage back up, and would like to get the CR process started.; - I ported a bunch of support files but need feedback on whether they're in the right location.; - Somewhere I saw something that said GATK no longer supports .ped files ? If not, what should the replacement be in the tests require pedigree input?; - Is it a requirement to support Ploidy > 2 ? The current GATK tool, and thus the HB tool, do not; - I did not port the WalkerTestSpec.disableShadowVCF? Is that needed in Hellbender ?; - Are there other headers I should be applying to the output variant file ?. Command Line Arguments:; - I didn't port the GATK command line argument ""-no_cmd_line_in_header"". Should I ? And if not, should the command line args automatically be propagated to the output vcf file ? I didn't see GATK do this anywhere.; - There was one test that used --variant:dbsnp on the command line but I couldn't find the code that processed that in GATK, not sure what the means on the command line.; - I replaced ""-U LENIENT_VCF_PROCESSING"" with ""--lenient"" (testFileWithoutInfoLineInHeaderWithOverride needs this to pass).; - I replaced ""-L"" with --interval since HB seems to use -L for ""lane"" ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/792#issuecomment-128798027:85,integrat,integration,85,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/792#issuecomment-128798027,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"Thank you @kshakir. What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504:310,message,messages,310,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504,3,"['message', 'wrap']","['message', 'messages', 'wrap']"

Integrability,"Thank you @mehrzads for your contribution. It would appear that this optimization is aimed to incorporate the knowledge that we could never possibly visit a given vertex more than K times in the first K best paths. Since the graphs are prone to exponential expansion of paths this seems like an important safeguard against this exponential expansion of the graph. . Looking at the code and the algorithm behavior it is intending to copy I see that there is a degenerate case in the current code that can cause the results to be order dependent. My belief is that this code can fall over by virtue of the fact that we refuse to make new incoming edges to a given vertex if there are already too many incoming edges for that vertex. Unfortunately this heuristic doesn't strike me as being valid, because those incoming edges can have any weight, including very high weights because they are bad paths through the graph that we created at a previous step. . I think a more correct optimization would be to limit the number of edges we create LEAVING a given vertex. The logic for this is that while we may not necessarily see all of the incoming edges in the correct weight order we will necessarily see all of the leaving edges in the correct order because those paths are pulled off of the priority queue in the correct order. Thus we can safely ignore any additional paths we see leaving a given edge because by construction as they would necessarily have at least one path that is cheaper than all of the paths leaving the current node.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417:534,depend,dependent,534,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"Thank you @vruano for your diligent review. I've implemented logger classes to encapsulate the metrics classes. Unfortunately the metrics classes must remain public in order to write output using `MetricsUtils.saveMetrics()`, but at least the tools aren't using them directly. There are two logging class groups - one for Filter and one Score. For Filter, there is an interface `PSFilterLogger` that is implemented by a file-logging class `PSFilterFileLogger` and a dummy class `PSFilterEmptyLogger` that does nothing. There are analogous classes for Score, but there is no Empty logger because it's not actually necessary. This adds a lot of new classes (maybe you can think of a better way) but usage has been greatly simplified. As we discussed in person, I don't think there is a faster way to count the reads in Spark. If you wanted to count the reads as they pass through, you would have to use some kind of atomic type that would be slow. Also it may be impossible to account for cases when tasks fail and restart. @lbergelson @droazen In this PR, I wanted to use htsjdk's MetricsFile and MetricBase classes for writing metrics to a file. I notice that these classes are mostly used for picard-related things. Is this the preferred way to do things?

Integrability,"Thanks @davidbenjamin. . For what it is worth, here are some of my thoughts. From my perspective, it might helpful to separate the discussion into read likelihood calculation and the genotype likelihood calculation. As I understand it, sequencing error is directly relevant to the pairHMM read likelihood calculation. I guess the location where PCR error is most relevant (read likelihood vs genotype likelihood) would depend on whether the read likelihood is computing a ""fragment likelihood"" (the likely DNA sequence of the fragment being sequenced) or a ""haplotype likelihood"" (the likely source haplotype for the fragment being sequenced). In any case, as I see it, this particular issue could be interpreted as a shortcoming in only the HaplotypeCaller genotype likelihood calculation, and it would essentially be an issue of double counting. So I'm not sure that a quick fix for this issue is necessarily off the table...Maybe something like one of the following could be used just before or during the genotype likelihood calculation:; - something like `filterOverlappingReads` from Mutect2 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/mutect/SomaticGenotypingEngine.java#L326); - separate consideration of overlapping reads when calculating genotype likelihoods, as used in UnifiedGenotyper (https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk-protected/blob/aa8764d6c3de146856b174a8674fa787a6311d7c/protected/gatk-tools-protected/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/tools/walkers/genotyper/DiploidSNPGenotypeLikelihoods.java#L183). As I see it, #4958, which seems to be more related to read likelihood calculation, is where a more involved solution, with more fundamental changes, might be warranted. From my perspective (not being especially familiar with the pairHMM model), an ideal solution would transition the pairHMM from read likelihood to a ""fragment likelihood"" or ""haplotype likelihood"" when information from read pairs is available,",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420:419,depend,depend,419,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"Thanks @droazen & @ldgauthier. I can certainly run a bunch more iterations of the same HC run on the same data. I'm not super hopeful it will turn anything up though. I can also try selecting a bunch of the different PairHMM implementations. I can't share too much, but this issue turned up in a very high throughput (1000s of samples a day) clinical pipeline. We're going back and looking for other instances where we see an excess of that `Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null` message, and re-running those samples to see if, on re-run, they generate different outputs. I realize the AVX-specific hardware issue is perhaps a little far-fetched, though given the volume of the pipeline and the fact that it runs in a cloud environment, I think it's entirely reasonable to suspect we'll run into hardware/instance issues occasionally. And there are AVX or at least SIMD specific registers, so if one of those were to see problems that could cause the PairHMM issues, without causing issues in other software that doesn't leverage the SIMD/AVX instructions. My main question really is this: is anyone familiar enough with the Intel PairHMM implementation and interface that they could weigh in on whether or not unexpected hardware errors could result in the return of empty likelihoods from the PairHMM instead of some kind of error, exception or segfault?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915:532,message,message,532,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915,2,"['interface', 'message']","['interface', 'message']"

Integrability,"Thanks @droazen. Because you assigned it to me, I would like to know a couple of details on how this should be implemented in GATK4:. * GATK3 use to have a the `MisencodedBaseQualityReadTransformer` always on, with a switch for checking/fixing the qualities. If we follow this approach in GATK, the only change for this is to include the checking step every n reads and then #2160 will do the rest. Nevertheles, I think that it's quite dangerous to allow an user to disable it with the plugin (because the name suggest that it is only fixing the qualities), so I suggest to integrate in the read data source an iterator for checking every x reads if the qualities are misencoded, independently on the transformer.; * GATK3 throws an UserException for ""putatively misencoded"" qualities, using 60 as maximum base quality for throwing. I think that in the case of GATK4 could be more useful to use a warning if it is over 60 (I do not know what is the reasoning behind this value), and use `SAMUtils.MAX_PHRED_SCORE` for throwing.

You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class.

Integrability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

Integrability,"Thanks a lot for looking into this @sooheelee - I understand the pain of making the small data for the tests, so I really appreciate your work there. I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1. Looking a bit into the code of GATK3, there is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1.

This is Novaseq 2 x 150 data, I ran Fastqc on the reads and everything looks really good, the only thing I can find that might explain the soft-clipping is that there's some Nextera adapter read through on a small percentage of the reads. I haven't been using -Y with bwa (I see it's used in GATK 4 wdls), so it seems like there should be less soft-clipping than normal. I'll admit these are definitely messy regions we're dealing with, but we really need to make the F5 calls for our clinical pipeline.

Integrability,"Thanks for making this change! I might include more detail with the note (""Substantially improves results on FFPE samples""), for posterity---it's probably true, but we can't really say anything definitive with only N=1 and without the cross-validation procedure I mentioned on Slack. That is, the higher degree of denoising might just be an artifact of effectively removing more PCs with GC-bias correction (since I'm assuming the same number of PCs were explicitly removed in both cases), but it's possible that removing the optimal number of PCs without GC-bias correction could achieve a better result. Since our correction procedure is relatively naive, there may also be some dependence on bin size. However, I think it's probably not worth a detailed analysis, and that it's generally safe to enable correction by default.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5966#issuecomment-496933928:681,depend,dependence,681,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5966#issuecomment-496933928,1,['depend'],['dependence']
Integrability,"Thanks for taking a look @davidadamsphd. Regarding the singleton pattern, by the looks of things it was introduced for testing with the intention of avoiding the 10+ second overhead of creating the reference table, however `RefAPISourceUnitTest` still builds the table in `queryReferenceAPI` for each test. We could avoid that by using TestNG's `@BeforeClass` to create the `@RefAPISource` just once, as I mentioned above. Otherwise, the API is not called in tests, since a mock `ReferenceDataflowSource` is used. Let's work out a common references interface - @jean-philippe-martin and @akiezun, let me know what you prefer here.

Just as a side note (and I'm not sure if you would be interested in this), but the reason I've been digging so deeply into HaplotypeCaller behaviour is that we've been working on a rust based reimplementation of the HaplotypeCaller but geared towards metagenomic analysis. So the interface is more geared for handling many genomes all in parallel as well as adding in a bunch of metrics that microbiologists would find useful: https://github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet/tree/dev & https://github.com/philipc/gkl-rs.

Integrability,"Thanks for the response, @droazen! Technically, yes, that would be satisfactory & accurate... and if that's easiest, I'm fine with that. . From a user perspective though, it might be beneficial to report the first occurrence of this error, as that's most likely where I would go back to do future testing & troubleshooting. That being said, all of the overlapping intervals are already outputted to stderr, so all the information is retained regardless, and I could just look through the logs to find that first problematic interval. As an aside, I find it a bit weird that the overlapping interval message shows up as a _warning_ even when using the `-no-overlaps` option (I would assume it would be an error, not a warning). In my experience, most errors cause the program to quit immediately. So, perhaps instead, if this warning were an _error_ when using the `-no-overlaps` option, the program would stop after the first occurrence of this error... and then the error message would be accurate. Maybe that was the original intent of this code. But, again, if that requires much more testing & changes, when a quick rewording would also suffice, there's no need.

Integrability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

My ideas about the ordering are the following: in #2084, I have the implementation of the fixing/checking of misencoded quals included in the read sources. So the only one that could be applied before filtering is gone if you accept that PR. Thus, I guess that the transformer could be applied after the filtering. Because transformers could be kind of demanding in computation, it will be interesting to pass directly to them filtered reads. In addition, could be included in the contract that only valid reads for the tool ensure that the read transformers don't blow up.

Integrability,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later. Job 5 *is* doing a lot of computation. It's turning each read into kmers and testing each of those kmers to see if they exist in a large hash table.

Integrability,"Thanks, but I’m still not sure I understand. Haplotypecaller has the following parameters:. . Assembly-region-padding. Interval-padding. . The differences and relationships between these are not well documented on the gatk website. From what you describe below, it would seem to suggest that assembly-region-padding is doing what interval-padding is doing. But then why would there be multiple settings for the same thing?. . I just want to make sure that Assembly-region-padding is indeed adding intervals to the -L interval list itself, not just to the assembled regions. .

This is controlled by the --assembly-region-padding argument, which defaults to 100 bases on either side. Note that this controls both padding around user-provided intervals, as well as padding around each individual assembly region that the HaplotypeCaller discovers. Typically a single user interval will get divided into many assembly regions, depending on where variant activity is located. —; You are receiving this because you were mentioned.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6071#issuecomment-517387946:1346,depend,depending,1346,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6071#issuecomment-517387946,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"That is a separate matter altogether from both 1) unifying the allele-count collection tools, and 2) standardizing the format of tabular data. The most appropriate place for integration of Mutect2 SNV calls would be as input to the tumor-heterogeneity tool (along with the ModelSegments output) further downstream. This is because it is unlikely that including the SNVs as input to ModelSegments would significantly improve either segmentation or modeling there. If the allele-count collection tools are unified, I think that the only redundant work done across both pipelines would be the calling of hets from the pileups, which is extremely cheap. However, we should certainly also unify the code to do this (which I've spoken to @davidbenjamin about as well).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926:174,integrat,integration,174,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"That's why I am not using in ReadTools and other developmental toolkit the base class from GATK, due to the polluted command line with unused arguments. I think that for give flexibility, some of that arguments should be configurable by extending classes. For example, some tools that does not require reads at all should be able to turn off the read arguments. That will be very useful, although I am not sure how to do it in a proper way without adding more and more interfaces for argument collections. In context case of this PR, I think that adding it does not have any real effect on the GATK codebase, and a lot is gained by downstream projects. For example, if the wrapper script adds another argument that should be parsed in `Main` and documented, the GATK team just add it to its class.

Integrability,"The advantage of using SLF4J is that it is a general facade, so it makes simpler to change for one logging system to other if the bound is implemented. For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general. Regarding features, I'm not using more that what log4j is providing, but I'm quite familiar with logback and I have a bias to use it if possible, but the GATK framework as it is implemented now ""force"" to use log4j.

Looking at the source for `RecalibrationTables` it looks like it's probably `readGroupTable`, since it is the only 2D table I can see in `allTables`. So the question becomes, why is the number of read groups different for different tables created by `BaseRecalibratorSparkFn`? They all have the same header, so the number of read groups should be the same. One thing to try to see if it affects the result is to set a different partition size with `--bam-partition-size`.

Integrability,"The right way to approach this ticket is not to make a huge change that requires a massive amount of work across both our codebase and our dependencies, but instead to make a targeted fix that addresses the original bug. If we want to support zero-length intervals, that should be a separate ticket, as it's a non-trivial task to do correctly. I'll add: unless the semantics of using zero-length intervals are precisely defined in every case, we should probably not allow them. Eg., what should happen when you query using a zero-length interval? Should you always get back nothing, or should you get back abutting records? How does overlap work?

I'm not sure if you mean incremental import or batch size when you mention the iterative approach. I assume the latter, but just want to clarify that there isn't any reason to break up the import using incremental import. The batch size parameter effectively does that, so you might as well import all gVCFs you have available (optionally using batch size if you're running out of memory). I'll throw out batch sizes of 50 or 100 as being reasonable, but the size of the intervals being imported will make a difference. It would be best to try to monitor how much memory is being used with those settings.

Integrability,"This error message is related to GATK's ability to load files on Google buckets (""gcs://bucket/file.bam""). This ability is enabled even when running locally (this aspect is intentional, because it's useful to be able to run a local GATK instance to process remote data without having to fire up a VM). As the bucket-reading code (""NIO"") initializes, it looks for credentials to use. Those can be set via an environment variable or via `gcloud auth`, as described in GATK's README. If neither of these are set, it checks whether it's currently running in a Google virtual machine (so it can figure out who owns the virtual machine that it's running on, and use those credentials). Apparently this code throws an exception if it runs out of ways to find credentials, and our code prints it out and moves on. The message is useful, for if we *were* running in a google VM and the credential-finding failed, we'd certainly like to know.

E.g., all missing, zero variance. Future work:. - [ ] We could allow subsetting of annotations here, which might allow for easier treatment of ill-behaved annotations. However, I'd say enabling workflows where the set of annotations is fixed is the priority.; - [ ] We could do positive-unlabeled training more rigorously or iteratively. Right now, we essentially do a single iteration to determine negative data. This could perhaps be preceded by a round of refactoring to clean up model training and make it less procedural.; - [ ] Automatic threshold tuning could be built into the tool, see #7711. We'd probably have to introduce a ""validation"" label. Perhaps it makes sense to keep this sort of thing at the workflow level?; - [ ] In the positive-negative framework enforced by the Java code in this tool, a ""model"" is anything that assigns a score, we fit two models to different subsets of the data, and then take the difference of the two scores.

Integrability,"Two high level questions/concerns about the implementation… . 1. I think when things are parallelized, we then lose the retries. In order to do that, we might need to get a little more python async-y than I was originally thinking. The retries are pretty important to recover from transient errors in BQ. 2. I think perhaps the ordering/dependecies are lost between queries? It looks like we fire them all off and then wait for them all to complete. But really we need to wait for the vet_new queries to finish before launching the pet queries since they depend on data from the vet_new.

This internal exception class should not be usable outside of barclay (perhaps we can make it package-private?).; * Catch `CommandLineException` in GATK and present it as a user error (output should say ""A USER ERROR HAS OCCURRED"").; * Move the `printDecoratedUserExceptionMessage()` call for caught `CommandLineExceptions` from `CommandLineProgram.parseArgs()` to `Main.mainEntry()`, to ensure that a message always gets printed for `CommandLineException`.

Integrability,"Wow, thanks for the detailed comments so far, @davidbenjamin! But perhaps let's quickly chat before you go any further?. There are a lot of things you commented on---temporary integration tests using local files, lots of code/arguments/etc. intentionally copied verbatim over from VQSR/tranches, and entire tools (the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain)---that are rather in flux or will be scrapped/cleaned up shortly. That said, the comments on the code inherited from VQSR will certainly be useful in this process!. But it might save you some time if we could chat so I can give you a rough orientation and perhaps point out where the vestigial VQSR code remains. I think focusing discussion on the high level design of the tools that are likely to stay would also be most useful at this stage. Feel free to throw something on my calendar!. In the end, I think we will probably just retain the BGMM backend + the versions of the tools in the ""scalable"" package. I left the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain tools in this branch so I could do one round of tieout. That tieout came out OK, so I think we'll abandon the monolithic tools, along with all the associated code outside of the scalable package.

Integrability,"Yes, Hadoop-BAM uses the NIO API to do file merging, whereas in GATK we were using the Hadoop APIs (and therefore the GCS<->HDFS adapter) to do it. It looks like there are a couple of things needed in GCS-NIO to use the NIO API for this.; 1. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/1450 so that we don't have to special-case `gs` URIs to remove everything except the scheme and host when looking up the filesystem (see https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L40); 2. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/813 to support path matching (https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L90).

Integrability,"Yes, that seems to be working as intended.

Therefore, when you set N >= 3, the behavior is the same as when N = 2. In your second log, only one iteration goes by before we refit again. This refit yields posteriors that are sufficiently different from the approximation used when no refitting is performed so that additional smoothing needs to be performed before convergence. You'll see that in the second case, we end up with fewer segments.

Integrability,"Yup, as you might recall from some discussions with @bhanugandham and @mwalker174, getting automated pipeline-level CNV evaluations up and running was highest on my list before I handed over the role and went on paternity leave. I think these tests would be more useful than unit/integration tests for correctness, but they would almost certainly have to run on CARROT. That said, the current level of unit/integration test coverage is a bit different from that for the somatic tools, because 1) it's difficult to run gCNV in any useful way on Travis infrastructure, and 2) we hadn't decided on a framework/convention for python unit tests at the time the production code went in (although I think @ldgauthier has added some python unit tests by now). So we currently only have plumbing WDL/integration tests on very small data for gCNV---and these only test that the tools run, not for correctness. For somatic CNV, we have unit tests for correctness on small simulated data (e.g., for things like segmentation and modeling classes), but integration tests don't cover correctness (and it would be pretty redundant to use the same simulated data for integration, so I'd rather put effort towards pipeline-level tests on real data).

Integrability,"and likely to require some iteration so I'd be ok with starting with just the minimal ""porting"" changes to keep things simple, and then doing a code hygiene pass at the end. The ""porting"" changes should include things like updated javadoc, GATK4-style command line arguments, updating of outdated GATK3 terminology such as ""ROD"", Utils.nonNull assertions, etc. The finals and curly braces can wait for a separate pass (we will want to do those in this PR though). If you're not sure what to include or not just ask. I like the idea of keeping the GATK3 tests working as we go along. We should make a clear distinction between the old and new tests though. Ideally the GATK3 tests would be in a separate commit that we can just delete at the end, but that can get unwieldy if the files in the commit need to change as we go along. Alternatively you could isolate them into a separate directory. They should either be disabled or made dependent on a test method (see the `@Test` annotation properties `enabled` and `dependsOn`) that is easily toggled so they can be run locally, but don't run on the CI server. Otherwise the CI server build will always fail. In general, its really helpful to have the first commit in the PR contain the completely unmodified GATK3 source files. It makes it much easier for the reviewer to see what changed for the port. I noticed that you have 2 new plugins included in this. I'm not sure if that was suggested by someone on the GATK team (I'm wondering if we want to go down that path...) but I can tell you that the existing plugins required an enormous amount of test development and review iteration. If we do decide to make them plugins, I think it would be a good idea to do so in a separate PR. Also, if we choose to make an AbstractPlugin base class, we may want that to live in the Barclay repo. As @magicdgs points out, master already has your previous commits, so you should start by rebasing on that.

Integrability,"ations are described as early as [VCF v4.1 specs](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/) and expanded upon in v4.3 specs. I think @jonn-smith you refer to MAF-format functional annotations. Yes? Here we are discussing much less complex variant call level annotations like genotype that would have a few associated numerical values, e.g. 10th, 50th, and 90th confidence interval allele fractions AND copy ratio value for each CN segment. . One last thing of interest towards visualization. I've been reminded recently of some open-source software that is a standard in visualizing somatic data for the biologist in the Cancer Genetics field--[CBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/index.do?cancer_study_id=blca_mskcc_solit_2014&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&data_priority=0&case_set_id=blca_mskcc_solit_2014_cnaseq&gene_list=RB1%2520RBL1%2520RBL2%2520CCNA1%2520CCNB1%2520CDK1%2520CCNE1%2520CDK2%2520CDC25A%2520CCND1%2520CDK4%2520CDK6%2520CCND2%2520CDKN2A%2520CDKN2B%2520MYC%2520CDKN1A%2520CDKN1B%2520E2F1%2520E2F2%2520E2F3%2520E2F4%2520E2F5%2520E2F6%2520E2F7%2520E2F8%2520SRC%2520JAK1%2520JAK2%2520STAT1%2520STAT2%2520STAT3%2520STAT5A%2520STAT5B&geneset_list=+&tab_index=tab_visualize&Action=Submit&genetic_profile_ids_PROFILE_MUTATION_EXTENDED=blca_mskcc_solit_2014_mutations&genetic_profile_ids_PROFILE_COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION=blca_mskcc_solit_2014_cna) (I plugged in some data--try clicking on the different tabs). They are Dockerized and their repo is at https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal. They do a good job bridging the gap between genomics data and what the biologist is interested in. Their CNA visualization currently takes GISTIC-type data. For segmented CNs, they use a JavaScript version of IGV.

Also, added the possibility of sample-specific unexplained variance in the germline contig ploidy model; ; updated I/O routines and CLIs according to team discussion; ; updated I/O routines and CLIs according to team discussion; ; changed the output layout of the ploidy determination tool; refactored parts of io.py; upped the version to 0.3 as it is not backwards compatible anymore; ; case ploidy determination tool from a given ploidy model; major code cleanup and refactoring of I/O module; refactoring of common CLI script snippets; ; removed all ""targets""; some code cleanup; ; pad flat class bitmask w/ a given padding value in the hybrid q_c_expectation_mode; option to disable annealing and keep the temperature fixed; ; bugfix in finite-temperature forward-backward; further refactoring of model I/O; ; the option to take a previously trained model as starting point in cohort CLI; the option to take previous calls as a starting point in cohort CLI; ; option to save and load adamax moments; ; import/export adamax bias correction tensor; ; refactoring related to fancy opt I/O; added average ploidy column to read depth; updated docs of hybrid ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3925#issuecomment-354805598:10911,rout,routines,10911,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3925#issuecomment-354805598,2,['rout'],['routines']
Integrability,"c. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285:1955,integrat,integration,1955,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"consider combining this code (along with `AllelicCount`/`PileupSummary`) at some point.; - [x] Added option to use matched normal.; - [ ] Rather than port over the old modeling code, I would rather expand the allele-fraction model to allow for the modeling of hom sites. I wrote up such a model in some notes I sent around a few months back. This model allows for an allelic PoN that uses all sites to learn reference bias, not just hets. Depending on how our python development proceeds, I may try to implement this model using the old `GibbsSampler` code instead.; - [x] In the meantime, we can try to speed up the old allele-fraction model, which is now the main bottleneck. An easy (lazy) strategy might simply be to downsample and scale likelihoods when estimating global parameters. Addresses #2884.; - [x] Even though the simple copy-ratio model is much faster, it still takes ~15-20 minutes for 100 iterations on WGS, so we can downsample here too.; - [x] Integration tests are still needed; again, these might not test for correctness.; - I've added the ability to specify a prior for the minor-allele fraction, which alleviates the problem of residual bias in balanced segments.; - I've reduced the verbosity of the modeled-segments file. I only report posterior mode and 10%, 50%, and 90% deciles. Global parameters have the full deciles output in the .param files, but I removed the mode and highest density credible interval (because of the below item).; - [x] Some residual bias remains in the estimate of the minor-allele fraction posterior mode. This is simply because we are performing kernel density estimation of a bounded quantity. One possibility would be to logit transform to an unbounded support, perform the estimation, then transform back. EDIT: Just removed kernel density estimation for now, partly due to #3599 as well.; - Hmm, actually still a tiny bit of residual bias. This is apparent e.g. in WGS normals.

Integrability,"d=33414234, featureStartFilePosition=1403632876, featureEndFilePosition=-1})``. This is has something to do with your input file. If I am wrong and this is truly a code error, then the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. @lbergelson Can you confirm? . > Also, why @LeeTL1220 have you changed the title of this issue ticket? Can you please explain? Again, I reiterate that CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics works just fine. It is FilterByOrientationBias that errors without these workarounds. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (GATK version) definitely does not work just fine. I've cited the issue above. I do not think that any of the code fixes would actually go into FilterByOrientationBias. If the GATK version worked just fine, we would ditch the ``sed`` command and use that. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (Picard version) works just fine BUT it introduces that string which requires the ``sed`` statement. If you do not use ``sed``, a (general-use/engine) dependency of ``FilterByOrientationBias`` will try to instantiate a class that does not exist. The ``sed`` was supposed to be temporary until picard was wrapped properly in GATK. But until then, it does mean that all GATK-based downstream dependencies of ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` will fail without the sed. Again, the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. > Also, FilterByOrientationBias does not output bgzipped VCFs. So this is not in line with how GATK tools should work. . ``FilterByOrientationBias`` just farms it out to a VCF Writer. That dependency (VCF Writer) should handle that. Can you confirm, @lbergelson ? Is there an additional step to make this work that I did not know about?. > Again, FilterByOrientationBias is not production worthy and I think at this point it should get an experimental or BETA label. Only because of the ``sed`` nonsense, as near as I can tell. Definitely, BETA -- not experimental. All I'm saying is that I don't believe any code change needs to go into ``FilterByO",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3030#issuecomment-306525143:2017,depend,dependency,2017,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3030#issuecomment-306525143,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Integrability,"e GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of managing that woul be a new field in the CLP consisting on an interface/abstract class, `CommandLineStartupFormatter`, with the same CLP methods for this kind of operations, that will be passed to the CLP on construction (in `Main`) and defaults to whatever base class is chosen. This will allow custom toolkits to override in their `Main` the formatter and thus make consistent the output of every tool. Another option is to use directly something like the Spring framework, but I think that it is quite complicated for API users without knowledge of Spring (like me).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:2301,interface,interface,2301,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"e canonical name for this metric actually is, but it doesn't appear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use. For example, in malaria, it looks like we may have to resort to using a callset that has been very conservatively filtered as truth, which will bias us towards high scores and the peaks of the positive distribution. Perhaps we can also experiment with just treating training/truth on an equal footing (I think the distinction between the two is somewhat blurry in the original VQSR design, anyway). Perhaps @davidbenjamin has some thoughts? I see some related stuff going on in ThresholdCalculator, but I have to admit that I can't tell whether that's used in a similar PU context. Also note that depending on the model used, we might not have well calibrated posteriors---the IsolationForest simply outputs scores in a unit interval, and we simply report the differe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241:1716,depend,dependence,1716,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241,1,['depend'],['dependence']

Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and complexity of the header tag might also depend on the ; execution environment. If the execution environment only supports a ; small finite number of headers, the header tag could be a small integer, ; or in a different execution environment it could be; a unique hash of the header or something like that. Memory footprint in ; the receiver is minimized because many SAMRecords can all share the same ; header object.; This requires more work to support in each execution environment, but it ; seems like it could be efficient and allows application code written to ; operate on SAMRecords to be portable; across different execution environments without having to contend with ; the possible presence of headerless SAMRecords. -Bob.

Integrability,"endencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests).

Integrability,"ergelson please comment on the following proposal. The proposal is that we would spin off native PairHMM as a separate project/repo on github and host AVX code there and have alternative implementations extend that project/repo (by creating repos that depend on the AVX one). . In other words, now we have 1 repo, broadinstitute/gatk. After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one). The avx and ppc repos will have their own build systems and unit tests against the new interface. The AVX repo will expose something like the following Java API (to be worked out in detail). ```; //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from reads; public final class JNIReadDataHolderClass {; public byte[] readBases = null;; public byte[] readQuals = null;; public byte[] insertionGOP = null;; public byte[] deletionGOP = null;; public byte[] overallGCP = null;; }. //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from haplotypes; public final class JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass {; public byte[] haplotypeBases = null;; }. public interface NativePairHMMKernel extends AutoCloseable { . /**; * Function to initialize the fields of JNIReadDataHolderClass and JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass from JVM.; * C++ code gets FieldIDs for these classes once and re-uses these IDs for the remainder of the program.

Integrability,"ess, I guess that what @droazen is suggesting is quite important and I appreciate the interest for making better the downstream toolkits integration. Here, a real use case: I've just started to write a new toolkit that will use some walker classes from GATK (by now, `LocusWalker` or the `ReadSliderWalker` from #4682). With the current way of configuring the output, I will need to implement a layer for both walker classes (e.g., `MyLocusWalker` and `MyReadSliderWalker`) and use them in my implemented tools. In addition, I would like to bundle some tools from the GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of mana",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:1265,wrap,wrappers,1265,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['wrap'],['wrappers']

One could imagine that smoothing could be disabled (so that all samples retain the common segmentation after modeling) or made more aggressive (so that private events don't get inadvertently introduced into other samples due to noise, perhaps), depending on the use case. It looks like the joint segmentation allows some additional events to be resolved, although I haven't done any rigorous evaluations. We could probably cook up some evaluations using simulated toy data or in silico mixtures, but there's really no reason why this shouldn't work decently well, especially if the kernel-segmentation method works well on a single sample for your data. It would also be interesting to understand at which point changing segmentation parameters on a single sample can no longer yield the same performance as joint segmentation on a fixed number of samples; however, this is probably a function of various S/N ratios, and it might not be easy to characterize this behavior outside of toy data. The segmentation parameter space is big enough to make this unwieldy even for toy data, too. Perhaps we can get some feedback from test users---not only on performance, but also on the structure of the new workflow. It might also be worth gauging whether a new WDL is warranted. Otherwise, we just need to add some unit tests for correctness of the multisample-segmentation backend class, integration tests for plumbing of the new tool, and perhaps address some of the issues mentioned above.

Integrability,"gic, I prefer not to do it this way, because we can add more logics in the future, and capturing/resolving these BND's that are not suitable for _THIS PARTICULAR_ logic. I guess in general my personal preference is to put less algorithm-related information in VCF for analysts (less reading for them), and produce add on files for tool developers. What's your thoughts?. > Does this even have to be a spark tool? It looks like you are just reading the variants into a parallel spark context, filtering, and then collecting them to actually process them. Why not just make this a non-spark tool and process it all in memory on one node?. Answer: Agree. It doesn't have to be, at least in theory, and it probably is going to be faster as we don't need to incur the Spark overhead for such a typically small job. But (I'm saying too many buts....) up to this point all SV tools are under the package `hellbender.tools.spark.sv`, so I'm following suit here. Note the two classes's main interface methods mentions nothing about RDDs (that's on purpose). ; On the other hand, this is an engineering question I believe, and it depends on whether we want to put as much of discovery code as possible into `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` (the last commit actually hooks the two classes into it, so a single invocation of the tool produces more variants), or we go wdl in pipelining the whole process. -------. All in all, I think the comments and critics are generally about the ""filtering""/""classifying"" part, and the most serious concern about it is false negatives. Am I understanding correctly? If so, given that the filtering step is only picking the BND's that are suitable to the linking logic, I can imagine the false negative problem be solved in the future by other logics (e.g. more relaxed requirement on pair matching, or not even requiring matching INV55/INV33 pairs, etc.) In fact, that's what I'm planning on.; Another part of the problem is how much I can accomplish in this single",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929:6140,interface,interface,6140,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929,1,['interface'],['interface']

For `CollectAllelicCounts`, this simply uses code borrowed from `GetSampleName`. We should unify the reading and storing of sample names at some point (#2910).; - [x] We will need to replace `SimpleReadCountCollection` (which currently serves as the interface between the old coverage collection files and the new code) with one of these subclasses when `CollectReadCounts` is in. We can also change `NamedSampleFile` depending on what he's implemented.; - [x] We should eventually write proper SAM headers with useful tags to all TSV and HDF5 files generated by our tools that represent annotated intervals that can be associated with a single sample.

Integrability,"he code is in `CommandLineProgram`:. ```java; /**; *; * @return true if command line is valid; */; protected boolean parseArgs(final String[] argv) {. commandLineParser = new CommandLineArgumentParser(this, getPluginDescriptors());; try{; final boolean ret = commandLineParser.parseArguments(System.err, argv);; commandLine = commandLineParser.getCommandLine();; if (!ret) {; return false;; }; final String[] customErrorMessages = customCommandLineValidation();; if (customErrorMessages != null) {; for (final String msg : customErrorMessages) {; System.err.println(msg);; }; commandLineParser.usage(System.err, false);; return false;; }; return true;; } catch (final CommandLineException e){; //The CommandLineException is treated specially - we display help and no blow up; commandLineParser.usage(System.err, true);; printDecoratedUserExceptionMessage(System.err, e);; //rethrow e - this will be caught upstream and the right exit code will be used.; //we don't exit here though - only Main.main is allowed to call System.exit.; throw e;; }; }; ```. I think that GATK should discourage the usage of `CommandLineException` outside the Barclay engine or `customCommandLineValidation()`, and no wrapping the exception to `UserException` because it is related with the parsing. For instance, `MissingArgument` could be considere also an user exception, and almost all `CommandLineException` except the internal ones. I had the same problem when `CommandLineException` was part of `UserException` and I changed to use that one only to parts of the code related with arg parsing. That's why I included in the try-catch block the `customCommandLineValidation()` in #2226. I think that it makes more sense like this, because command line exceptions (e.g., bad or missing args) are printed with the usage of the tool, indicating why the argument is wrong and refering to the help; on the other hand, an user exception is more related with malformed files or other requirements not related with arg parsing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268660546:1373,wrap,wrapping,1373,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268660546,1,['wrap'],['wrapping']

Integrability,"implementation is different from the one in `ReadWindowWalker`: first, the overlap between windows is only in one direction; second, `SlidingWindowWalker` is more like a reference/interval walker, from the beginning of the reference (or interval) till the end, it walks in overlapping windows. One example is the following (window-size 10, window-step 5, the - represent the window):. ```; Reference: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows1: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows2: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows3: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows4: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows5: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; ```. Of course, after having a look to `ReadWindowWalker` I think that several things could be improved in my implementation for a general `SlidingWindowWalker`:; - Apply function similar to the `ReadWindowWalker`, with `ReadWindow` being empty if reads are not provided.; - Three window options: `windowSize` (the actual size of the window), `windowStep` (how much advance for the following window) and `windowPadding` (how much extend the window in both directions). Using this abstraction, `ReadWindowWalker` could be implemented setting `windowSize=windowStep`, and the problem that I need to solve could be implemented setting `windowPadding=0`. The simplest way to acomplish this is to use the current implementation of `ReadWindowWalker` to develop a `SlidingWindowWalker` adding three abstract methods for the three parameters (`getWindowSize()`, `getWindowStep()` and `getWindowPadding()`, and implement `ReadWindowWalker` as a extension of this interface setting `getWindowStep()` to return `getWindowSize()` and `requiresReads()` to true. I can do this once the PR #1567 is accepted and generate the two interfaces (to be sure that the integration with the HC engine is working as expected with the changes), or just implement the `SlidingWindowWalker` and you can include it in the HC PR, or update afterwards to avoid redundancy in the code. What do you think, @droazen?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1528#issuecomment-198438775:2154,interface,interface,2154,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1528#issuecomment-198438775,3,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integration', 'interface', 'interfaces']"

Integrability,"ions here, which might allow for easier treatment of ill-behaved annotations. However, I'd say enabling workflows where the set of annotations is fixed is the priority.; - [ ] We could do positive-unlabeled training more rigorously or iteratively. Right now, we essentially do a single iteration to determine negative data. This could perhaps be preceded by a round of refactoring to clean up model training and make it less procedural.; - [ ] Automatic threshold tuning could be built into the tool, see #7711. We'd probably have to introduce a ""validation"" label. Perhaps it makes sense to keep this sort of thing at the workflow level?; - [ ] In the positive-negative framework enforced by the Java code in this tool, a ""model"" is anything that assigns a score, we fit two models to different subsets of the data, and then take the difference of the two scores. While the python backend does give some freedom to specify a model, future developers may want to go beyond the framework itself. For example, more traditional classification frameworks, etc. could be explored. As an intermediate step, one could perhaps use the positive/negative scores from the current framework in a more sophisticated way (e.g., using them as features), rather than just taking their difference. This sort of future work could be developed completely independently of the codebase associated with the current training tool (or done externally in python), but should still be able to make use of the extract and score tools, since the contracts should be relatively general. EDIT: I think I will go ahead and ablate the positive-negative option, as this adds a lot of overly complicated code for little benefit. So Java code in this tool will only be responsible for selecting variant types---and we may even want to move that functionality into backends in the future. To start, BGMM and IsolationForest backends will be positive-only, and custom Python backends will have the unlabeled annotations passed directly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948369:2561,contract,contracts,2561,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948369,1,['contract'],['contracts']
Integrability,"ire count file for all samples a determining factor? If we can drastically reduce this cost, then we can dedicate more to increasing resolution, etc. Here is a minimal set of fixes that could enable the querying of intervals for GermlineCNVCaller (and also for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy without too much extra work, since we also subset intervals there) *only in the gCNV WGS pipeline*, without disrupting other interfaces:. 1) Write a Tribble SimpleCountCodec for the `counts.tsv` extension. I've already done this in a branch.; 2) Change GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy tools to accept paths.; 3) If an index is present for each count path, create a FeatureDataSource, merge the requested -L/-XL intervals, and query to perform the subset. We will also need to stream the SAM header metadata. It should not require much code to extract all this to a temporary IndexedSimpleCountCollection class. (Caveat: for now, this will work with the current gCNV convention of providing bins via -L/-XL. Technically, it will also work with the more conventional use of -L/-XL to denote contiguous regions, but we may have to perform checks that bins are not duplicated in adjacent shards if they overlap both, since querying a FeatureDataSource will return any bins that overlap the interval---rather than only those that are completely contained within it.); 4) Index read-count TSVs in the gCNV WGS pipeline after collection and modify the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and GermlineCNVCaller tasks to take read-count paths and indices, if necessary. These changes could be confined in the gCNV WGS WDL for now. I think that should do the trick. If this is high priority, I can implement now. In the future, we might be able to promote all Locatable CNV Records to Features and write code to automatically pass the columns/encoders/decoders (currently held in the Collection corresponding to each Record) to a single Tribble codec. This codec should not depend upon the file extension.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082:2121,depend,depend,2121,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"is is truly a code error, then the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. @lbergelson Can you confirm? . > Also, why @LeeTL1220 have you changed the title of this issue ticket? Can you please explain? Again, I reiterate that CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics works just fine. It is FilterByOrientationBias that errors without these workarounds. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (GATK version) definitely does not work just fine. I've cited the issue above. I do not think that any of the code fixes would actually go into FilterByOrientationBias. If the GATK version worked just fine, we would ditch the ``sed`` command and use that. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (Picard version) works just fine BUT it introduces that string which requires the ``sed`` statement. If you do not use ``sed``, a (general-use/engine) dependency of ``FilterByOrientationBias`` will try to instantiate a class that does not exist. The ``sed`` was supposed to be temporary until picard was wrapped properly in GATK. But until then, it does mean that all GATK-based downstream dependencies of ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` will fail without the sed. Again, the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. > Also, FilterByOrientationBias does not output bgzipped VCFs. So this is not in line with how GATK tools should work. . ``FilterByOrientationBias`` just farms it out to a VCF Writer. That dependency (VCF Writer) should handle that. Can you confirm, @lbergelson ? Is there an additional step to make this work that I did not know about?. > Again, FilterByOrientationBias is not production worthy and I think at this point it should get an experimental or BETA label. Only because of the ``sed`` nonsense, as near as I can tell. Definitely, BETA -- not experimental. All I'm saying is that I don't believe any code change needs to go into ``FilterByOrientationBias`` (with the possible exception of the bgzip VCF).

Integrability,"ke a Microsoft bug than a GATK one though. It seems crazy that each layer pull has to be a separate web request and there's no batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things. We've considered a java only image for a while which would be much smaller than the current one. (although still fat by most docker standards...). We've never released one publicly because it seemed like it might cause confusion, but it's a rea",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427:1123,depend,dependencies,1123,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Each scatter of ModelSegments will run as before, aside from skipping the segmentation step in favor of using the joint segmentation. We will repeat the het-genotyping step, but this is cheap and it's probably better to repeat it to make sure filtering is applied consistently. It would also require more changes to the command line to specify where to output the hets for each sample during multisample segmentation and to skip genotyping in each scatter, if we were to go that route. There are many possible combinations of inputs that need to be tested, but the same is already true of the current ModelSegments. Furthermore, there are slight wrinkles when running in tumor-only mode (i.e., when `--normal-allelic-counts` are not available). Because each sample is genotyped indiviudally, each may yield a different set of hets (in contrast to genotyping in matched-normal mode, in which the normal determines the set of hets used in all samples). We will thus have to take the intersection of these hets before performing multisample segmentation. Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-perform this intersection in each scatter, since we will no longer have access to the hets from the other samples. However, we *will* ultimately intersect the hets from each sample with the joint segmentation before modeling, which may be a rough proxy for the intersection of hets from a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549:2490,rout,route,2490,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549,1,['rout'],['route']

Integrability,"nds for identifying the copy-neutral state.; - [ ] @MartonKN is going to work on an improved caller for his next project. This caller should also make simple calls (not full allelic copy number, but just `0`, `+`, `-`), but should also take advantage of the copy-ratio and minor-allele fraction posteriors estimated by `ModelSegments` to generate quality scores. Plotting:; - Other than the allele-fraction model, the limiting factor was the original plotting code (some plotting runs originally took several hours for a single WGS sample...) We can now make plotting much faster with the ordering enforced by `TSVLocatableCollection` (see below).; - There are now two plotting tools, `PlotDenoisedCopyRatios` and `PlotModeledSegments`. This is in contrast to the old `PlotSegmentedCopyRatio` and `PlotACNVResults`.; - Because `ModelSegments` optionally takes denoised copy ratio and/or allelic counts, `PlotModeledSegments` outputs only the corresponding plots appropriately.; - I added a dependency on the R package `data.table` to slightly speed up the reading of input files.; - Setting `pch="".""` also sped up the generation of scatter plots.; - Plotting now takes a couple of minutes, most of which is I/O (#3554).; - AAF (rather than MAF) is now plotted for allele fraction (#2957). Other:; - I've introduced a `LocatableCollection` class to unify how allelic counts, copy ratios, and segments are stored and read/written from/to TSV (#2836). Intervals are always output in lexicographical order for now, to be consistent with the old coverage collection (#2951). Once @asmirnov239's `CollectReadCounts` is in, we can change everything over to ordering determined by the sequence dictionary.; - Column headers and log2 copy ratio output have been standardized throughout (#2886).; - [x] I've also introduced a `NamedSampleFile` abstract class to tag files that have `#SAMPLE_NAME=...` as the first comment line. For `CollectAllelicCounts`, this simply uses code borrowed from `GetSampleName`.

Integrability,"ntReads cannot subset based on a list of read names. Rather FilterSamReads can do so as long as the reads are queryname-sorted.

So instead, how about:; Identify sequence contexts that occur at high frequency in a reference; 2. Please define a kmer. If only a reference fasta is required (as listed under Inputs) great. But if the tool also depends on a FAI index and DICT dictionary, please do include them. Also, it would be good to provide an example of how such information is used in SV discovery, e.g. ""the resulting file can be given to FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark, which will then ignore such sequence contexts during analysis."" Also would be good to mention that the default kmer size (--k-size 51) is optimized for human if indeed this is the case.; 3. ReferenceProgramGroup.java. And `6. ` from above. ---; ## FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark. 1. Assembles and aligns contigs of genomic breakpoint regions associated with structural variants ; 2. Overview and Notes could use finessing but let's leave this for next year. One thing to include is a reference to FermiLite for those seeking more information. A publication would be best.

I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor. Not sure if this actually broke things though---need to check. (However, I don't actually think this is a very important use case to support...); - [x] Delete/deprecate/etc. CNN tools/tests as appropriate. Note that this has to be done concurrently, since we remove Tensorflow. @droazen perhaps I can take a first stab at this in a subsequent commit to this PR once more of the gCNV dust settles and/or has undergone a preliminary review? EDIT: Disabled integration/WDL tests. We should add some deprecation messages to the tools---we can note that they should still work in previous environments but will be untested.

Integrability,"ollapsed it into a single class for several reasons:; - Inheriting from a more generic traversal type caused usability issues and confusion with respect to the command-line arguments. The `ReadWindow` was the unit of processing for the superclass, but for `AssemblyRegionWalker` it was the unit of I/O and `AssemblyRegion` was the unit of processing, and I couldn't update the docs for `ReadWindowWalker` to clear up the confusion without mentioning `AssemblyRegion`-specific concepts.; - The `ReadShard` / `ReadWindow` was/is **only** there to prove that we can shard the data without introducing calling artifacts, and to provide a unit of parallelism for the upcoming Spark implementation. It's not something we really want to expose to users as a prominent knob, and we may hide it completely in the future once the shard size is tuned for performance.; - Inheriting from a more abstract walker type caused a number of other problems as well: methods that should have been final in the supertype could no longer be made final, with the result that tool implementations could inappropriately override engine initialization/shutdown routines. Also, there were issues with the progress meter, since both the supertype traversal and subtype traversal needed their own progress meter for their different units of processing. Ultimately it was just too awkward and forced, and the read shard is something that we eventually want to make an internal/encapsulated implementation detail anyway. GATK3 made the mistake, I think, of using long, confusing inheritance chains for its walker types, with the result that you got awkward and forced relationships like `RodWalker` inheriting from `LocusWalker`. It's better, I think, to make each traversal as standalone as possible, especially given the simplicity of writing a new walker type in GATK4. For all of these reasons we don't want `AssemblyRegionWalker` to inherit from a more abstract traversal type -- it's just going to be its own standalone thing",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513:1660,rout,routines,1660,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513,1,['rout'],['routines']

Integrability,"onsolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval. These optimizations were done using the Bayesian optimization framework I prototyped long ago (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer and https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t5WOAEOMp0xAzJgpKbP68BUnclNYfIVRrDSL9wl1-3A/edit?usp=sharing); this entailed running parameter scans using a local Cromwell on my desktop. Probably this optimization work could be redone relatively easily using the Neptune framework put together by @dalessioluca, which was still in development at the time I did this work. Happy to share the resources and scripts I used if we go down this route; they are pretty lightweight. See more discussion starting here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566. Alternatively, we could merge this branch to expose the parameters now and punt on consolidating/optimizing them. I'm not completely convinced we should even do the former unless we are going to follow through on the latter, but happy to defer to others. Finally, note also there is one code optimization that I removed, since it makes assumptions on the SW parameter values that might not be valid for non-default values. I'll highlight this with a comment below. We can restore it if we add code to check whether the assumptions hold, but I'd be curious to see in which cases the optimization makes a big difference.

Integrability,"ools `CallVariantsFromAlignedContigsSpark` and `CallVariantsFromAlignedContigsSAMSpark` share a significant part of workflow. Conceptually, what happens is:; 1. turn `AlignmentRegion`'s (produced by another tool in difference formats that must be parsed) into `AssembledBreakpoint`'s;; 2. extract `BreakpointAllele` from a `AssembledBreakpoint`, and group the `AssembledBreakpoint`'s by each of their `BreakpointAllele`;; 3. filter `BreakpointAllele`'s;; 4. for each `BreakpointAllele` that survived the filter, filter its supporting `AssembledBreakpoint`'s then create an `VariantContext`;; 5. write VCF. In both of the tools, these steps are accomplished in almost the same way, involving the following functions. ``` java; public static Iterable<AssembledBreakpoint> assembledBreakpointsFromAlignmentRegions(final byte[] contigSequence,; final Iterable<AlignmentRegion> alignmentRegionsIterable,; final Integer minAlignLength);. public static Tuple2<BreakpointAllele, Tuple2<Tuple2<String,String>, AssembledBreakpoint>> keyByBreakpointAllele(final Tuple2<Tuple2<String,String>, AssembledBreakpoint> breakpointIdAndAssembledBreakpoint);. public static Boolean inversionBreakpointFilter(final Tuple2<BreakpointAllele, Tuple2<Tuple2<String,String>,AssembledBreakpoint>> breakpointAlleleTuple2Tuple2);. public static VariantContext filterBreakpointsAndProduceVariants(final Tuple2<BreakpointAllele, Iterable<Tuple2<Tuple2<String,String>, AssembledBreakpoint>>> assembledBreakpointsPerAllele,; final Broadcast<ReferenceMultiSource> broadcastReference);; ```. The concept is general enough that a separate class (potentially having its own shallow class hierarchy for different types of SV's) is extracted and provide a single interface like `callVariants()`.; And if the afore-mentioned functions could be moved from `ContigAligner` to here, all of them can be packed in the extracted class/interface.; Then different callers for different SV types could just override (or whatever technique) when fit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2079#issuecomment-240138574:1761,interface,interface,1761,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2079#issuecomment-240138574,2,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"orcement of consistent GC-bias correction).; - [ ] That said, I'll carry over this TODO from above: Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - The only major difference is we no longer make a QC PoN or check for large events. This was performed awkwardly in the old pipeline, so I'd rather not port it over. Eventually we will do all denoising with the gCNV coverage model anyway.; - Pre/tangent-normalization copy ratio are now referred to as standardized/denoised copy ratio.; - [x] Old code is still used for GC-bias correction in `CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`, and we still use the `AnnotateTargets` tool. We should port this over (possibly as part of `PreprocessIntervals`) at some point (actually, I think we will be forced to, since `PreprocessIntervals` will output a Picard interval list, and `AnnotateTargets` outputs a target file).; - [x] Integration tests are still needed for `CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`. These might not test for correctness, but we could possibly compare to old PoNs. Segmentation/modeling:; - Instead of separate tools for copy-ratio segmentation (`PerformSegmentation`) and allele-fraction segmentation/union/modeling (`AllelicCNV`), there is now just a single segmentation/modeling tool (`ModelSegments`).; - Input is denoised copy ratio and/or allelic counts. If only one input is provided, then we only model only the corresponding quantity.; - There is no separate allele-fraction workflow. Unlike the old approach, we do not perform any genotyping or modeling before doing kernel segmentation.; - [x] Old code and classes are used for segment union. We should port or possibly replace this with a simple method that uses kernel segmentation. EDIT: Actually, just tried running a WGS sample and this is still a major bottleneck.

Integrability,"ot sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that. About the target-creator, known indels are really easy to port because the code is within the tool and is simpler - the only problem might be code coverage if there is no data for known indels. I will propose very soon two PRs with fully functional tools (without the n-way out feature for indel-realignment), and trying to add simple integration tests with the data already available on the repository and running with GATK3.8-1.

Integrability,"ould like to address are similar to yours, with some inclussions. * Regarding NIO support, I would go to remove completely `File` support. If API users need to use the `File` abstraction, they should convert to a `java.nio.Path` using the `toPath` method.; * In addition, I would like that HTTP/S and FTP is handled also with NIO. For HTTP/S, I am working in a simple `FileSystemProvider` that should be good enough for using in combination with HTSJDK ([jsr203-http](https://github.com/magicDGS/jsr203-http)), and I can speed up the development there for needs in HTSJDK; for FTP, maybe [ftp-fs](https://github.com/robtimus/ftp-fs) can be used or a simple implementation can be derived from the HTTP/S implementation (without credentials). This will remove the special handling of HTTP/S and FTP paths in HTSJDK in favor of a consistent and pluggable manner.; * Interfaces for the data types are great, and maybe it will be good to have codec interfaces for both encoding and decoding. For example, I am missing encoders in tribble (an attempt in https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/822 for writing support).; * For VCF, I would like to have a less diploid-centric interface and design, or at least a way of configure the catching of genotype-related attributes. Currently there are methods for homozygotes/heterozygotes that aren't really useful for triploids or even VCFs without variation (for example, in Pool-Seq data).; * Modular design for artifacts: thus, a project with only SAM/BAM requirements will require only `htsjdk-sam`, and if they also want CRAM support, `htsjdk-cram`. See https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/issues/896 for more info about it.; * Common license for all HTSJDK, or at least for each module. This will be good for taking into account legal concerns when including the library, because now there is a mixture depending on the files that are used. This is what is coming to my mind now.

Integrability,"periment with the LL score discussed there (see https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-060.pdf for the original paper---although note that despite the paper's high citation count, I'm not sure what the canonical name for this metric actually is, but it doesn't appear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use. For example, in malaria, it looks like we may have to resort to using a callset that has been very conservatively filtered as truth, which will bias us towards high scores and the peaks of the positive distribution. Perhaps we can also experiment with just treating training/truth on an equal footing (I think the distinction between the two is somewhat blurry in the original VQSR design, anyway). Perhaps @davidbenjamin has some thoughts? I see some related stuff going on in ThresholdCalculator, but I have to admit that I can't tell whether that's used in a ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241:1678,interface,interfaces,1678,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"ppear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use. For example, in malaria, it looks like we may have to resort to using a callset that has been very conservatively filtered as truth, which will bias us towards high scores and the peaks of the positive distribution. Perhaps we can also experiment with just treating training/truth on an equal footing (I think the distinction between the two is somewhat blurry in the original VQSR design, anyway). Perhaps @davidbenjamin has some thoughts? I see some related stuff going on in ThresholdCalculator, but I have to admit that I can't tell whether that's used in a similar PU context. Also note that depending on the model used, we might not have well calibrated posteriors---the IsolationForest simply outputs scores in a unit interval, and we simply report the difference between the positive and the negative scores, for example.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241:2557,depend,depending,2557,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"raction model only models hets, we perform a `GetHetCoverage`-like binomial genotyping step (and output the results) before modeling. However, instead of assuming the null hypothesis of het (f = 0.5) and accepting a site when we cannot reject the null, we assume the null hypothesis of hom (f = error rate or 1 - error rate) and accept a site when we can reject the null. This entire process is very similar to what @davidbenjamin does in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3638. We should consider combining this code (along with `AllelicCount`/`PileupSummary`) at some point.; - [x] Added option to use matched normal.; - [ ] Rather than port over the old modeling code, I would rather expand the allele-fraction model to allow for the modeling of hom sites. I wrote up such a model in some notes I sent around a few months back. This model allows for an allelic PoN that uses all sites to learn reference bias, not just hets. Depending on how our python development proceeds, I may try to implement this model using the old `GibbsSampler` code instead.; - [x] In the meantime, we can try to speed up the old allele-fraction model, which is now the main bottleneck. An easy (lazy) strategy might simply be to downsample and scale likelihoods when estimating global parameters. Addresses #2884.; - [x] Even though the simple copy-ratio model is much faster, it still takes ~15-20 minutes for 100 iterations on WGS, so we can downsample here too.; - [x] Integration tests are still needed; again, these might not test for correctness.; - I've added the ability to specify a prior for the minor-allele fraction, which alleviates the problem of residual bias in balanced segments.; - I've reduced the verbosity of the modeled-segments file. I only report posterior mode and 10%, 50%, and 90% deciles. Global parameters have the full deciles output in the .param files, but I removed the mode and highest density credible interval (because of the below item).; - [x] Some residual bias remains i",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828:5463,Depend,Depending,5463,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828,1,['Depend'],['Depending']

Integrability,"ree reads. For other; mutations, maybe there's less than 10 reads corresponding to less than 10; cells, and it can vary pretty dramatically. The total number of cells; represented in a single sample can be thousands to tens of thousands,; usually - but could be many more as the tech advances. My hack for it at the moment is to encode both the cell barcode and the UMI; information into the read name. Then, for each variant, I query the reads; that overlap that variant in the bam file and analyze each read for; supporting the variant or the REF allele - then I can count the reads; according to the specific cells and also deal with any UMI redundancy per; cell. This works pretty well except for the cases where the HC reassembly; provides evidence for the variant and I can't track it to the originally; aligned reads. Also, mostly I think the difficulty here relates to indels; around homopolymers with our pacbio long isoform reads in our rna-seq; variant pipeline that leverages the gatk rna-seq protocol with HC.

Integrability,"rk/bwa/BwaSpark.java#L47) launches `BwaSparkEngine` as follows:. ```; final BwaSparkEngine engine = new BwaSparkEngine(bwaArgs.numThreads, bwaArgs.fixedChunkSize, referenceFileName);; ```. and launches the alignment as follows:. ```; final JavaRDD<GATKRead> reads = engine.alignWithBWA(ctx, unalignedReads, readsHeader);; ```. That in turn calls the `align()` method within [BwaSparkEngine.java](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/9fb4d756afbbad58a7e709e2e9fd308983ad255b/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/spark/bwa/BwaSparkEngine.java#L72):. ```; final JavaRDD<String> samLines = align(shortReadPairs);; ```. which then instantiates a new [BwaMem](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/9fb4d756afbbad58a7e709e2e9fd308983ad255b/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/spark/bwa/BwaSparkEngine.java#L101) object:. ```; final BwaMem mem = new BwaMem(index);; ```. Since the BWA implementation at [lindenb/jbwa](https://github.com/lindenb/jbwa) is basically a direct call to Heng's BWA as a library, the BWA option for verbosity is set by the `-v` argument as noted [here](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#3):. ```; -v INT Control the verbose level of the output. This option has not been fully supported ; throughout BWA. Ideally, a value 0 for disabling all the output to stderr; 1 for ; outputting errors only; 2 for warnings and errors; 3 for all normal messages; 4 or ; higher for debugging. When this option takes value 4, the output is not SAM. [3] ; ```. This is used in Heng's [bwamem.c](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/5961611c358e480110793bbf241523a3cfac049b/bwamem.c#L1224-L1226) file - and several other places - which generates the printout you see, as follows:. ```; if (bwa_verbose >= 3); fprintf(stderr, ""[M::%s] Processed %d reads in %.3f CPU sec, %.3f real sec\n"", __func__, n, cputime() - ctime, realtime() - rtime);; }; ```. So I would just adjust the verbosity via the arguments to the level that is preferable. Hope it helps,; Paul",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2054#issuecomment-235675398:1628,message,messages,1628,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2054#issuecomment-235675398,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"s where results changed:. - For the snpeff test, since the behavior on this branch seems more correct to me than master, I tried running the GATK4 test case inputs with GATK3, and it produces exactly the same results as this branch does. So I think that issue was introduced by the original GATK4 port, and is fixed in this branch.; - The rest of the tests with changed results don't seem to hit your breakpoint, though. So I think we need to figure out why they changed, and maybe also compare them with GATK3 (which can be a pain because the output format is slightly different).; - As you mentioned, you changed the reference for testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields, which seems to have only affected the number of loci processed. So I'm unclear why that change was necessary. If the test truly should have been failing without this change, will it still fail if the change is reverted ? If not, can we fix it, and either way there should be a negative test for that case. A few other general comments:. - I changed this PR to `draft` mode for now, which just better categorizes it for our internal workflow purposes. When its ready for a detailed code review we can remove the `draft` status.; - The `HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>>` can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place.; - I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round.; - Any new classes/methods should use `final` for variables and parameters wherever applicable, and public classes and methods should have javadoc.; - Finally, I'm curious if you've tried any perf testing on this branch ? Is it better ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987:1380,wrap,wrapped,1380,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987,1,['wrap'],['wrapped']

Integrability,"serialization/spec/class.html#a4100):. _If not specified by the class, the value returned is a hash computed from the class's name, interfaces, methods, and fields using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) as defined by the National Institute of Standards._. Now when I look at the `java.io.ObjectStreamClass.java` file for 64-bit JDK7 and JDK8 - from src.zip - both have the same code for the following parts after performing a `diff` - I didn't list all of the lines of code since they are quite long:. ```; public long getSerialVersionUID() {; // REMIND: synchronize instead of relying on volatile?; if (suid == null) {; suid = AccessController.doPrivileged(; new PrivilegedAction<Long>() {; public Long run() {; return computeDefaultSUID(cl);; }; }; );; }; return suid.longValue();; }; ... private static long computeDefaultSUID(Class<?> cl) {; ...very long code which can be inspected via the src.zip file...; }; ```. So looking at the code portions of `computeDefaultSUID()` and I notice in our instance `ReadFilter` is a interface, which gets defined later via [ReadFilterLibrary.java](https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/blob/62ef76ba60951c562a0d4c39189aa3f01f27f8d3/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/filters/ReadFilterLibrary.java) or via `new ReadsFilter(readFilter, header)`, in either of these instances the fields would be different, based on this portion of `computeDefaultSUID` when looking at declared fields:. ```; Field[] fields = cl.getDeclaredFields();; MemberSignature[] fieldSigs = new MemberSignature[fields.length];; for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) {; fieldSigs[i] = new MemberSignature(fields[i]);; }; ```. Therefore the `SUID` would be different based on the fields it would have. Please let me know if I misinterpreted something. @jean-philippe-martin I would be happy to help out, but even when I try a small test like this I get an error - I probably am performing something incorrectly.

Integrability,"tarted to write a new toolkit that will use some walker classes from GATK (by now, `LocusWalker` or the `ReadSliderWalker` from #4682). With the current way of configuring the output, I will need to implement a layer for both walker classes (e.g., `MyLocusWalker` and `MyReadSliderWalker`) and use them in my implemented tools. In addition, I would like to bundle some tools from the GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of managing that woul be a new field in the CLP consisting on an interface/abstract class, `CommandLineStartupFormatter`, with the same CLP methods for this kind of operations, that will be p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:1511,wrap,wrapper,1511,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

We will not be able to build it on all the platforms (we made 1 snapshot on linux+mac to unblock ourselves but the real solution is for jbwa to be hosted on maven central and have pre-build binaries.

Integrability,"this for a first workflow to target?. 1) Run ExtractVariantAnnotations on a training set of chromosomes. You can keep training/truth labels as in Best Practices, for now.; 2) Run TrainVariantAnnotationsModel on that. We'll use the truth scores generated here for any sensitivity conversions---i.e., we'll be calibrating scores only to the truth sites that are contained in the training set of chromosomes.; 3) Use the trained model to run a single shard of ScoreVariantAnnotations on a validation set of chromosomes.; 4) Run some variation of the above script on the resulting outputs to determine SNP and INDEL score thresholds for optimizing the corresponding LL scores. We can also add some code to the script to use the truth scores from step 2 to convert these score thresholds into truth-sensitivity thresholds.; 5) Provide these truth-sensitivity thresholds to ScoreVariantAnnotations and use them to hard filter. Evaluate on a test set of chromosomes. If all looks good, we can later move steps 3-4 into the train tool and automate the passing of sensitivities in 5 via outputs in the model directory. This will let us keep the basic interface of ScoreVariantAnnotations the same, but we'll have to add a few basic parameters to TrainVariantAnnotationsModel to control the train/validation split. So I think all this branch is missing is step 5---we'll simply need to add command-line parameters for the SNP/INDEL sensitivity thresholds and then do the hard filtering in the VCF writing method highlighted above. Do you think you can handle implementing that in this branch, and then the rest at the WDL level? I can help with the python script for the LL stuff (or anything else), if needed. Not sure if you got a chance to check out what your collaborators are doing in the methods you're looking to compare against, but it would be good to understand if this basic scheme for train/validation/test splitting can be replicated over there.

Reply by @SHUANG-Broad (also copied to update the ""TODO"" message; > this predicate is currently used in two places (excluding appearance in comments): `BreakpointComplications.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointComplications`, where it is use to test if the input simple chimera indicates an inverse tandem duplication and trigger the logic for inferring duplicated region; and `BreakpointsInference.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointInference`, where it is used for breakpoint inference. The problem is, the contig will not even be sent here, because `AssemblyContigWithFineTunedAlignments.hasIncompletePictureFromTwoAlignments()` defines a simple chimera that has strand switch and the two alignments overlaps on reference as ""incomplete"", so in practice the two uses are not going to be triggered.

Integrability,"ur input file. If I am wrong and this is truly a code error, then the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. @lbergelson Can you confirm? . > Also, why @LeeTL1220 have you changed the title of this issue ticket? Can you please explain? Again, I reiterate that CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics works just fine. It is FilterByOrientationBias that errors without these workarounds. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (GATK version) definitely does not work just fine. I've cited the issue above. I do not think that any of the code fixes would actually go into FilterByOrientationBias. If the GATK version worked just fine, we would ditch the ``sed`` command and use that. ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` (Picard version) works just fine BUT it introduces that string which requires the ``sed`` statement. If you do not use ``sed``, a (general-use/engine) dependency of ``FilterByOrientationBias`` will try to instantiate a class that does not exist. The ``sed`` was supposed to be temporary until picard was wrapped properly in GATK. But until then, it does mean that all GATK-based downstream dependencies of ``CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics`` will fail without the sed. Again, the fix is not in ``FilterByOrientationBias``. > Also, FilterByOrientationBias does not output bgzipped VCFs. So this is not in line with how GATK tools should work. . ``FilterByOrientationBias`` just farms it out to a VCF Writer. That dependency (VCF Writer) should handle that. Can you confirm, @lbergelson ? Is there an additional step to make this work that I did not know about?. > Again, FilterByOrientationBias is not production worthy and I think at this point it should get an experimental or BETA label. Only because of the ``sed`` nonsense, as near as I can tell. Definitely, BETA -- not experimental.

Integrability,"very little GATK experience. The problem is that you've got AMD libraries on a PowerPC machine. I don't; know if GATK makes PowerPC libraries available natively, but you should be; able to get the source code and compile it yourself. Note that this will not fix the problem of your machine architecture; lacking the AVX instruction set. That's a hardware issue. But it should; (okay, *might*) get rid of the warnings about missing .so files. As an aside, I'm curious whether PowerPC architecture has an instruction; set similar to AVX. This is something I might actually be able to; contribute to the project so I'm excited by the prospect!. -Dan.

Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor.

Modifiability," really know what's happening. We wouldn't expect gatk4 haplotype caller to be that much slower. . It looks like they're running beta2 which is kind of old as well. Can you ask them what exact version they're using?. Can you ask if they have the log (stdout + stderr) for the gatk4 non-spark run? I can't tell what pairhmm they're actually running with and the logs would help with that. . Can you also find out what sort of hardware they're running on? Specifically, is it an intel machine with support for AVX?. A good setting for` --nativePairHmmThreads` is probably 4-8, you won't see any improvement after that. I also noticed that they're setting -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=32 for the gatk3. They would be better off setting it to 2-4 threads. Performance gets worse beyond that typically from what I've seen. They can set the same thing for gatk4 using`--javaOptions ' -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4'`. Their spark configuration looks wrong in a number of ways which is probably a big part of why they're not seeing any improvement. In general you want executors with ~4-8 cores and at least 4g of memory per core. I don't know how much memory their nodes have, and I don't know if they're running with autoscaling turned on, but I suspect they're only allocating 1 executor on 1 node and then it's thrashing memory because it's trying to run 32 threads at once. Spark tuning for haplotype caller is going to be complicated though and I don't know how to do it will yet, we will be revisiting it in the next quarter probably. They're also running withs spark 2.1.0, we currently require spark 2.0.2 which is an unfortunately specific version, we're planning on upgrading to spark 2.2.+ in the next quarter. . You should make it clear to them that the results will not be the same between 3, 4, and 4-spark yet and that 4 is in rapid state of flux and has known performance issues that we're planning on working soon.

Modifiability," should definitely provide defaults for typical data types in *documentation*.) And in the end, I think it is beneficial for users that wish to tweak knobs to do some work to understand what those knobs actually do (even if just at a basic level). The other downside of option 2 is that it might not be immediately obvious from the command line what parameters are being used. For example, if a user chooses a set of defaults but then overrides some of them, we should make it so they don't have to go digging through the logs to see what parameters are actually used in the end. Nor should they have to go back and check what the defaults were for whatever version of the jar they were using at the time. Option 2 might also make it easier to inadvertently override parameters, etc. via command-line typos or copy-and-paste errors---it's much more straightforward to require and check that every parameter is specified once and fallback to a default if not, as we do now. Not to say that we couldn't get around any of these issues in Barclay, but I think it'll require some thought and careful design. Would be interested to hear Engine team's opinions. Finally, one point that I think will become more relevant as our tools and pipelines become more flexible and parameterized: I think we should start thinking of ""Best Practices Recommendations"" less as ""here is the best set of parameters to use with your data"" and more as ""here is *how to find* the best set of parameters to use with your data (for a given truth set, sensitivity requirement, etc.)"". After all, if we are putting together pipelines to do hyperparameter optimization, there is no reason not to share them with the community. This would also relax the requirement that the defaults in the WDL (which have to be kept in sync with those in the GATK jar) represent some sort of Best Practices Recommendation, which is awkward in exactly scenarios like the one you highlight. @vdauwera @LeeTL1220 @sooheelee might have some thoughts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4719#issuecomment-385584289:1603,flexible,flexible,1603,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4719#issuecomment-385584289,2,"['flexible', 'parameteriz']","['flexible', 'parameterized']"

Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

Modifiability," unnecessary copies of the data (now fixed: https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow/pull/60), which caused OOM errors when trying to broadcast the 3GB reference data. With this fixed, I ran a [pipeline called JoinReferencesDataflow](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/dataflow/pipelines/JoinReferencesDataflow.java) on a small cluster that broadcasts the reference as a dataflow view. The code is a modified version of CountReadsDataflow that simply sends the view, and then doesn't use it, so we can see the cost of doing a broadcast (See the rest of the code in this branch: https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/tree/hadoop-references). JoinReferencesDataflow took 2 min 25s to run, of which 18s were for reading the reference from the local filesystem in the driver. For comparison, CountReadsDataflow took 17s on the same cluster. So broadcasting the reference takes less than 2 minutes. Note that this was just for one task, but Spark has [an efficient protocol for sending broadcast variables](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~agearh/cs267.sp10/files/mosharaf-spark-bc-report-spring10.pdf), which scales well with the number of nodes, so the approach looks feasible. Having said all that, we might still want to use the sharding approach, in order to share more code between the Google and Spark dataflow implementations. One way this could work would be to generalize `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata` to support reading reference data from a [ReferenceHadoopSource](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/dataflow/datasources/ReferenceHadoopSource.java), which is in line with @droazen's last comment.

However, the truth is that, in our cluster, when I submit the 25 jobs (for each chromosomes), they are assigned to different computer nodes randomly. It means that I have to set THEANO environment variable for each corresponding random computer nodes respectively, which is quite difficult for me, as the nodes are random assigned. So, now I'm going to add lines like below to the ~/.theanorc in my login node, to see what will happen. Maybe It will work.; #######; [global]; config.compile.timeout = 100000 ; ######.

Modifiability," what intervals were used for the jobs. I tried using running GenomicsDBImport with -L over a small region, or I ran SelectVariants on the gVCF first (which behaves a little differently), and then used that subset gVCF as input to GenomicsDBImport, where GenomicsDBImport is given the entire contig as the interval. The resulting workspaces will be slightly different, with the latter containing information over a wider region (GenomicsDBIport truncates start/end of the input records to just the target interval). . So if either of these workspaces is passed to GenotypeGVCFs, using --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals and -L 1:1050-1150:. I think any upstream padding doesnt matter. If you have a multi-nucleotide polymorphism that starts upstream of 1050 but spans 1050, this job wouldnt be responsible for calling that. The prior job, which has an interval set upstream of this one should call it. I think GenomicsDbImport's behavior is fine here. If you have a multi-NT variant that starts within 1050-1150, but extends outside (i.e. deletion or insertion starting at 1148), this could be a problem. The GenomicsDB workspace created with the interval 1:1050-1150 lacks the information to score that, right? The workspace created using the more permissive SelectVariants->GenomicsDBImport contains that downstream information and presumably would make the same call as if GenotypeGVCFs was given the intact chromosome as input, right?. However, it seems that if I simply create the workspace with a reasonably padded interval (adding 1kb should be more than enough for Illumina, right?), and then run GenotypeGVCFs with the original, unpassed interval, then the resulting workspace should contain all available information and GenotypeGVCFs should be able to make the same call as if it was given a whole-chromosome workspace as input. . Does that logic seem right? . ```; # The Input gVCF; 1	1040	.	A	<NON_REF>	.	.	END=1046	GT:DP:GQ:MIN_DP:PL	0/0:15:24:14:0,24,360; 1	1047	.	T	<NON_REF>	.

Here is the result of optimizing for sensitivity in the high-confidence, low-compexity region of chr22 in CHM, allowing haplotype-to-reference and read-to-haplotype (match, mismatch, gap open) to range over ([1, 20], [-20, -1], [-20, -1]) and fixing gap extend penalties to -1. The optimal (match, mismatch, gap open) parameters found in this run appear to be:. haplotype-to-reference: 2, -8, -19; read-to-haplotype: 1, -4, -3. I wouldn't put much stock in interpreting these parameters or their exact values for now, but it does appear that the match values and the haplotype-to-reference gap-open penalty might be saturating the bounds of the search. Plots of the type suggested by @dalessioluca might be more illuminating. Compare with default performance:. ````; Threshold True-pos-baseline True-pos-call False-pos False-neg Precision Sensitivity F-measure; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; 9.000 4003 4019 494 1036 0.8905 0.7944 0.8397; None 4009 4025 511 1030 0.8873 0.7956 0.8390; ````. That the corresponding curve with a precision/sensitivity endpoint of (0.8873, 0.7956) above isn't at the top of the pack means that we could squeeze out some extra calls by varying the SW parameters. Of course, this doesn't account for negative impact elsewhere. One could imagine writing a loss where this sensitivity is optimized while putting minimum constraints on precision, sensitivity, and/or F1 in the high-confidence, high-complexity regions (the assumption being the truth set is complete in those regions), or some weightings/variations thereof.

Modifiability,"**The following work has been done:**; - We performed a round of evaluations against XHMM and cn.MOPS on a cohort of 160 samples from SFARI project (which is described in our ASHG poster). For ground truth we used a callset generated from Talkowski lab SV pipeline on matched whole genome samples. Unfortunately, SFARI cohort is not public and cannot be used for public facing evaluations.; - Some hyperparameter tweaking was necessary to achieve good performance. Hyperparameters changed were contained mostly only to `psi_t` parameter.; - We developed a clustering procedure that is based on coverage profile at the set of targets that are highly variable across different capture kits. ; - We found that filtering on a QS metric on a final callset significantly boosted the specificity while lowering sensitivity insignificantly.; - We developed a hyperparameter optimization framework prototype that could be used in a future for general optimizations of cost/performance parameters for all GATK pipelines.; - We resolved several memory issues that came up during validations. **A few issues were encountered along the way:**; - The sensitivity and specificity on multiallellic (common) sites was significantly lower than on rare events.; - Single target calling sensitivity was lower than 20%.; - Pipeline WDL required optimization in order to handle whole genome data, however these changes were not consolidated in the official WDL. **Currently the ongoing work is focused on the following:**; - Improving sensitivity/specificity of calls on common regions. One solution being tested involves setting a prior for common regions derived from a high quality callset. Second solution is to set a different filtering threshold for common regions.; - Consolidating validation scripts to process gCNV output and outputs of competing tools measure their performances against ground truth.; - Analyzing 1000 Genomes exomes, which could be potentially used for public facing automatic evaluations. **The",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-532500502:649,variab,variable,649,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-532500502,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"1) Runtime Block. Generally diskpace, memory, and docker image would be the main cloud runtime attributes to have for a task. Maybe give them default values, so that users can change them in the json if they would like. ; 2) Variable declaration placement. Not absolutely necessary but thought it might help reduce the number of lines in the wdl. Here is an example where the task declares a variable that is not in the call or workflow block: [here](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/seq-format-conversion/blob/0f4abf107950769ffd891770db18c9691e720314/cram-to-bam.wdl#L79). Here is a wdl doc about it [(link)](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037485511-Add-Variables) though its old. Hard to find a direct statement about it in the wdl 1.0 spec but this section hints at it [link](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#declared-inputs-defaults-and-overrides).; 3.

Modifiability,"1. line coverage is 89% for this class. Uncovered code is for a) read without bases, b) IO exception when writing the report, c) plotting code. So i'm not too worried about this.; 2. agreed in principle. To make this doable though we need a testing framework that would make it easy to manufacture reads en bulk. Right now we'd need to make them one by one - integration test has a nice property of being portable across picard/gatk and it's easy to plug in because it has an input with many reads.

Modifiability,:+1: Thanks for fixing this. Just the comment on the comment. Feel free to merge when that is updated. I do think this test class is still very confusing in general though. . I don't understand why it's testing on a random combinatorial set of inputs instead of choosing a few explicitly. Surely showing that a method throws on null input once is just as good as showing it 10 time. Refactoring the whole thing seems out of scope though.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/743#issuecomment-124566502:383,Refactor,Refactoring,383,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/743#issuecomment-124566502,1,['Refactor'],['Refactoring']

Your java instance is set with -Xmx45G which will cover most of this limit and leaves only a handful of memory space for the native GenomicsDB library.

Can you explain what was happening before, and how the new code addresses it?. Sure! This code (besides refactoring so that it was only in one place) aims to fix two issues:; 1. if query results in an error, it gets run three more times and then, because of `while len(retry_delay) > 0`, it doesn’t run again and the `raise err` line never gets executed, so no error is ever raised; 2. if the query fails for a reason that has no chance of being fixed by a retry (eg. 404), it will still run three more times. I probably missed some errors that should be ""retry-able"" (maybe `Aborted `? `BadGateway`? `Cancelled `?

Modifiability,"> Still interested in the reference sample increase results. I wrote a unit test for that. QUAL decreases slowly as ref samples increase (e.g. one million ref samples decrease QUAL by about log_10 10^6 = 6), which I believe is the correct behavior. Overwhelming evidence that a variant is rare _ought_ to make any genotyper more skeptical about it. Note that this will only lose variants with very weak evidence. As for the command line unification that @vruano suggested, I put in a few hours and it's trickier than expected. If we use `pnrm` then we have to add an instance of `AFCalculatorImplementation`, which would need a `Supplier<AlleleFrequencyCalculator>`. But unlike the old exact model `AFCalculator`s the new one knows the heterozygosity priors (needed for Dirichlet prior pseudocounts) and needs to get those in its constructor. But this would mean that `AFCalculatorImplementation` would have to know about the heterozygosity command line arguments which would would in turn demand that it be refactored as something other than an `Enum`.

I honestly don't see the value of doing a full squash, mainly because if we are hosting this in a premium ACR, the limit is 10,000 readOps per minute. So with 16 layers, you get around 625 pulls per minute. Also, this will be able to still take advantage of parallel pulls (default is 3, but at most 16 threads in this case, I believe) as opposed to one big layer which will not download in parallel.

Modifiability,">--af_of_alleles_not_in_resource: is this allele frequency used only in certain contexts, e.g. with matched normal analyses, or towards tumor sample variant alleles, etc.? I need to add to the doc details how this argument factors into calculations. This is the population AF assigned to a variant not found in the germline resource and is inversely proportional to the number of samples used to create that resource. For example, gnomAD contains about 16,000 wgs samples, or 32,000 homologs per locus. Thus the AF of an allele not found in gnomAD is probably 1/32,000 or less. This is useful because it lets us use absence from the germline resource as evidence that an allele is *not* a germline variant. >I need a sentence or two describing the new algorithmic improvement on the new Mutect2 integration over uncertainty. Since allele depths (ADs) are subject to statistical error -- i.e. the exact number of reads for an allele is a random variable -- alleles' allele fractions are not known. Previously, M2 estimated allele fractions ffrom the ADs and proceeded with the likelihoods calculation. Now M2 uses nifty math to account for the uncertainty in the allele fraction when calculating likelihoods. In statistical language (which *will* be familiar to a decent-sized minority of users) we marginalize over allele fractions instead of using a maximum likelihood estimate. >The WDLs do not include use of a contamination.table and so I did not include it in the commands. Is this something we want to nudge users to use, i.e. should I put in a sentence in the documentation section about the new tool CalculateContamination?. `CalculateContamination` is invoked inside the `Filter` task in mutect2.wdl.

Modifiability,"@Aqoolare Hello. There are a a few things going on here. The `unrecognized runtime attribute keys` warning is coming from cromwell. It's telling you that the cromwell **local** backend doesn't understand those keys, which is true. That means it's just ignoring them. I think the actual problem is different though. You're running the spark tool in spark local mode, which in this case isn't configured to use the correct amount of cores or memory. I think the intent of this wdl script was that it would be run in a container on a cluster and the container would restrict the cores and memory options. In any case, it's not configured correctly for what you need. I would skip running cromwell and just invoke gatk directly since this wdl only executes a single job. Since this is going to run spark in local mode you need to specify the number of cores using the `--spark-master` argument, and set the memory using the `--java-options ""-Xmx""` arguments. For example:. ```; gatk ReadsPipelineSpark ; --java-options ""-Xmx16G"" ; --spark-master 'local[8]'; --I yourbam.; ... etc; ```. The above command is specifying to use 8 (that's what the local[**8**] means) cores for spark and give it 16G of memory. Your job was accidentally using 200 cores so it doesn't surprise me that it would run into memory issues. Using spark with more than 16ish cores in a single process is going to bog down a lot. I think 8 is a good starting place to try. If you want to go wider you should really look into running a proper cluster (or using dataproc), but there's pretty heavy diminishing returns. Try 8 or 16 and tune the memory from there.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7796#issuecomment-1108913771:391,config,configured,391,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7796#issuecomment-1108913771,2,['config'],['configured']

Modifiability,@DarioS Thanks for reporting this. It seems like there is an object in the tool which accumulates a record for every variant in the -V input. Since you're using gnomad it's very large. This is a design issue and seems like it should be fixed to stream the output instead of accumulating it all in memory and then dumping it at the end. @davidbenjamin I aimed this at you since it seems like it's your tool.

As I have said this is a specific utility is for SVs where they might only want to look at long range read pairs not HaplotypeCaller. In that context I would say that the nuance about TLEN vs left aligned start position is a relatively small one. I agree with you that it would be useful to have some functionality for filtering out highly distant read pairs form our short variant calling as an option. I would have to think on whether its better to refactor this filter to be more general or to make a second filter that is the reverse of this one. . @RWilton can you make an issue ticket and describe what you would want out of such a filter for HaplotypeCaller? I would put some thought into the case where the TLEN field has not been populated since it often isn't (especially since the cases where TLEN might not get computed overlaps with discordant/distant mates which are part of the target for such a filter).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1104014142:531,refactor,refactor,531,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1104014142,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"@TedBrookings which formats are you using, in particular? If there is a format out there that nicely fits our needs, we should adopt it. In the CNV package, I've taken pains to unify how tabular data are represented in Java, depending on whether each record is Locatable or whether the collection of records can be associated with a sample name or sequence dictionary. This allows us to represent records that extend Locatable with *multidimensional numerical or non-numerical annotations* along with some metadata (sample name and sequence dictionary) with a minimum of boilerplate. There are also base methods for producing interval trees, etc. This pretty much satisfies all of the CNV team's needs (and is, in my opinion, a necessary improvement over the horrowshow of read/write utility methods for each file format that we had previously...). However, this unification effort was a quick push I made before release, so some polishing or redesigning may be warranted. We may also want to add more forms of metadata, etc. if other teams would require more features. Another downside is that this code lacks the indexing, NIO support, etc. that some of the other standardized/Tribble formats enjoy. For CNV data, this isn't a huge issue, but I think it would be nice to unify how we represent such data GATK-wide.

Then package that in a structured way into a jar, and write some java code which will detect the platform at runtime and extract the correct executable into a temporary location. Then we can publish that jar as a maven artifact. We have an example of how to do the extraction in the `VectorLoglessPairHMM` constructor.

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad - I am not concern about the methods, because they are perfectly configurable, and actually this issue is not that important for some of my projects (e.g., `ReadTools`), which does not use the base walker clases from GATK. Nevertheless, I guess that what @droazen is suggesting is quite important and I appreciate the interest for making better the downstream toolkits integration. Here, a real use case: I've just started to write a new toolkit that will use some walker classes from GATK (by now, `LocusWalker` or the `ReadSliderWalker` from #4682). With the current way of configuring the output, I will need to implement a layer for both walker classes (e.g., `MyLocusWalker` and `MyReadSliderWalker`) and use them in my implemented tools. In addition, I would like to bundle some tools from the GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:75,config,configurable,75,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,2,['config'],"['configurable', 'configuring']"

I am not entirely sure I understand the reticence on plugins; however, my goal is to get VariantEval ported by touching as little of it as possible. This is already sucking up a ton of time. I flipped VariantEvalUtils to gather a list of classes from the appropriate package instead of a full-on plugin.

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad : if getStratifierClasses() is the only sticking point, we can drop that. . Stepping back: as you probably know we have a tool, VariantQC, which basically sets up a number of instances of VariantEval and uses them to aggregate data as it iterates a VCF. this allows the tool to capture data aggregated/stratified at multiple levels with one pass through the VCF. . There are two related aims:. 1) my tool needs to know the allowable stratification classes. Instead of copy/paste the reflection code to find classes, this PR was exposing that getter as a public method. I'm not sure I understand why this is a sticking point, but we can remove this without that much problem for me. Like we discussed earlier, VariantEval should get refactored into a walker class and some kind of VariantEvalEngine class, and this refactor might be a time to address my concern here. This is not actively blocking us. I could also make this a protected getter on VariantEval if the public aspect is what you dont like. 2) The remaining changes serve a different purpose. Most VariantEvaluator classes are 'dumb' in that they are instantiated with no configuration and always aggregate the same fields. In our tool, we wanted to let the user specify a list of INFO fields to aggregate (i.e. we dont know the target until runtime). We wrote an InfoFieldAggregator class, which is instantiated with the name of an INFO field. This lets our code create multiple instances of that VariantEvaluator, potentially summarizing different fields. The remaining changes are designed to enable this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5998#issuecomment-502946807:742,refactor,refactored,742,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5998#issuecomment-502946807,3,"['config', 'refactor']","['configuration', 'refactor', 'refactored']"

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad OK, considerable progress here. I was able to adjust behavior such that only two tests have changed behavior from GATK4/master. I think this is now correct. One instance of changed behavior is the Snpeff/overlap one we discussed above. The second is the one where we now provide the full genome as REF, not the truncated genome. I think this difference is justified since the tool now requires a reference, and the prior version was arguably too lenient on validation of contigs. Anyway, this branch now also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round. As noted above, I'd like to propose this as iterative, with a second PR coming soon. I did this b/c it moved us toward not needing to pass around the walker. It minimizes the code that has access to the walker (as opposed to setting it after creating the instance of the Evaluator, etc. Yes, it exposes it for two methods, but those classes no longer hang on to it.

Therefore refactoring a VariantEvalEngine out of VariantEval has value on this front, even if tricky. 2) From what I could tell, the worst perf is the iteration pattern.

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad The path to the c++ compiler can be specifically provided to theano by setting `theano.config.cxx` in python scripts, or by creating a `.theanorc` in the home directory, or by setting the environmental variable `THEANO_FLAGS=cxx=<path_to_g++>,...`. If a working c++ compiler exists and provided to theano, it is fair to assume that the graph _will_ compile. If the c++ compiler is not explicitly specified, theano will try to discover it. It first tries to execute `g++ -v` in the present environment and if it succeeds, it resolves the absolute path to the executable. On darwin, it further searches for `clang++` and on Win32, it looks for a working mingw gcc setup. We could _enforce_ the presence of a c++ compiler at the beginning of all python scripts and throw an exception and an informative message instead of numpy/python fallback.

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad 👍 to adding an advanced command line option for it. . @magicDGS Our goal is to make it unnecessary for normal users to ever need to see a stacktrace. We're definitely not at the point yet where every UserException produces either a) the complete information necessary to debug, or even b) the correct information. We're trying to fix all those cases, but there's a lot of possible failure modes between cloud access, spark, filesystem plugins, etc, so it's going to be an issue for a while. . I don't think it will hurt the user experience to have an extra commandline argument for it. Printing the stacktrace when debug is on isn't a bad idea, but I think it's better to have finer grained control over it. . The other issue is that it's easier to explain to an unsophisticated user how to set an extra commmand line argument rather than trying to get them to set the environment variable which well be helpful for our support team when they're trying to debug someone's problem.

Modifiability,"@cmnbroad, that's not wholly unreasonable, but i'd like to push back on a number of these points. . 1) First - would GATK consider simply letting us take over VariantEval and maintain as a GATK4-based tool in another repo? My understanding from GATK4 issues is that plan was to never migrate VariantEval (i think in favor of other picard/gatk QC tools). There is a bit of a conflict between keeping a lean core engine and having all these tools built off it. I would think there's an argument for keeping your core engine and the many tools built off it separated (GATK3 seemed to include some dead tools, for example). I appreciate we're the ones pushing this migration, but I hope on the other side you can appreciate the bar is pretty significant on our time. . 2) What new plugins are you talking about? VariantStratification and VariantEvaluator are part of GATK3's VariantEval? Yeah, I wrote a base PluginDescriptor class patterned on how ReadFilters work. It probably should exist in a more core position in code. While there's some good ideas in the argument-parsing/plugin code of GATK/Barlcay, frankly seems like much of it isnt fully developed yet, which is why I kept this separated at the moment. . 3) Be aware, the GATK3 tests depend on ~30GB of files. I dont know the limits of git lfs, but I did not currently have plans to check those in. I assumed I would convert these to use GATK4 chr20/21 data for a final commit, but felt there was a lot of value in using unaltered GATK3 data to confirm parity (and it was during the migration).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407123968:777,plugin,plugins,777,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407123968,3,"['Plugin', 'plugin']","['PluginDescriptor', 'plugin', 'plugins']"

Modifiability,"@davidadamsphd Sure, here is a quick guide to the code:. -`BaseRecalibratorSpark` is the standalone BQSR tool, and calls into the `BaseRecalibratorSparkFn` (which is also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -`ApplyBQSRSpark` is the standalone ApplyBQSR tool, and calls into the `ApplyBQSRSparkFn` (also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -Integration tests for the above are in `BaseRecalibratorSparkIntegrationTest` and `ApplyBQSRSparkIntegrationTest`. -Almost all other changes in the branch are related to the BQSR engine refactoring, which I summarize below:; - We pulled out the guts of the walker `BaseRecalibrator` tool, combined it with all of the code from the former `RecalibrationEngine` class (now deleted) to make a new `BaseRecalibrationEngine` class under `utils/recalibration`.; - We stripped out all copies of the code in `BaseRecalibrationEngine` from the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of BQSR, and modified them to call into `BaseRecalibrationEngine`.; - We moved all auxiliary classes needed by the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` (eg., the covariates, etc.) into `utils/recalibration`.; - We refactored the argument collections. Now there is a single shared `RecalibrationArgumentCollection` that contains **only** the parameters for the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` itself, and this argument collection is exposed by all 3 versions of the tool. Input/output arguments have been removed from this argument collection and put into the individual implementations of BQSR, since they vary between the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of the tool. This eliminates awkward problems such as having both a `knownSites` argument AND a `BQSRKnownVariants` exposed at the same time, with only 1 of them usable for a given version of a tool. The dataflow-only `BaseRecalibrationArgumentCollection` has been deleted completely as no longer needed.; - We tweaked the names of some tool arguments to enforce consistency between the 3 versions of the tool as well as the rest of hellbender (eg.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073:524,refactor,refactoring,524,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

Modifiability,"@davidbenjamin I looked into this more. From what I can tell, when a site is polymorphic, GenotypeGVCFs is going to trim to found alleles. Under normal conditions, when a site is not polymorphic, it doesnt get output. When output is forced (--force-output-interverals or output-all-sites), then the VC is just output as-is. This PR initially fixed the bug in removeNonRefAlleles(). I think GenotypeGVCFs should also prune unused alleles. If the site is not polymorphic, by definition I think that means removing all ALTs? I just checked in a few tweaks:. 1) I switched from the original test gVCF data I added to use an existing gVCF from GATK. This has the advantage of containing actual callable sites, not adding new data, and contains existing multi-allelic sites. . 2) I added code to GenotypeGVCFs so unused alleles will be trimmed as part of removeNonRefAlleles. I could understand if you want to change the name of that method now. This is currently always true; however, I could see a rationale for making --retain-unused-alleles-from-force-output-sites as a command line argument (i'd argue to default to false).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6406#issuecomment-577859097:77,polymorphi,polymorphic,77,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6406#issuecomment-577859097,3,['polymorphi'],['polymorphic']

Modifiability,"@davidbenjamin I've significantly refactored the production code, see the last commit. Most of this refactoring was to done make the code for the accounting of different modes (SNP/INDEL/both x BGMM/python x non/allele-specific) more minimal and straightforward. I've also combined the score/apply steps using the TwoPassVariantWalker. There's still lots of documentation, cleanup, and hardening/validation to be done, but most of the key methods and design choices have been documented, so I think it could be worth a quick review at this stage. Again, no need to nitpick code-style details, etc. (unless you really want to!) In the meantime, I'm going to do some more testing/tieout to make sure the refactor didn't break anything. This covers ~1800 LOC, which is roughly 50% of the equivalent VQSR code. Even modulo the remaining work just mentioned, which may add a few hundred LOC, I think this is a decent improvement---additional functionality, stability, etc. notwithstanding!. There's stubs for adding the truth-sensitivity conversion you proposed---should be pretty straightforward.

Modifiability,"@droazen @sooheelee Anything involving adaptors is not my forte but here goes my best shot. The basic idea of `getAdaptorBoundary` is to find the end of the insert, that is, where the original fragment ends and the adaptor begins. Since the 5' ends of the paired reads define the bounds of a fragment, its approach is to look for the start of the forward strand mate if our read is on the reverse strand, or the end of a reverse strand mate if our read is on the forward strand. This protects us from the possibility of a read longer than its insert. So far, so good, I think. One possible source of error is that these boundaries are determined by the *alignment* starts of the paired reads. This might clip too much if a read has a soft-clipped end and it turns out that these soft-clipped bases were e.g. a real insertion. Then the soft-clipped bases would be considered part of the adaptor. However, this can't do the more harmful thing of failing to clip an adaptor as far as I can tell. So it looks to me like the only issue is the edge case of falsely soft-clipped bases in very short inserts, in which case we hard clip the soft clips and in theory could lose some sensitivity. .

Modifiability,"@droazen Thank you for the confirmation that HaplotypeCaller performs separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities, and that the code on line 729 of HaplotypeCallerEngine.java (method ```filterNonPassingReads()``` ) is indeed executing subsequent to the ```MappingQualityReadFilter```. May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality. And if you have a moment, could you please point me to the code that might be adversely affected by decreasing the low-end MAPQ threshold? I might have some ideas about that (or not!)...

Modifiability,"@droazen Yes, this is because the native PairHMM is using single precision floating point and Flush To Zero (FTZ), while the Java PairHMM is using double precision and not using FTZ.

Modifiability,"@droazen sure. This PR updates both `BucketUtils.getPathOnGcs` and `IOUtils.getPath` (the latter indirectly) to create a Google Cloud Storage filesystem with a default reopen set to 3. Anyone opening the given `Path` (or even a `Path` derived from it, e.g. via `subpath`) will have the retries enabled. `addPrefetcher` wraps an existing `Path`, so it inherits the underlying `Path`'s retry behavior. Classes within htsjdk that create a `Path` from a String, without using our utility code, would indeed not set retries and errors on those files would not get the benefit of our extra retry. The exception to that is the Spark code path with `NioBam`: this goes via `ReadsIterable`, which also sets the retries. My understanding is that the normal way to open BAMs for tools always creates the `Path` object when parsing the command line, as in e.g. `ReadInputArgumentCollection::GetReadIndexPaths()`. That code path that calls `IOUtils.getPath` (and thus sets the retries). I would expect that the added support for VCF follows the same style, though it looks like it doesn't.

Modifiability,"@droazen, if it's true we can merge the headers then I suppose that may be a possibility. I'm a little bit dubious, though, because one of the pieces of information is the reference index to reference name mapping, and I didn't think we required those to match. Or do we?. Keep in mind however that static variables aren't serialized, so we'd still have to include some fancy code to make sure that every worker has the header. And since workers may be added dynamically by Dataflow's auto-tuning, we may have to call that code at the beginning of every transform... just like addHeaders. . So we would have some ""action-at-a-distance"" type of code, with statics that may or may not have different values depending on which computer you're on. This sounds like it may be just as error-prone and headache-causing as the other approach. At this point I'm still leaning towards manually putting the headers back. I think this makes the code less surprising than using globals (statics are a form of global variable after all) and so less likely to confuse someone new to the codebase.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141155796:306,variab,variables,306,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141155796,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

Modifiability,"@jamesemery Back to you, at long last. I adopted your suggestion of a proper search that doesn't revisit already-seen vertices and came up with a better way of seeding the ""good"" subgraph that is safe from your STR concern. As far as code is concerned it's a total rewrite — you can pretend the first PR commit doesn't exist. The new criterion for seeding the search is chains with good log odds on both ends and which are incident on a vertex with multiple good out-edges or multiple good in-edges. The rationale is that the adjacency of two bad edges may have good log odds (Suppose a bad edge comes in and two bad edges come out. One is a new error on top of the original error and one is the continuation of the original error) but two have two outgoing edges with good log odds requires an actual real variant. On our M2 validations this essentially no effect on sensitivity and a mild reduction in false positives.

Modifiability,"@jamesemery and now the overview of the more complex changes:. - `AssemblyResultSet`: the code for adding and removing haplotypes based on pileup alleles has become a `void` method of this class, where it belongs. Here and elsewhere I introduce snappy variable and function named referring to ""good"" and ""bad"" alleles, which I find visually much clearer. The code is basically the same as before but somewhat streamified. I extracted a `makeHaplotypeWithInsertedEvent` method to eliminate some code duplication between GGA and pileup force-calling.; - `HaplotypeCallerEngine` and `Mutect2Engine`: Force-calling alleles are split into biallelic `Events`. Duplicated code for finding all pileup events, then sifting them into good event to force-call and bad events to remove is extracted as `PileupBasedAlleles.goodAndBadPileupEvents`. Computing `allVariationEvents` is much simpler because 1) it now uses `Event` instead of `VariantContext` and 2) `Event` overrides `equals` and `hashCode`.; - `PileupBasedAlleles`: `getPileupVariantContexts` and sorting into good and bad pileup variants has been unified into `goodAndBadPileupEvents()`. It has additionally been somewhat rewritten for conciseness. Also, instead of the somewhat kludgy method of making `VariantContext` with four temporary attributes, then filtering based on those attributes, it calculates the filtering status immediately and uses `Events`. Also fixed the somewhat-misleading use of the word `alt` to mean `SNP`.; - `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils`: `applyPileupEventsAsForcedAlleles`, along with several helper methods that it calls, has been moved into `AssemblyResultResult`, where it is now a void member method.; - `GATKVariantContextUtils` mainly just using `Event` instead of `VariantContext`, which simplifies the code for splitting a `VariantContext` into biallelics.

Modifiability,"@jamesemery sorry to bug on this topic, but I'm hoping to make a push early this year to fully migrate my lab off GATK3 . I looked more closely at the specific annotations we need to migrate. I decided that I will implement our walker, 'DiscvrVariantAnnotator', which is basically a light wrapper around VariantAnnotation. This will make it easier to spike in custom annotations. In that walker, I will override makeVariantAnnotations(). I will make a new marker interface for EngineAwareAnnotation, and test that on all the Annotation classes, and use this to inject FeatureManager. So no core GATK changes needed. I did find one thing I'd like to propose. You probably know PedigreeAnnotation is special-cased in GATK. Annotations that use it have automatic argument validation and have the SampleDB injected. Currently, PedigreeAnnotation is a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation, so isnt available to GenotypeAnnotations. There doesnt appear to be a solid reason why. I tried to fix that and my best idea is the proposal here: #7041 . The core idea is to convert InfoFieldAnnotation and GenotypeAnnotation to interfaces. This is generally a trivial switch in existing code. With that, it becomes possible for classes that currently extend PedigreeAnnotation (which I switched to no longer extend InfoFieldAnnotation) to simply PedigreeAnnotation and implement InfoFieldAnnotation. This makes it possible for future classes to extend PedigreeAnnotation and implement GenotypeAnnotation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6930#issuecomment-760424063:1232,extend,extend,1232,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6930#issuecomment-760424063,3,['extend'],['extend']
Modifiability,"@jamesemery the use of padding is a little confusing. One use of padding is for providing extra reference bases around the reads. This is the case in `ReadWalkerSpark`, for example. When the whole reference is available via the Spark files mechanism (which is what this PR is about) then there is no need for padding (and in the case of `ReadWalkerSpark`, no need for sharding at all). Therefore it makes sense to remove the use of padding in these cases. Another use of padding was for providing more reads around an area of interest in assembly region/haplotype caller tools. This is no longer the case though, since the refactoring that @droazen did in `HaplotypeCaller` in #4031. However, `HaplotypeCallerSpark` has not been updated to reflect the changes from that refactoring, so it's probably best not to change the padding in that class. I've reverted the change there for this reason. The locus walkers never had any need for padding, except for padding reference bases in `LocusWalkerSpark`, mentioned above. I've added a comment in the code to clarify this. Hopefully that makes more sense now.

The cases where it doesn't work are edge cases, but they exist. Second, @jean-philippe-martin found that converting to Google `Read` was fairly expensive. Between those two points, I think we're probably better off with SAM-backed reads. (Also, right now the Google `Read` is serialized via JSON, so it's not that small anyway.). @tomwhite and @jean-philippe-martin, I think adding the header back will be fine for us engineers working on the engine, but it will make for a poorer user experience for newcomers and Comp Bios to burden them with having to care about what happens with shuffles (when they just want to prototype something). . That said, I think this is probably the best approach we have at our disposal. If we do, we need to do an excellent job of throwing errors if users try to perform actions that would require the header. The error message should explain what really happened and ideally point to some documentation we write explaining the stripping of the header and how to fix it. If this error occurs, it needs to be simple for anyone to fix it. @droazen @lbergelson, what do you two think? (also @laserson, do you have any ideas or thoughts on the header since we're probably stuck with `SAMRecord`?)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141086025:159,refactor,refactored,159,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141086025,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

Modifiability,"@lbergelson Sorry to be unclear---this isn't a GATK issue. For Cromwell, you can configure various options for each backend. For example, if you are running on a local backend with Docker, you can set a `submit-docker` attribute to specify the string that runs the Docker container; so to solve the above problem, you'd set this to include `--shm-size` and set it accordingly. However, according to @jsotobroad, you're not allowed such an attribute when submitting to Google cloud. If that's the case, then this is more of an issue with the Cromwell/Google Pipelines interface than the data.table package (although, as the discussion in the GitHub issue above shows, it'd be a simple fix on the data.table end, so I'm not sure why it's not addressed yet...) Changing the R script to get around the issue in this particular case is not unacceptably ugly, but you could imagine we might run into a similar problem in the future if anything else exceeds the 64MB /dev/shm limit and also cannot specify tmpfs.
