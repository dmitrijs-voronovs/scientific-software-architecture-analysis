Testability,"Ok noted, thanks.

For 100M entries per thread into 10 branches, the only worse performance I can find is with 64 threads (on `ntpl-perf01`):; ```; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.00-master.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:08.58; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.01-limit.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:12.00; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.02-no-queue.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:16.36; ```.

Testability,"Ok, I found out what was wrong and fixed it, taking advantage of some suggestion I got in the upstream LLVM review. The issue was missing pointer stability due to the fact the resizing of the backend store could have incurred in copies later than previously expected. The new code uses a BumpPtrAllocator to allocate the pages of items, rather than resizing an std::vector, so it's guaranteed that the elements don't move once they have been allocated (at the cost of the allocated memory not being necessarity contiguous anymore).

They didn't have an effect in the past, and nobody complained other than not being able to override them.; - If we think that `-O2` is better than `-O3`, it's fine to do it [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f040e05154c9f4c9899cd6e2262c68a0af944ea5/CMakeLists.txt#L14) by setting one of the `*_INIT` variables.; - We seem to be able to use the same for linux as for Mac, so less configs, and for Windows we just don't do anything. CMake will figure it out.; - If you want asserts, there's two easy ways to get them:; 1. Configure with `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=""-O2 -g"" ...`; 2.

Testability,"Ok, I have now set up the test in the only way possible, I think. It walks through the received tasks array, placing them in front of the `expected_order` array, until it finds task 9.

Worst case received order would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Basically, two constraints are guaranteed: in the first part of the received array the task number increases monotonically and the second part (after 9) decreases monotonically.

Testability,"Ok, I've had a first quick look. This is rather a feature than a bug. During alignment, some bounding boxes and voxels need to be recomputed (see the logic in [TGeoPhysicalNode::Align](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/7c81a10d9fa965b25f35b0ec709d6095a209ac16/geom/geom/src/TGeoPhysicalNode.cxx#L293#L306)). Since a given volume may be changed by many physical node alignments, their bounding boxes and voxels are only marked to be recomputed, otherwise the operation takes too long for complex cases. This lazy recomputation occurs only when any navigation function is called for the given volume, but not when calling just the getter of the box dimensions. So the behavior runtime should be OK, even if you see that some bounding boxes appear to be zero just after alignment. The recomputation of boxes/voxels can be however triggered manually using the following code:; ```; TIter nextv(gGeoManager->GetListOfVolumes());; TGeoVolume *vol;; while ((vol = (TGeoVolume*)nextv())) {; if (vol->IsAssembly()) vol->GetShape()->ComputeBBox();; auto finder = vol->GetVoxels();; if (finder && finder->NeedRebuild()) {; finder->Voxelize();; vol->FindOverlaps();; }; }; ```; I guess this code could be automatically called inside TGeoManager::RefreshPhysicalNodes() which needs to be called anyway by the user to recover pointer consistency after all alignments are applied.

Testability,"Ok, we reached the first milestone: the upgrade builds on all platforms :tada: . The next step is to investigate the failures in ROOT's tests (but please don't look at the last test report from the new CI, it's incomplete because I messed up the paths when uploading the results; it was done properly in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13310). We have a couple of failures across all platforms, and the easiest to understand is that LLVM 16 prepends `class` or `struct` less often for C++ class types. Eventually this comes down to (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f8a3ca38000; root [2] struct A b; (struct A &) @0x7f8a33db2000; ```; whereas LLVM 16 now prints; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f025c5a6000; root [2] struct A b; (A &) @0x7f025c5a0000; ```. Similarly the following used to output (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] .Class A; ===========================================================================; struct A; SIZE: 1 FILE: ROOT_prompt_0 LINE: 1; List of member variables: -------------------------------------------------; List of member functions: -------------------------------------------------; filename line:size busy function type and name; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: struct A f();; ```; while with LLVM 16 we get; ```; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: A f();; ```; (funnily enough, `struct A { struct A f(); };` still outputs `public: struct A f();` for LLVM 16). This affects a couple of Cling tests and 3 ROOT tests: `roottest-cling-operator-runEqualTest`, `roottest-cling-template-separateDict-make`, and `roottest-cling-template-separateDictNamespace-make`. I propose we just update the expected reference output and be done with it.

Testability,"On the jenkins build node the error appears likely because of '-Dsoversion=""On""' and the following. One test that fails is 'runload.C' in roottest/root/treeformula/sync. There we have (essentially):; ```; {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L loadcode.C+"");; ...; TTree *t; _file0->GetObject(""t"",t);; }; ```; The use of TTree means that before executing the script libTree is laoded.; During the execution of CompileMacro, the depend library are loaded (see for example the collection line [3363](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f32d06e70ce357b53050a25eecd5186859021e30/core/base/src/TSystem.cxx#L3363) .; And in this case the result is:; ```; loadcode_C.so libTree.6.21.01.so libTree.so; ```; which coupled with the ***new*** feature that gSystem->Load first dlclose the library then reopen it means that libTree is dlclose 2 or 3 times (one for both the versioned and unversioned version). This behavior is a **very significant** departure from the existing behavior (where, because the libraries were added to the link line, the library were never reloaded). Reloading arbitrary depend library is never a good idea since they (are likely to) include static object that may do things that are **essential** to do only once (initialization, connection to db). Technically CompileMacro could (as it does elsewhere) first check if the library is loaded. But still several questions:. 1) Why is libTree listed twice in the list of depend library?. 2) When should gSystem->Load automatically reload a library, if ever?. @Axel-Naumann @vgvassilev opinions?. PS. Even-though the set of test would be fixed by updating gSystem->Load and/or CompileMacro, the PR is still likely necessary for the case where CompileMacro generates a pcm (and thus need to support reload) or the case where the user explicitly unload a library.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721:104,test,test,104,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Oops, the above wasn't enough for the ""revert"", I also had to replace the calling site (in `flexibleInterp`) with. ```; // return total * std::exp(interpolate6thDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are fi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:176,log,log,176,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,4,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Probably to summarize: Following cmake best practise, all `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS*` should be set **before** calling `project(ROOT)` because the `project` calls finalises these variables. Indeed, this could be ok if no build flag relies on finding a package and then changes its behaviour. **After** `project(ROOT)` we should change `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS*` just by doing string manipulation. @hageboeck Is this correct?.

Testability,"Regarding the titular issue, I have been thinking about it for a bit and I don't think we can do much better than what @pieterdavid already implemented. Solutions considered:. 1. Implicitly converting `TClonesArrays` to `RVecs` would be a) backward-incompatible and b) a silent perf degradation, as it requires a copy. Moreover, if we did this I don't see a migration path that doesn't require that users revise all their TClonesArrays-related logic; 2. Adding a `TClonesArrays2RVec` helper function: it would require a copy (or it would have to return a clunky `RVec<T*>`). It is also trivial to implement for users that need it and don't mind the downsides.; 3. Adding a RDF toggle to tweak ""read TClonesArrays as RVecs"" or not: requires adding a bunch of extra logic to the column-reading mechanism for a feature that might end up being mostly unused (modern data models don't use TClonesArrays), and it would require the extra copy (i.e. silent performance degradation). The best seems to be 3, but feature toggles complicate internals and are typically not easy to discover (might end up mostly unused). It seems simpler to ask users to explicitly do the conversion in a `Redefine` if they need/want to. Sorry I could not come up with something nice :confused: .

Testability,"Replying to two different comments:. ### 1. > they are automatically inline and should not need the definition out-of-line. My standardese is poor, but reading https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0386r2.pdf : ; Line starting with `n 9.2.3.2p3, change:`; > An inline static data member can be defined in the class definition and may specify; a brace or equal initializer. If the member is declared with the constexpr specifier, it may be; redeclared in namespace scope with no initializer (this usage is deprecated; see D.X). So it says that the usage is deprecated, but it *may* still be used. I couldn't find any specific document on whether the main compiler vendors actually implement this change, since it is not strictly enforced maybe it's just not there?. ### 2. > Would be interesting to know how inline const behaves... So with the patch; ```; diff --git a/core/base/inc/TString.h b/core/base/inc/TString.h; index 58b47530fd..b74fe29e5c 100644; --- a/core/base/inc/TString.h; +++ b/core/base/inc/TString.h; @@ -277,7 +277,7 @@ private:; public:; enum EStripType { kLeading = 0x1, kTrailing = 0x2, kBoth = 0x3 };; enum ECaseCompare { kExact, kIgnoreCase };; - static const Ssiz_t kNPOS = ::kNPOS;; + static inline const Ssiz_t kNPOS = ::kNPOS;; ; TString(); // Null string; explicit TString(Ssiz_t ic); // Suggested capacity; ```.

Testability,"Results of today's investigations: The reason is that `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` assigns internal linkage to `const` qualified variables without external storage class, which then our `KeepLocalGVPass` changes to a weak symbol. If that happens in multiple transactions, the JIT infrastructure (?) merges the symbols into one memory location but constructors and destructors run multiple times on the same object (see above). We cannot disable `KeepLocalGVPass` because it also takes care of `static` variables in functions that are lazily initialized. Additionally, not merging the constant variables would mean that they have different addresses which could also cause problems (FWIW this is what you get upstream in `clang-repl`). Fun fact: it works by accident in the upgrade to LLVM 16 because I backported https://reviews.llvm.org/D156537, but not https://reviews.llvm.org/D156897 so if a variable `MustBeEmitted` it is actually not re-emitted and `KeepLocalGVPass` works correctly. Conclusion: What I think we should really do here is patch `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` to not assign internal linkage to `const` qualified variables under `IncrementalExtensions`.

Testability,"Right, of course the tests are correctly failing now where they still use `Offset` for the `NewStyle` likelihoods :). We should probably do two things to finish this PR:; 1. Add a test somewhere (I guess `testLikelihoodGradientJob.cxx` is as good a place as any) that fails when creating a likelihood with the two arguments together. The test can simply check whether the output of `createNLL` is `0`.; 2. Remove `Offset` from the `NewStyle` likelihood creation lines. _Side note:_ I think it would be much better if [`createNLL` just throws here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooAbsPdf.cxx#L1032) instead of returning zero and causing segfaults along the way.

Testability,"Right, that's also what I was scratching my head. By putting an `assert(0)`, I found that `AlternateTuple` is called from a `rootcling` invocation, and the member that triggers the `tuple` is a `unique_ptr<filesystem::path::_List::_Impl,filesystem::path::_List::_Impl_deleter>`. ie the underlying cause is the same as https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13361",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13574#issuecomment-1757850643:65,assert,assert,65,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13574#issuecomment-1757850643,1,['assert'],['assert']

[DF] Avoid calling InitSlot/FinaliseSlot multiple times on RDefines. Before this commit, each action and filter was calling InitSlot on all; the defines it knew about. As a consequence, RDefine had to keep track; of whether InitSlot was already called on it for a given task and a; given slot. We can avoid the multiple InitSlot calls on the same objects and the; book-keeping of whether the call already happened or not by having; RLoopManager call InitSlot on every defined column once per task and per; slot. To this end, we need to register RDefine objects with the; RLoopManager when they are created and deregister them when they are; destroyed. tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RAction.hxx | 14 +++++++-------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RBookedDefines.hxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefine.hxx | 20 ++++++--------------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefineBase.hxx | 1 -; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RFilter.hxx | 14 ++++++--------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RInterface.hxx | 8 +++++---; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RJittedDefine.hxx | 1 +; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RLoopManager.hxx | 4 ++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDFBookedDefines.cxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDefineBase.cxx | 10 ++++------; tree/dataframe/src/RJittedDefine.cxx | 6 ++++++; tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx | 15 +++++++++++++++; 12 files changed, 64 insertions(+), 39 deletions(-); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565:16,test,testing,16,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565,2,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"So I finally managed to get back to this and try a few things and as a result in my tests I managed to go from 82 MB of overhead to 62 MB. See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13641 for the actual code. While there is still a few things to cleanup, I think what I have is fairly general and quite self contained change, so I would appreciate feedback and if people like it, instructions on how to proceed to make sure this ends up upstream. The solution is based on a newly introduced `PagedVector<T>` which allows registering callbacks which get invoked whenever the associated range is accessed the first time. At such point, the range is actually allocated and each element of the range is passed to the callback. Initially I developed a mechanism to be general enough to do complex initialisations of the elements, however I later realised this is not actually needed. In order to optimise the issue with the large vectors `TypesLoaded` and `DeclsLoaded` one only needs to have something which does the default construction of their elements for ranges which are small enough to avoid to large upfront allocations. The code which is currently there in root / clang is already smart enough to lazily initialise only the elements which are actually needed, so the whole issue is to find a good tradeoff between number of ranges and sparse enough ones. A few caveats:. - `PagedVector` is a bad name, I agree. Suggestions are welcome.; - At the moment the implementation allows generic callbacks for ranges, however as I said we only need default initialisation. Removing such flexibility should buy another 1 MB from my test.; - In case `DeclID*` and `QualType` can default to all 0, one could probably achieve the same result in a more elegant way using calloc / realloc.; - There are probably other vectors which can be optimised in the same way, in particular IdentifiersLoaded as already mentioned by @vgvassilev.

Testability,"Some random comments:. This might behave differently in the llvm13 branch. But until we really know how llvm13 deals with symbols (i.e. until all tests currently failing with missing symbols are fixed) I find it courageous to do a change like this one, unless we know **why** this facility is not needed anymore. Here the reason seemed mostly heuristic, iiuc?. I'd propose to shelves this, and get back to it once llvm13 is merged. IURC, this facility here is used in the case where a symbol gets emittedv and then unloaded. If the symbol was actually defined _before_ the unloaded transaction (because it was determined to be a deferred symbol) then we need to remember that we _could_ emit it again, we need to put it back into ""deferred, might want to emit later"" state.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10696#issuecomment-1145807240:146,test,tests,146,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10696#issuecomment-1145807240,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Sorry for the late reply!. I would like to understand why exactly the tests fail. We're dealing with summation errors like these all the time in RooFit. Imho, we need to understand as exactly as possible where they come from and then document that. If we cannot do that, then we should treat them as errors, until we understand the fundamental limits, e.g. from hardware summation implementations. I can well imagine that that is the root cause here, but I would like to see some hard confirmation of that. The reason I'm so insistent on this is that I've spent the past year trying to unravel subtle bugs involving multiple summations that may either fail because of implementation issues (like e.g. was the case for KahanSum) or because of fundamental limits in algorithms (Kahan summation also still has errors) or because of fundamental hardware limits or single vs double vs long double precision, etcetera.

Testability,"Sure, feel free to get back to me when you have a proposed fix and I'll see if it works :). I did a test locally on a clean 20.04 VM with the most minimal set of dependencies installed and the problem didn't occur there, so I'd guess it only appears with a particular configuration that I just happen to have being lucky with. If it helps, you can see the exact list of packages [here](https://github.com/MrCarroll/root-snap/blob/6925e2516007943701ce934eb5da03c7cac07fd4/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L30), which are installed on top of an LXC container of Ubuntu 20.04",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7406#issuecomment-793595045:100,test,test,100,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7406#issuecomment-793595045,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Synopsis of the original error report:. Description. I had thought that our `art v3_09_01` based art passed all of our validation tests but I missed a single histogram that failed. I discovered it yesterday. I traced it back to the following. We have a file. `/pnfs/mu2e/scratch/users/brownd/workflow/default/outstage/44170899/00/00000/dig.brownd.CeEndpointMix.MDC2020b.001201_00000000.art`. It was written by `art v3_06_03`. One of the data products is of type `std::vector<StepPointMC>`, where `StepPointMC` is a class in our code base. The class contains 4 data members of type `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`:. https://github.com/Mu2e/Offline/blob/da4772bcb99f7b42bd401c3b15d56a211124553a/MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh#L209. The `art::InputTag` is `""compressDigiMCs:virtualdetector""` . When I write a small job using `art v3_09_01` to read this data product and print out it's data members, all 4 of the `Hep3Vector` are `(0,0,0)`. When I run the same job using `art v3_06_03` all of the printout is correct. Remember that between `art v3_06_03` and `art v3_09_01` there was a schema change in `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`. You already fixed one bug related to that. I will prepare a stripped down example and add it to this issue. To reproduce. Unwind the following tar file on a machine that sees `/pnfs/mu2e and /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org`; ```; tar xzf /mu2e/app/users/kutschke/Bugs/Hep3Vector/artv3_09.tar.gz ; cd artv3_09; source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh; source setup.sh; scons -j 8; mu2e -c bug.fcl; ```; This prints most of the content of the the `StepPointMCs`. The bug is that the 4 `Hep3Vectors` are **all zero**. It's OK that the non-ionizing and visual energy depositions are zero; this data product captures steps in a virtual detector embedded inside a volume with a vacuum of `10^{-4} torr`. This uses the deprecated Mu2e ""Satellite release"" system to build on top of the Offline tag v10_00_00 on /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/Offline/v10_00_00/SLF7/prof/Offline .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779:130,test,tests,130,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"TLDR: `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` is missing a call to `tree->ResetBranchAddresses()` at the end. The interesting bit is that `TBufferFile::ReadInt` is being used even-though all the variables in the example (and indeed all their corresponding branches) are floats. So the issue is that the address of the Int branch:; ```; *Br 0 :classID : classID/I *; ```; is still set to an address that uses to be on the stack (according to valgrind). How can it be possible, you may ask. Well ... looking at the result of `fOutputFile->ls("""")` we notice:; ```; ....; OBJ: TTree TestTree TestTree : 0 at: 0x5555555eae70; ```; **even before** the call to `fOutputFile.Get(""dataset/TestTree"");`. This means that at point the `TTree` is already in memory (and already setup) and this prior loading is the likely place of the setting of the address to a local variable. It turns out that the `TTree` is created in `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` at `DataSet.cxx:628` and later we have:; ```; UInt_t cls;; ...; tree->Branch( ""classID"", &cls, ""classID/I"" );; ...; return tree;; }; ```; At which point the `tree` is returns pointing to a bunch of now invalid memory location.; Using:; ```; tree->ResetBranchAddresses();; return tree;; }; ```; solves the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300:571,Test,TestTree,571,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300,3,['Test'],['TestTree']
Testability,"TLDR; for reference, the issue is described below. Implicit instantiation of a function template calls `DeclCollector::HandleCXXImplicitFunctionInstantiation()`, which appends the FunctionDecl to the transaction. According to the [docs](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ASTConsumer.html#a880e9a2fd04c8abd5cd218e0a4ed2e56), the body of the function has not yet been instantiated. `HandleTopLevelDecl()` will be called again for this decl at the end of the TU, which will append it again to the transaction -same `Decl *`, different DCI. This is by design. However, unloading of decls in the transaction should _not_ process the same `Decl *` twice. In the reported case, traversing the AST for a second time triggers an assertion failure in `clang::CXXRecordDecl::getLambdaCallOperator()`, as part of the members of the underlying CXXRecordDecl (of a lambda) are not there anymore.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9850#issuecomment-1057247466:731,assert,assertion,731,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9850#issuecomment-1057247466,1,['assert'],['assertion']

Testability,"Tests has been augmented and refactored to avoid code duplication. There's one issue that I'm not sure how to solve: random access iterators are required to support the forms `it + n` as well as `n + it` (where `n` in our case is of type `std::ptrdiff_t`. The second form requires the definition of a free-standing `operator+`, which I implemented this way:. ```c++; template <typename T>; auto operator+(std::ptrdiff_t n, const typename TTreeReaderArray<T>::iterator &it); -> decltype(it + n); {; return it + n;; }; ```.

New tests are still missing, but I would appreciate if you could take another look. In particular, these changes hopefully streamline the code a bit:; * `rdf_uuid`: this was previously not well named, since we need something that contains both an identifier for the current RDataFrame instance and also one for the current (distributed) execution of that RDataFrame (e.g. to separate to consecutive triggers of the computation graph). I have added the type `ExecutionIdentifier` that holds both. This class is now used everywhere (in Ranges.py, HeadNode.py) and should improve readability.; * I merged `CloneResultPtr` and `CloneResultMap` into `CloneResultAndAction`. This helps making the logic in DistRDF more simple (i.e. is what allows the usage of `singledispatch` to distinguish different ways of cloning actions of the distributed computation graph).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12363#issuecomment-1581162133:183,test,tests,183,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12363#issuecomment-1581162133,4,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tests']"

I just tested the following snippet:. ```; import ROOT. while True:; ROOT.TClass.GetClass(""std::vector<int>::value_type""); ```. on:. ```; $ root --version; ROOT Version: 6.24/06; Built for linuxx8664gcc on Sep 02 2021, 14:20:23; From tags/v6-24-06@v6-24-06; ```. Admittedly, we were also making some non-optimal calls to `TClass::GetClass()` and the most reliable way to avoid the issue is to avoid these calls altogether. However, finding the offending calls is a bit of a challenge at the moment.

Why is it exactly important to have all these attributes set? For the ROOT facade itself, it's easy to do (my PR does it in fact), but for arbitrary submodules I wouldn't know what to do. Often, the submodules are represented by C++ namespaces, so all these Python-module related dunder attributes are pretty meaningless. What exactly is your suggestion here?.

That is not done in the current status (there is the `eval` but I don't think it calls directly into cling every time). That's true, but probably `eval` is even worse. It's the `gInterpreter` of Python, which is ""many orders of magnitude slower for smaller expressions/objects than plain ol’ Python"": https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/enhancingperf.html#expression-evaluation-via-eval-experimental. Also, it's more flexible. Since in Python, you have to do `ROOT.kRed`, while gInterpreter can just take `kRed`, there was this hack of adding ""ROOT."" to the string passed to eval, which reduced flexibility and would result in unexpected errors for example when the user does `""1+kRed""` instead of `""kRed+1""`. > * What happens after this change to keyword arguments?

Testability,"Thanks a lot for this PR, that results from very intense debugging sessions initially enabled by @silverweed . Once the tests are green, I think these changes should be merged asap. There is no point in keeping around a fully jitted RDF+TTreeCache if it won't be used any more. After the aforementioned step is completed, we might perhaps think about what can go wrong with used memory and what we can do about it. For example, suppose a workflow with N dataframes.

Can we cap the memory used by the caches? For example we could just keep 1 buffer and assign it to the tree cache of the chain associated to the RDF pulled from the worker's rdfs cache before using that RDF to process data (effectively using 1 single cache). De facto this means assuming N RDFs in flight but one TTreeCache buffer per worker.

Testability,"Thanks for the great comments @guitargeek! All the ones I didn't comment on I agree with, so will implement those soon. I agree that it has become quite a complex class. It would be nice if things could be refactored at some time. However, part of it is also inevitable, I fear, because `RooMinimizer` has to bridge between two rather different frameworks, that of Minuit2 and RooFit, and now due to all the parallel processing work will have to deal with even more stuff than before. By the way, just as a historical aside: at some point I had turned `RooMinimizer` into a fully templated class, which made it even more horrible to maintain and time consuming to develop (since the header had to be recompiled on every change). I managed to trim the template horror down to just the constructor by introducing `RooAbsMinimizerFcn`. That introduced its own complexity here and there, as we discussed above :) But it was better in the end, I think. Note that the sole reason the template parameter is still necessary in the constructor is that the `MinimizerFcn` needs the proper constructor inside the `RooMinimizer` constructor. I like your suggestion of also using the template class argument instead of the `dynamic_cast` using `std::is_same`, but this is not strictly necessary like using the proper constructor is. By the way, note also that in the upcoming TestStatistics PR, there will be yet another `RooMinimizer` constructor, also with template arguments, but different ones, namely the concrete calculator classes for the likelihood and gradient.

Testability,"Thanks for the patch, Advait!. My thoughts: If the function is added to ROOT as is, I'd implement it in the header and simply `return a==b`. The C/C++ cast from `bool` to `int` is effectively a Kronecker Delta. That said, I'm not sure if the function as such does in practice what users expect.

Testability,"Thanks for the pointers, that makes sense! There are two things that still confuse me, however:; 1. When the `std::set` fields PR was merged these errors were not yet present in the CI, even though the test includes a `std::set<pair<int, CustomStruct>>`. In fact, if I go back to the commit right before the maps were added (https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/cddecc1d576df235c38a90295a9fa29a28a8a6b4), this test passes without having to have the dictionary entry for the pair. I cannot pinpoint anything that got added alongside the maps that might change this, but perhaps these additions change the internal build machinery just enough for it to also break without modules enabled.; 2. There are no `std::pair` dictionaries in `core/clingutils/src/*LinkDef.h`. There are a few defined in other places, but none with the numerical types mentioned here. In any case, I will add the above suggestion to make sure that at least we can fail more gracefully (I have not checked with `RTupleField` but I imagine this will also be problematic, so probably this change should be added to `RRecordField`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14084#issuecomment-1822503869:202,test,test,202,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14084#issuecomment-1822503869,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Thanks for the response. The reason I've noticed this PR is because in my instance it appears that it aborted CMake due lack of Java in the build environment. I don't believe the `fail-on-missing` option is turned on (although my CMake knowledge isn't excellent, so perhaps I'm being naive here), so at least in the current HEAD it appears to me to be a mandatory component. If you'd like, you can take a look at the build log here, ; https://github.com/MrCarroll/root-snap/runs/2059798478?check_suite_focus=true#step:3:3399. I've no technical reason against including Java in the snap to enable this functionality, but I don't believe it's functionality the users of the snap would likely expect it to have, it's primarily targetted to users who aren't likely to have access to a cluster to use. You can treat the snap as effectively being an instance of Ubuntu 20.04; if you'd like I can try see if I have the same problem in the normal Ubuntu environment to see if it reproduces there. Otherwise I'll likely pass the explicit flag to turn this off in my instance if it does appear to be a problem specific to the snap build.

Testability,"Thanks for you reply @couet, I see your point that it's not ideal to define an attribute that is only used by approximatly half of all available styles. The main reason I wanted to have this feature is that I realized that lines with a width of 1 can become badly visible in presentations or on posters which is why I prefer to use line width 2 as default everywhere. For the implementation via the marker styles as you propose I see basically 2 ways to implement this:; 1. At the moment we have marker styles up to 49. One could just start to redefine all existing marker styles where a linewidth makes sense from 50 upwards with a linewidth of 1, 2, 3 ...; However, I think this might become confusing if further styles are added in the future, because then there will be no logic behind the numbers and the corresponding markers, although there is not much logic behind the style numbers right now too.; 2. One could define it in a way that adding 100 to the marker style corresponds to an increase of the linewidth of 1. As an example the regular + marker with linewidth 1 would be 2, with linewidth 2 it would be 102, with linewidth 3 202 ...; I know this would be rather equal to defining a standalone linewidth attribute, but it would allow us to add up to 50 additional marker styles in the future without breaking the logic and I doubt we will have more than 100 different marker styles one day.

Next thing I don't understand:. > If the root objects all had some kind of empty non-displayed initial state, and their own reset() re-initializer, we wouldn't even need the unique_ptr. How does that solve the storage duration? Suppose I run `script1.C` and `script2.C`, both create histograms, and I want to compare them. What do I do in your hypothetical ""some kind of empty non-displayed initial state"" case?. > I'd likely use static instead of the namespace, but the root interpreter doesn't respect translation unit boundaries well. For cling, input is growing the same translation unit. That's how; ```; root [0] int i = 23l; root [1] int j = ++i;; ```; works, for instance. You example creates a global, just as `Heap::Create` does.

Testability,"The issue needs to be looked at from the C++ and PyROOT perspective with a programming model in mind. But let me start from the technical answers, which are easier:; 1) The memory taken by the ""entry number custom column"" is one 64 bit integer per slot, so negligible; 2) Correct: Both slot and entry number are available at the TDF level, the difficulty is to percolate them in the actual function in the define/filter. Focussing only on C++, one could think about a ""TDF::EntryNumber"" type. We could detect it if used as first argument of the function passed and pass the entry. Such type will be transparently convertible to a 64-bits integer. As a side note, also the slot could be treated similarly. The issue will be in PyROOT, with filters and defines expressed as strings which are then jitted: these types make sense only if present in the signature of the function. If we go for the custom column solution, we know exactly what to do, we tested heavily all the components involved but we have to choose a name: ""__TDF_iEntry"", ""__Entry"", ""__iEntry"" .; Certainly starting with a ""__slot"" and ""__entry"" could be very attractive since it will provide ; a.

Testability,"The problem is not in `GetLeaf()`, so we do not need to add support for this there, especially since it breaks tests. We just have to do the right name split in TDF and pass that to another overload of `GetLeaf()` that takes the already split arguments. The real problem is that once branch names with dots start being accepted by TDF, the JIT doesn't work because the string for jitting contains the branch names as is, so things like `double p.x;` show up in the code to be jitted, and that cannot be compiled, so that's what really needs fixing.

Testability,"The problem is that LLVM ships with zlib. Since recently, we meld the header files of the PCH in a zip in it (fa9a2eee8376a0d4c4393b8f94fa3f841455c32d). Clang uses zlib [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L1302) and [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTWriter.cpp#L2052) when building the PCH in `-fmodules-embed-all-files` mode. IIUC, the issue is the way the JIT resolves symbols. Currently, cling's JIT gives a preference to the local content to itself, i.e. resolves symbols from libCling.so first. This would mean that even if we link another version of zlib to libCore, cling will still find the symbols from llvm's library. And that's by design, because we want to resolve the embedded in ROOT LLVM symbols first. Otherwise cling will start picking up random LLVM symbols introducing a lot of compatibility and versioning issues. I'd propose we try to solve this in two steps. First we should try disabling LLVM's zlib from `interpreter/CMakeLists.txt` instead of the current patch. I suspect that LLVM will be able to find and use the system's zlib (in that case we should make sure LLVM links to the version of zlib we expect: @oshadura has a nice test case for it). If that doesn't work we should investigate how we can configure ROOT's LLVM with a custom zlib.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847:1315,test,test,1315,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"The problem is that RDF tries to open the file to check that it's valid. The logic for the file opening is at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/962009b8c2057199c2229c3ef9938ac4d315d10a/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L1133 . In particular, because of the presence of the `?` token, the string is parsed as a glob. Now in many cases that would be harmless albeit a tiny overhead (it would just return the same file name to open), but in this particular case it triggers a faulty behaviour. The glob parsing attempts at traversing the remote xrootd directory (see [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/962009b8c2057199c2229c3ef9938ac4d315d10a/tree/tree/src/InternalTreeUtils.cxx#L471)), but since the permission is just for the single file with the token and not for the entire directory, it leads to the `user access restricted` error you post above. Now, I believe the most sane course of action would be to refine the logic that checks whether the input file name is a glob. I could simply add a check for the `xrd.wantprot` token, but probably we want to have a more authoritative list of all the tokens that should make the file name not be parsed as a glob. This probably includes not only xrootd tokens but also anything https-related. Or we could adopt a different strategy for glob detection altogether.

Testability,"The second ""bigger"" problem are the `filemerger` tests on macOS AArch64 that compare the expected compressed file size of `hsimple.root`. These turn out to be caused by how LLVM 16 optimizes `pz = px*px + py*py;` in `hsimple.C`, resulting in slightly different floating point results and therefore different compression. I have no really good solution here other than updating the expected reference sizes / their tolerance. An alternative would be to check in a ""known"" `hsimple.root` and not generate it on the fly.

There was the necessity to start testing a certain subset of TMVA, which was never tested before (see https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15197); 2. The packages were added to `requirements.txt` so that the docker images built for Linux runners of the new CI infrastructure could pick them up (the images are built nightly and they install in the virtual environment of the docker container all the packages in `requirements.txt` available in `master` at the time of building the image).; 3.

Testability,"This will avoid the crashing due to an uninitialized pool, but might cause problems as we are not enabling thread safety (as we shouldn't inside TTreeProcessorMT). In any case, maybe we should add an explanation comment? A big warning about thread safety?.

Testability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:482,test,testing,482,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Three questions from my side (may be naive because I didn't spend a lot of time to fully digest the CI setup):; 1. Having the secrets stored as a file on the runners means we commit to self-hosted machines? GitHub hosted runners won't have the necessary setup.; 2. The workflow run ""would still have to be approved by a maintainer."" - how does this work? https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/ discusses a label; as far as I understand approval on GitHub itself is limited to first-time contributions. So everybody ""external"" who got one benign PR accepted, can afterwards run potentially malicious code without approval, no?; 3. ""A safer alternative is not allowing pull request jobs to upload artifacts at all but then we can't run tests in a separate job. It would also cause builds to take more time on average because the object storage will be less populated."" What is the currently intended use case for this?

Testability,"To add some more information after some investigation with @vepadulano: when doing `ROOT.Detail.MyStruct`, the `Detail` namespace that PyROOT returns is the one in the global namespace, i.e. `Detail`, not `ROOT::Detail`. This happens because, when doing a lookup from Python in the `ROOT` module, the global namespace is inspected first, and only if that lookup fails the `ROOT` namespace is tried. But since `Detail` already exists in the global namespace, `ROOT::Detail` is never returned - and `Detail` does not contain any `MyStruct`. Bottom line: the PyROOT lookup works as expected. That being said, we found a weird behavior with the `Detail` namespace, which can be reproduced from Python and also from C++ in the ROOT prompt:. ```; root [0] auto c = TClass::GetClass(""Detail""); (TClass *) @0x7fffd0908fc0; root [1] namespace Detail { int i; }; root.exe: /home/etejedor/root/fork/root/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:105: static bool llvm::isa_impl_cl<To, const From*>::doit(const From*) [with To = clang::TagType; From = clang::Type]: Assertion `Val && ""isa<> used on a null pointer""' failed.; ```.

ROOT::RDataFrame df = ROOT::RDataFrame(10);; auto df2 = df.Define(""x"", ""rdfentry_"").Define(""x2"", ""rdfentry_*rdfentry_"");; ; std::vector<TH1D*> histos;; auto h1 = df2.Histo1D({""h1"", ""h1; x; x"", 100, 0, 100}, ""x"");; auto h2 = df2.Histo1D({""h2"", ""h2; x; x2"", 100, 0, 100}, ""x2"");; histos.push_back(h1.GetPtr());; histos.push_back(h2.GetPtr());. for (auto* h : histos){; TCanvas* canvas = new TCanvas( Form(""%s"", h->GetName()) );; h->DrawClone();; std::cout<<""Successfully plotted the histogram. Please type something to get the next one: ""<<std::endl;; std::string dummy;; std::cin>> dummy;; }; }; ```; After running `root test.cpp` I get the output in the following order:. 1. ""Successfully plotted the histogram. Please type something to get the next one:"" from std::cout; 2. I send ""42"" for std::cin request; 3. ""Successfully plotted the histogram. Please type something to get the next one:"" from std::cout; **and single blank canvas appears**; 4. I send ""42"" for std::cin request; 5. **Two canvases filled with two histograms appear**. The order seems off from expected ""histogram per iteration"" logic and plotting happens at the very end of the for loop.; @couet could you reproduce this?. I assume this is reasonable with `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT();`, if the same happens with python then not all canvases might be alive in the end..

Testability,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:23,test,tests,23,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

TODO:; - [x] The test for histograms only works when calling the `Histo1D` action without a `TH1DModel`. In that case `ROOT::Detail::RDF::GetMergeableValue()` returns a `nullptr`.

Testability,"Using `.L` or `__attribute__((constructor))` or static initialization are good alternatives. However that does not improve usability of `.x` .; As mentioned in the first post, entry function still need renaming when file get renamed.; Also we get function redefinition error when `.x` or `.L` two scripts with same name. For example `dir0/test.C` and `dir1/dir2/test.C` (with completely different content) cannot both define their `test(...)` entry functions. They cannot be put into different namespaces either otherwise cling does not recognize them as entry functions. However, `__main__(...)` approach suffers from multiple definitions too.

Testability,"We are no longer updating the old I/O (the one you get without the `+`) as its test suite is minimal and we have no idea what users still using are relying on. However you can straightforwardly migrate to the new I/O and solve the problem for you classes. The result of the process applied to your example can be seen in the merge request against your example: https://github.com/karuboniru/root_memory_leak_report/pull/1. This was created (beside the small tidying commits) by:. 1. Generating the dictionary without the `+`.; 2. Copy/pasting the Streamer member function for the class from the dictionary and switch to custom streamer by adding `-` to the LinDef: [karuboniru/root_memory_leak_report@`f454e98` (#1)](https://github.com/karuboniru/root_memory_leak_report/pull/1/commits/f454e9875ba71c9528b5e8a5f289681d35e41877). After this steps, there is no change in behavior yet. 3. Go back to the previous code, Generate the dictionary with the '+', this gives the Streamer function that uses the new I/O. Save the code for the next step (Note that the code is entirely boiler plate and with 2 substitutions applies to any class.; 4. Go back to the new code.; 5. Increase the class version number; 6. Replace the write part of the Streamer function with the new I/O version. Merge the read part of the new I/O into to the read part, keeping the old code to only read the data from the old files. This accomplish in [karuboniru/root_memory_leak_report@`37d09c9` (#1)](https://github.com/karuboniru/root_memory_leak_report/pull/1/commits/37d09c96d41744cb524e30aca77a64fe977d8a44)?diff=split . After this step the new code will write and read new file without a memory lead. It will be able to read the old file with the same memory as before. 7.

Testability,"Well, actually it was less work than I thought.; I implemented now all the additions, changes and suggestions from @lmoneta. I used now std::vector everywhere it's features are useful. For the rest I stayed with using arrays to stay similar to all other TGraph objects. I moved the functions GetPointX, GetPointY, SetPointX, SetPointY and GetObjectInfo to the TGraph class because they apply to any TGraph object and only were in my custom class cause I could not implement them in TGraph without using a custom Root installation. I replaced the funtion SetNErrorDimensions by the functions AddYError and DeleteYError as proposed by @lmoneta. Since I think the meaning of ""dimension"" might not be 100% clear, I exchanged it to a term claryfing that it corresponds to different y errors. Besides that I implemented some further features and fixed a memory leak in the function PaintGraphMultiErrors in the TGraphPainter class.

The fourth commit is a bug fix, but since it is a rather rare bug that is only triggered in pathological cases (that I happened to trigger in one of the tests added in commit 3) and since it interacts with a specific other part (cache-and-tracking), I thought it was better to keep it separate, so that the commit can explain the rationale for that specific fix well.; 5. Commit 5 is again a minor refactoring to reduce some duplicated code.; 6. Commit 6 adds a strong warning message when fits end after only having tried parameters that give evaluation errors. In such a case, there will not actually be any valid value, but rather the error handling code will return zero as the function value. Minuit sees this as a valid function value and thinks the function converged and so RooFit would also think everything ended well. With this commit, at least a warning is issued.

Testability,Will be a hard task for me than to build and test the documentation. . As a side note did you ever think about using doxygen tag files? A project that extensively uses doxygen tag files for their project is the CGAL project (See https://www.cgal.org/ and https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html). It is not easy to build and initially it takes also a complete doxygen run (to create a.o. the tag files) but later on it is possible to build individual manuals / subprojects.

Testability,"Yep, it's an ABI issue: On AArch64, integers with less than 32 bits (including `short`s) are promoted to 32 bits - so far, so good, everybody agrees on that. Where things start to differ is *how* to do that, Darwin expects extension whereas the generic method is ""direct"". I suppose the latter means filling with zeros in practice, so `(short)-1 = 0xffff -> 0x0000ffff = 65535`.

Testability,"Yes, better than the ""That should fix a recent nightly failure with gcc11"" that Philippe commented on, thanks for improving it!.

In general we tell our users (+/- always) ""can we please see the actual diagnostic"", and for the same reasons it's super helpful to include them here. The time we discussed this is waaay larger than the time it would have taken you to update the log to what Philippe proposes, rather than updating it to something that tries to address the issues (but seemingly fails?).

Testability,"You convinced me that the subevent-section tests should be `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`. > From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. You are right! This can easily be confirmed (even just on my x86 laptop) by changing the seed on line 66. Setting it to some other values, the `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fails sometimes (e.g. seed = 24) and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` as well (e.g. seed = 255). Some seeds even make multiple tests fail, e.g. 25534 fails `BinnedDatasetTest.EventSections` and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` and 2 makes both `SimBinnedConstrainedTest` event-splitting tests fail. I was not able to find a seed that fails the other tests, so it seems to be contained to the `*EventSections` tests. To be complete, I think we should add the explanation of why this comparison doesn't work, which is that **the calculations are**, in fact, **different**. We're comparing a single-section (""all events"") calculation to multi-section (""events section 1"" + ""section 2"" + ...). Obviously, this can give differences due to rounding from FMA or just Kahan summation which also has a small error sometimes. In other tests in the `RooAbsL` and other `RooFit::TestStatistics` suite, this doesn't typically apply. In most of the tests, we're trying to do the exact same calculation (""same"" in terms of CPU operations as well), except either in parallel or through the `TestStatistics` classes instead of the old `RooNLLVar` tree. Sometimes different ordering can change results, like the extended term you mentioned, but also the subsidiary term. Anyway, for this PR: I will suggest an explanation comment and after that it can be merged (@guitargeek agrees, we discussed it in the RooFit dev meeting just now). I will also open an issue reminding us to also apply this change to the two `EventSections` tests.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1550987204:43,test,tests,43,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1550987204,10,"['Test', 'test']","['TestStatistics', 'tests']"

Testability,"You're right! I misunderstood, I thought `std::rotate` rotated the whole iterable (e.g. like https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html), but I see now it only puts the selected part in front and shoves the rest aside to make room. But then apparently there are still situations that we are not catching. I think probably sometimes there will be yet another task executed before all tasks are in the queue. This is of course always possible, because the OS can delay processes and IPC in any way it sees fit. I can up the sleep time to compensate for this so it happens less often, but it is by the nature of the algorithm unavoidable that some statistical failures will still happen (given slow enough OS'es). What we can do to make sure that the test never fails is to iteratively go through all received tasks and modify the expected order until it matches, but of course in the extreme case that every step is reordered this would then defeat the purpose of the test. A more robust approach would be to wait with taking work off the queue until all tasks have been submitted, but this is not actually desirable functionality, because that would mean workers would be doing nothing when they could already be working. Introducing such functionality just for testing purposes seems silly. So not sure how to ""fix"" this.
