Deployability,"Hello, . I'm very new to model training and honestly, coding, so thank you for your patience! I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. ; First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. . Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. .

Deployability,"Hello, . I've been attempting to use the customized_classes_labeler to train a DeepVariant model. Specifically, I've been trying use the ""callsets"" field from the INFO field of a Genome In A Bottle VCF file. I've been working with NA12878, VCF/BED files available here: ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/NA12878_HG001/latest/GRCh38/. At first, I could not make training examples using this as that field is an integer, but by making a copy of the VCF where I changed that field to be a string, I was able to make examples (using the `--labeler algorithm`, `--customized_classes_labeler_info_field_name`, and `--customized_classes_labeler_classes_list` options) and train the model. However, when I use the best model from training to predict variants, this class label information is not included in the VCF file. Am I misinterpreting how to use this customized class labeling? Any suggestions on how to incorporate this field into training and variant prediction?

Deployability,"Hello,. I'm using DeepVariant docker container v1.3 to call variants using the `run_deepvariant` command. What I've done in the past to manage temp files was to create a `temp_dir` in the working directory and then use `--intermediate_results_dir temp_dir` to make DeepVariant write temp files in this custom location. However, the same approach is not working anymore for me in the new HPC system since on computing node the default temp folder stored in `$TMPDIR` is set to a special space `\localscratch` that is not among the path automatically mounted by Docker or Singularity (like \tmp) apparently. I realized that, in addition to intermediate files written to `--intermediate_results_dir`, DeepVariant writes some additional temp files to the default temp dir location (`$TMPDIR`) and this created some issues when running it in pipelines (like Nextflow). . I've created a work around by manually setting `$TMPDIR` in the sh script so that it points to another folder in the work directory, and I can see there are a bunch of small files created in there (~30Mb total) like the following; ```; Bazel.runfiles_6nvtcv_j __pycache__ tmp8rz89h3g.py tmpglc9d5x3.py tmph9ntzkbx; ```.

Deployability,"Hello,. I've been using DeepTrio for de novo variant analysis, and it's been performing excellently. However, I noticed from the logs that DeepTrio uses the CPU to prepare data, which is quite time-consuming. In my case, it took 12 hours for one trio analysis, with an additional 4 hours on the GPU. Given that renting GPU servers( usually with less CPU) is more expensive than CPU servers and access to privately owned GPU servers is limited, it seems inefficient to run lengthy CPU processes on a GPU server. It feels like a bit of a waste, and sometimes I half-jokingly feel there might be someone out there with murderous intent because of it!. Would it be possible in future updates to partition the DeepTrio analysis into separate steps? This way, CPU-intensive tasks could be completed on a CPU server, and then the job could be transferred to a GPU server for the remaining tasks. Alternatively, could the data preparation (CPU) and analysis (GPU) be run at the same time? This would help optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

Deployability,"Hello,. We have found that a known de novo variant was missed when using DeepTrio and GLnexus in our pipeline (WGS, hg38). I know that a similar issue has already been raised and appreciate the interesting discussion on this (i.e. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440), but to recap for others this was the result of two contributing factors:. 1. DeepTrio being less confident in the de novo call for the proband than when DeepVariant is run in singleton mode on the proband. In our case, comparing the output VCFs from these two different runs we saw a reduction in the GQ score assigned to the variant from 56 when using DeepVariant in singleton mode, to only 10 when using DeepTrio.; 2. GLnexus filtering, according to the `DeepVariantWGS` configuration we were using, removing our variant of interest in the case of DeepTrio due to the low likelihood assigned to the call. To partly overcome this we are looking to switch the GLnexus configuration to `DeepVariant_unfiltered` as mentioned in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440. However we would like to further evaluate this change on a known truth set to determine the increase in false-positive calls (similar to [1] with DV-GLN-NOMOD vs DV-GLN-OPT, but for DeepTrio instead... because from what I understand that paper evaluated DeepVariant). I have seen that all three GIAB/NIST benchmark trios have been used as training data for DeepTrio so would like to ask:. 1. Were all chromosomes from these trios used to train the DeepTrio models? I believe the DeepVariant WGS training data excluded chr20-22, and the deeptrio test data uses HG001 Chr20 [2], so I assume chr20-22 were excluded from the Deeptrio models for each of the trios too and would be suitable for testing? Or any alternative suggestions for this?; 2. I understand that the DeepTrio docs aren't officially released yet, but would it be possible please to provide an overview of the workings and differences between the Child and Parent models for DeepT",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475:101,pipeline,pipeline,101,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475,3,"['configurat', 'pipeline']","['configuration', 'pipeline']"
Deployability,"Hello,. We noticed that adjacent variants of the same haplotype (i.e. MNVs) are being called as separate variants in the DeepVariant and DeepTrio outputs with VCF and gVCF files. During downstream processing these MNVs are then treated as two individual SNVs at two different loci, leading to faulty assessments. . For example two variants for a site of interest (reference TCG -> Serine) were separated between two lines in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio output VCF and then categorised as containing a nonsynonymous (T**G**G -> Tryptophan) and synonymous mutation (TC**A** -> Serine). Whereas the correct and desired way to handle this, at least for us but I imagine others too, would seem to be to recognise both mutations on a single line in the VCF as a combined substitution, which could then be identified as resulting in a stopgain (T**GA** -> Nonsense mutation). Are there plans to support these MNV calls in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio outputs? Or alternatively are there any current post-processing approaches that you may be using and can recommend to handle these cases? Can understand these may be challenging to manage in some aspects but could be important to flag given some recent literature around this topic. For reference this was using hg38 with WGS. We initially identified this using the original DeepTrio release (docker image deeptrio:1.0.1rc), but then also using the most recent DeepVariant release (via docker, v1.2). We also tested this to see whether the change to the unfiltered GLnexus config could be contributing to this for processing of DeepTrio gVCFs due to the joint genotyping parameter, but reverting back to the WGS config did not result in a merged MNV in this instance. .

Deployability,"Hi DeepVariant team,. I'm running DeepVariant via Singularity via Snakemake on a HPC cluster and overall, if I create an interactive session, my entire WES pipeline runs fine until an odd DeepVariant job fails (by that I mean that let's say 30 deepvariant jobs finish ok and the 31st fails). I can then restart the Snakemake run and the same job will run fine, followed by more jobs that will also run fine until another odd jobs fails. This is also particularly true when I use the --cluster command in Snakemake (i.e., send it to a SLURM job scheduler from the master node) - in this event every single job fails. I could of course run all my samples on a single interactive session, keep checking the log file and restart the run every time it fails but I guess that's less than optimal plus this way I can really only run one sample at the time. For the interactive sessions I request 180G and 64cpus (in my case it's: ```srsh --mem=180G --cpus-per-task=64 --partition=long```). .

Deployability,"Hi all;; Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility.; - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22; - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process.

The images for SNP sites and deletions seem to be straightforward, but I found those for insertions are rather confusing. The reference lines for insertion sites are still continuous, and at the point where the insertion happens, the bases on the sequenced reads are set to 0.

The problem is these images are not presenting detailed infomation for the inserted sequence, and on sites where multiple insertions happen, the ""supports variant"" channel might become the only useful infomation to distinguish them.; Also, on the ""base quality"" channel, the qualities for these 0-bases are not zeros, how are these values determined?.

Then I ran DeepVariant as follows:; ```; singularity exec -B ${SOME_PATHS} deepvariant_1.2.0.sif bash /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant --model_type PACBIO --ref ${PATH_TO_REF} --reads MARGIN_PHASED.PEPPER_SNP_MARGIN.happlotagged.bam --output_vcf sample.vcf.gz --output_gvcf sample.g.vcf.gz --num_shards 24 --make_examples_extra_args=""realign_reads=false,min_mapping_quality=5"" --sample_name MYSAMPLE --use-hp-information;; ```. I have two problems:; 1. Right from the beginning (`CALL VARIANT MODULE SELECTED`), for each interval processed. I get thousands of `READ TAG: n_elements is zero` messages in the console. What does it mean and is it a problem or just a warning?; 2. I allocate 200GB of RAM for per job and they all seem to systematically fail on memory. I do not recall DeepVariant using that much memory in the past but I might be wrong. Is 200GB too light for a human genome PacBio Hifi 30x coverage dataset?.

Deployability,"Hi,. I am using [Pepper-MARGIN-DeepVariant r0.7](https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper) with custom made models for Pepper-SNP, Pepper-HP and DeepVariant.

I have run this pipeline successfully for a small cohort of about 100 genomes but when merging the GVCF files, [GLnexus 1.4.1](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus) (with config `DeepVariant`) complains that at least one variant is missing PL values.

A	G	9.9	refCall	.	GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:C	./.:0:5:0:0:DV; ```; The VCF record indicates that the variant call was issued by DeepVariant. . Any ideas what could be the issue here?.

Deployability,"I'm trying to build a scatter gather implementation of make_calls -> call_variants -> post_processing, without using GNU parallel, and since multiple shards of call_variants, even with num_readers set to 1, increases the system load well beyond the number of cores, I'd like to try to limit this to a 1:1 ratio where one shard produces a system load of 1. Is this possible?. This is essentially what my pipeline looks like today: https://github.com/oskarvid/wdl_deepvariant/blob/master/deepvar-simple-SG.wdl; I say essentially because I've made insignificant changes, like added --num_readers for example. . One way would be to try to combine all tfrecord files into one, because wdl cannot use your method of using all output files from make_calls as input files for call_variants, inputFile@#shards.gz doesn't compute for wdl, and using wdl's normal way of handling multiple input files, i.e ""--examples ${sep="" --examples "" InputFile}"" doesn't work either since call_variants only takes the last ""--examples"" as input when there are many ""--examples"" in the command. Regarding combining the tfrecord files before they're used as input for call_variants, I'm not familiar enough with tensorflow to know if it's at all possible, and a quick google search didn't return anything fruitful.

Without or not familiar with a Ubuntu system, it's hard to figure out what would be the equivalent.

Deployability,"client. '; RuntimeError: Missing runtime dependency on the Google API client. Run `pip install cloud-tpu-client` to fix. ```; However, cloud-tpu-client is not actually the problem. The issue is that `google.api_core.client_options` is not found when being imported from `googleapiclient.discovery`. The issue appears to be the [python3.3 _ _ init _ _.py trap](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-init-py-trap) where one python module is blocking another from being found. In the python path there is a `google` module with an `__init__.py` found here, `/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_461ld2s6/runfiles/com_google_protobuf/python/google/__init__.py`, while running. That may be blocking the discovery of `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py`. **Work Around**. I think configuring Bazel to avoid the issue is probably the right way to fix this, but I worked around the issue by patching `googleapiclient.discovery` with the following patch:. ```; 49c49,59; < import google.api_core.client_options; ---; > ; > # Mega hack to avoid init.py trap of google/init.py which is somewhere on the path; > # Make a namespace to hold our module; > import types; > google = types.SimpleNamespace(); > google.api_core = types.SimpleNamespace(); > # Directly import our module into the namespace; > import importlib.util; > spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(""google.api_core.client_options"", ""/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py""); > google.api_core.client_options = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); > spec.loader.exec_module(google.api_core.client_options); ```; This manually imports the required module, which only works because we know the path won't change in our docker image and we know `googleapiclient.discovery` only uses `client_options.py`. Finally, make a new docker image with this patch by calling it discovery.patch and using this Dockerfile:. ```; ARG VERSION=1.1.0.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/469:3790,patch,patch,3790,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/469,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"e term ""DeepVariant"" or ""Google"" any where. I apologize for missing something that a lot of people might know, but would you mind explaining how the results in the [PrecisionFDA results table](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/truth/results) match DeepVariant?. **2)** While it has been hard for me explain myself precisely, I have been concerned that there was somehow over-fitting for some datasets reporting extremely high accuracy. In the PrecisionFDA challenge, I think it should probably be mentioned that there are multiple programs with high percentages, including different workflows that actually use the same variant caller (like GATK) and no strategy was ""best"" for all the criteria defined. **3)** While I don't know the precise way in which you could have a lack of independence for training versus test datasets, I think there are other benchmarks that better match what I would expect for more typical results. For example, [in this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0054-x), it says ""_In the high-confidence regions, when comparing these pipelines to each other (https://precision.fda.gov/jobs/job-FJpqBP80F3YyfJG02bQzPJBj, link immediately accessible by requesting an account), they agreed on 99.7% of SNVs and 98.7% of indels. Outside the high-confidence regions (https://precision.fda.gov/jobs/job-FJpqJF80F3YyXqz6Kv8Q1BQK), they agreed with each other on only 76.5% of SNVs and 78.7% of indels_."". **4)** You mention ""_No filtering is needed beyond setting your preferred minimum quality threshold_."". While I don't currently have much first-hand experience (although that is on my long-term ""to-do"" list), I didn't think this was true. For example, unless I am missing something, this table reports a very high ""Failed Filters"" count for DeepVariant versus GATK:. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36177-7/tables/1. Do you have other metrics with comparisons on completely independent samples?. Thank you very much for your help!.

Deployability,"h the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. ; First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. . Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. . Best, ; Haley .

I suspect there may be some more complications that I need to learn about (in terms of running Docker on Google Cloud, *using data stored in a Google Cloud Bucket*), but the messages that I get are different when using the DeepVariant container versus my own container.

Deployability,"iousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-init-py-trap) where one python module is blocking another from being found. In the python path there is a `google` module with an `__init__.py` found here, `/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_461ld2s6/runfiles/com_google_protobuf/python/google/__init__.py`, while running. That may be blocking the discovery of `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py`. **Work Around**. I think configuring Bazel to avoid the issue is probably the right way to fix this, but I worked around the issue by patching `googleapiclient.discovery` with the following patch:. ```; 49c49,59; < import google.api_core.client_options; ---; > ; > # Mega hack to avoid init.py trap of google/init.py which is somewhere on the path; > # Make a namespace to hold our module; > import types; > google = types.SimpleNamespace(); > google.api_core = types.SimpleNamespace(); > # Directly import our module into the namespace; > import importlib.util; > spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(""google.api_core.client_options"", ""/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py""); > google.api_core.client_options = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); > spec.loader.exec_module(google.api_core.client_options); ```; This manually imports the required module, which only works because we know the path won't change in our docker image and we know `googleapiclient.discovery` only uses `client_options.py`. Finally, make a new docker image with this patch by calling it discovery.patch and using this Dockerfile:. ```; ARG VERSION=1.1.0. FROM google/deepvariant:""${VERSION}""-gpu. RUN python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade pip; RUN python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall cloud-tpu-client. WORKDIR /opt/deepvariant.

This confirmed for me that I don't have AVX support.

I think it'll make it a bit easier for many users to adopt this nice pipeline.

However, have you considered allowing users to upload their run-time information (and estimated costs) to a program that might be able to help estimate run-time and cost (to possible help with topic **1a)**, **in the long-term**)?. Since `gcp_deepvariant_runner` avoids the possibility of delays between running steps (and has an exist status depending upon whether variant calling was successful), perhaps some sort of optional reporting to an anonymized database could be provided as a parameter for that?. **2)** While I realize it could be considered a cross-post, I am trying to test running each of the 3 steps run separately on Google Cloud (instead of using `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines`). I have some notes on this [Stack Overflow post]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624506/running-docker-on-google-cloud-instance-with-data-in-gcsfuse-mounted-bucket) about the details of my installation and running of Docker on Google Cloud. I suspect there may be some more complications that I need to learn about (in terms of running Docker on Google Cloud, *using data stored in a Google Cloud Bucket*), but the messages that I get are different when using the DeepVariant container versus my own container. So, I thought it might be OK to post a question here. If I try to run [a script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud that is similar to AWS (and based upon the very helpful [DeepVariant Exome Case Study]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md)), I get the following error message:. ```; $ sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists...

Run `pip install cloud-tpu-client` to fix. ```; However, cloud-tpu-client is not actually the problem. The issue is that `google.api_core.client_options` is not found when being imported from `googleapiclient.discovery`. The issue appears to be the [python3.3 _ _ init _ _.py trap](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-init-py-trap) where one python module is blocking another from being found. In the python path there is a `google` module with an `__init__.py` found here, `/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_461ld2s6/runfiles/com_google_protobuf/python/google/__init__.py`, while running. That may be blocking the discovery of `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py`. **Work Around**.

Deployability,"tput VCFs from these two different runs we saw a reduction in the GQ score assigned to the variant from 56 when using DeepVariant in singleton mode, to only 10 when using DeepTrio.; 2. GLnexus filtering, according to the `DeepVariantWGS` configuration we were using, removing our variant of interest in the case of DeepTrio due to the low likelihood assigned to the call. To partly overcome this we are looking to switch the GLnexus configuration to `DeepVariant_unfiltered` as mentioned in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440. However we would like to further evaluate this change on a known truth set to determine the increase in false-positive calls (similar to [1] with DV-GLN-NOMOD vs DV-GLN-OPT, but for DeepTrio instead... because from what I understand that paper evaluated DeepVariant). I have seen that all three GIAB/NIST benchmark trios have been used as training data for DeepTrio so would like to ask:. 1. Were all chromosomes from these trios used to train the DeepTrio models? I believe the DeepVariant WGS training data excluded chr20-22, and the deeptrio test data uses HG001 Chr20 [2], so I assume chr20-22 were excluded from the Deeptrio models for each of the trios too and would be suitable for testing? Or any alternative suggestions for this?; 2. I understand that the DeepTrio docs aren't officially released yet, but would it be possible please to provide an overview of the workings and differences between the Child and Parent models for DeepTrio? Is there a reason why the HG001/NA12891/NA12892 trios were used as training for the child model but not the parent model?. <br>.

Which was based on this example: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/scripts/run_wgs_case_study_docker.sh. I would have expected the naming scheme to match the pattern I specified instead of the 000*-of-00064... strange. Now I am trying to move on to the next step, but again having trouble figuring out how to deal with these multiple example files /sharding when passing them as inputs to the call_variants step. . In the example, it recommends:. ```; ## Run `call_variants`; echo ""Start running call_variants...Log will be in the terminal and also to ${LOG_DIR}/call_variants.log.""; ( time sudo docker run \; -v ""${BASE}"":""${BASE}"" \; gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/call_variants \; --outfile ""${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT}"" \; --examples ""${EXAMPLES}"" \; --checkpoint ""${MODEL}""; ) 2>&1 | tee ""${LOG_DIR}/call_variants.log""; echo ""Done.""; echo; ```. Is there some magic pattern recognition that knows to look for files of the format 000*-of-00064? Confused as to how I should do this; should I run call_variants on 64 separate machines, with each machine running a job on one of the sharded make_examples outputs? When I try incorporating the code recommended in the example workflow, I get the following error:. `ValueError: Cannot find matching files with the pattern ""test.examples.tfrecord@64.gz""`. So obviously not working out of the box as specified. But I'm not sure whether call_variants is intelligent to handle sharded examples or if I should be explicitly only running it once on each shard and then somehow merging all the vcfs after or something. And where in this shading would post processing of variants fit in to generate the VCF -- can that be part of a reduce step pulling all sharded call_variants outputs together one one machine?

Energy Efficiency,"Hello, ; I think the answer is ""yes I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage illumina data. But mapping them on the rotifer genomes is a nightmare, it seems there are many mismappings. But ... we finally start to have enough material to get long ONT precise reads (the very last one that is accurate at 99.99%, just like a giant PCR); those are much less likely to mismap, and Clair3 seems extremely powerful and precise to call. Therefore, we could consider the call from long reads as a ""truth set"". . My point is if I give deep variant the ONT ""truth set"" and then the mapping of short illumina reads. Could it be retrained to understand the mapping and calling issues with this kind of genome? I don't have a ""rule"" such as Mendelian violation because my organism is clonal. Therefore, the only possibility of having a ""truth set"" is to trust long reads mapping (Sanger sequencing doesn't work well either; we don't know why). . Is it something doable? I could use other things, such as Python random forests, as suggested by a colleague, but since you have spent a lot of time trying to help me, before, I found it gentlemanly to ask if we can use Deepvariant.; I think the answer is ""Yes, I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage Illumina data. And I'm not sure I will get those datasets resequenced in long reads with enough coverage and N50 (for another reason we don't understand well, DNA extraction is harrowing in rotifers; it often fails or yields highly damaged DNA). Therefore, if I could retrain a model to use the Illumina datasets, that would be great. . My worries are: what does it take in terms of hardware to retrain Deepvariant? I don't have access to a huge GPU. . I found this tutorial: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md . but I am not sure if it is adapted to my case, streamlined, or can be done here, if I understand well this example relies on using Google machines, right?.

Energy Efficiency,"Hello,. I've been using DeepTrio for de novo variant analysis, and it's been performing excellently. However, I noticed from the logs that DeepTrio uses the CPU to prepare data, which is quite time-consuming. In my case, it took 12 hours for one trio analysis, with an additional 4 hours on the GPU. Given that renting GPU servers( usually with less CPU) is more expensive than CPU servers and access to privately owned GPU servers is limited, it seems inefficient to run lengthy CPU processes on a GPU server. It feels like a bit of a waste, and sometimes I half-jokingly feel there might be someone out there with murderous intent because of it!. Would it be possible in future updates to partition the DeepTrio analysis into separate steps? This way, CPU-intensive tasks could be completed on a CPU server, and then the job could be transferred to a GPU server for the remaining tasks. Alternatively, could the data preparation (CPU) and analysis (GPU) be run at the same time? This would help optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi DeepVariant team,. I'm running DeepVariant via Singularity via Snakemake on a HPC cluster and overall, if I create an interactive session, my entire WES pipeline runs fine until an odd DeepVariant job fails (by that I mean that let's say 30 deepvariant jobs finish ok and the 31st fails). I can then restart the Snakemake run and the same job will run fine, followed by more jobs that will also run fine until another odd jobs fails. This is also particularly true when I use the --cluster command in Snakemake (i.e., send it to a SLURM job scheduler from the master node) - in this event every single job fails. I could of course run all my samples on a single interactive session, keep checking the log file and restart the run every time it fails but I guess that's less than optimal plus this way I can really only run one sample at the time. For the interactive sessions I request 180G and 64cpus (in my case it's: ```srsh --mem=180G --cpus-per-task=64 --partition=long```). . I would request same parameters when using --cluster so:; ```snakemake --cluster ""sbatch --mem=180G cpus-per-task=64"" --jobs 64 --profie profile/ ```(where profile holds singularity args etc.).

Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

Energy Efficiency,"tart to have enough material to get long ONT precise reads (the very last one that is accurate at 99.99%, just like a giant PCR); those are much less likely to mismap, and Clair3 seems extremely powerful and precise to call. Therefore, we could consider the call from long reads as a ""truth set"". . My point is if I give deep variant the ONT ""truth set"" and then the mapping of short illumina reads. Could it be retrained to understand the mapping and calling issues with this kind of genome? I don't have a ""rule"" such as Mendelian violation because my organism is clonal. Therefore, the only possibility of having a ""truth set"" is to trust long reads mapping (Sanger sequencing doesn't work well either; we don't know why). . Is it something doable? I could use other things, such as Python random forests, as suggested by a colleague, but since you have spent a lot of time trying to help me, before, I found it gentlemanly to ask if we can use Deepvariant.; I think the answer is ""Yes, I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage Illumina data. And I'm not sure I will get those datasets resequenced in long reads with enough coverage and N50 (for another reason we don't understand well, DNA extraction is harrowing in rotifers; it often fails or yields highly damaged DNA). Therefore, if I could retrain a model to use the Illumina datasets, that would be great. . My worries are: what does it take in terms of hardware to retrain Deepvariant? I don't have access to a huge GPU. . I found this tutorial: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md . but I am not sure if it is adapted to my case, streamlined, or can be done here, if I understand well this example relies on using Google machines, right?. EDIT: to be perfectly clear it seems to me I need some discussion to understand what you take as a truth set and how you define a bed file with the confidence region.

So, I download the whl from the [GCloud bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant/packages/tensorflow/) and executed `sudo python2.7 pip install <name of .whl file>` through the terminal. It ran, just to tell me “.dist-info directory not found”. I think this might be due to some inconsistency in the packages installed through the build-prereq.sh script, because I can see that all the packages that it installed (e.g. numpy) are for Python 3.5, but the Tensorflow version it's trying to get is for cp27 (Python 2.7). Not sure about where to go from here, would love some assistance :). ### System details; OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS; Python interpreters: Default with Ubuntu (2.7 and 3.5.2); Deep Variant version: Installed it today from the main repo, so probably r0.4.1.

Integrability,"(versus local server + storage) for processing 100s or 1000s of samples (or even more, although I assume that would probably be for more than most individual labs or citizen scientists). I think 24 hour run-time was similar to running GATK on my local computer (with 8 GB of RAM and 4 cores), so I’m not really complaining about the Cloud run-time that I encountered (I am just saying that the estimates provided on the README didn’t match my own experience, even with an almost identical command on Google Cloud). **1b)** I realize that it would take some time (and I’m not sure what would be the benefits versus other projects). However, have you considered allowing users to upload their run-time information (and estimated costs) to a program that might be able to help estimate run-time and cost (to possible help with topic **1a)**, **in the long-term**)?. Since `gcp_deepvariant_runner` avoids the possibility of delays between running steps (and has an exist status depending upon whether variant calling was successful), perhaps some sort of optional reporting to an anonymized database could be provided as a parameter for that?. **2)** While I realize it could be considered a cross-post, I am trying to test running each of the 3 steps run separately on Google Cloud (instead of using `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines`).

I checked the OS level stats, the machines are not swapping. all cpu's are at 100%. Still alot of unused memory and disk. 1) Any idea how I might estimate the expected run time? . 2) Any idea of how I do a better job sizing compute resources?. 3) How do I know if docker is making progress or not?; I did a run a couple of weeks ago. I think it took a total of 66 CPU hrs. It seemed like after all the examples where constructed the docker did not produce log message for a long time. Eventually, the docker completed. The results were really good!. 4) I run on ubuntu and use nohub. I want to run time, my script, report 'data up' on completions. I always put nohub job in the background. It seems like after examples have been constructed I will not see my nohub in the jobs list, however, if I use top I see all my cpu's are running python and are at 100%.

Integrability,"Hi Mark (@depristo),. Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things. In any case, below is the top of the call-graph of percent utilization by method (per version):. #### DV 0.4. ```; # Samples: 186K of event 'cpu-clock'; # Event count (approx.): 46604750000; #; # Children, Self,Command ,Shared Object ,Symbol ; 50.33% , 8.80% ,python ,python2.7 ,[.] PyEval_EvalFrameEx; | ; |--42.49%--PyEval_EvalFrameEx; | | ; | |--30.79%--deepvariant_realigner_python_ssw_clifwrap::pyAligner::wrapAlign_as_align; | | | ; | | --30.34%--StripedSmithWaterman::Aligner::Align; | | | ; | | |--27.87%--ssw_align; | | | | ; | | | |--14.65%--sw_sse2_word; | | | | ; | | | |--8.32%--sw_sse2_byte; | | | | ; | | | |--2.91%--banded_sw; | | | | ; | | | --1.19%--__memcpy_sse2_unaligned; | | | ; | | --1.36%--ssw_init; | | | ; | | --0.89%--qP_byte; | | ; | |--3.30%--deepvariant_realigner_python_debruijn__graph_clifwrap::wrapBuild_as_build; | | | ; | | --3.04%--lea",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/50:684,Bridg,Bridge,684,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/50,1,['Bridg'],['Bridge']

I'm running this on a DNAnexus cloud workstation (`mem1_ssd1_v2_x8`) and using the same version of KMC used in the case study. I am trying to run KMC using the following command:. ```; TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d); time ./kmc -k29 -okff -t8 sra.fq.paths ./sra.fq $TMPDIR; ```. where `sra.fq.paths` is the result of `ls SRR1518158_*.fastq.gz > sra.fq.paths`. The error message is simply `Error: unknown exception`. Have you seen this before? I thought I'd ask here before filing an issue with the KMC repo.

Integrability,"Hi all;; Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility.; - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22; - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process.

If so, is there anything you can suggest to troubleshoot this issue?. **2)** Based upon my Google searches, it seemed like this might have something to do with using TensorFlow.

""For somatic data or any other samples where the genotypes go beyond two copies of DNA, DeepVariant will not work out of the box because the only genotypes supported are hom-alt, het, and hom-ref."". Does the same apply to the RNA-seq model of DeepVariant? If a mutation has a low VAF is it predicted as hom-ref?. Because in RNA-seq, low VAF doesn't necessarily mean the variant is hom-ref in the genome. . ### In RNA-seq:; - **Expression Levels**: RNA-seq measures gene expression, so the VAF of a mutation depends on the expression of the mutant and wild-type alleles. If a gene is highly expressed in some cells and not others, or if only one allele is expressed (allele-specific expression), the VAF may be skewed.; - **Variable Expression**: The VAF in RNA-seq data can be influenced by tissue-specific expression, transcriptional noise, or RNA degradation, making it less consistent compared to DNA-seq.; - **Allelic Imbalance**: In RNA-seq, you might observe allelic imbalance due to factors like imprinting or preferential expression of one allele, further complicating the interpretation of VAF.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864:549,depend,depends,549,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"ch of the 3 steps run separately on Google Cloud (instead of using `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines`). I have some notes on this [Stack Overflow post]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624506/running-docker-on-google-cloud-instance-with-data-in-gcsfuse-mounted-bucket) about the details of my installation and running of Docker on Google Cloud. I suspect there may be some more complications that I need to learn about (in terms of running Docker on Google Cloud, *using data stored in a Google Cloud Bucket*), but the messages that I get are different when using the DeepVariant container versus my own container. So, I thought it might be OK to post a question here. If I try to run [a script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud that is similar to AWS (and based upon the very helpful [DeepVariant Exome Case Study]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md)), I get the following error message:. ```; $ sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists...

This is admittedly for an alternative Exome alignment (to test the code), but I also have an alternative WGS alignment to test. Also, I changed to name on the file on GitHub (but the content is currently the same). Part of that error message is repeated (for each shard), but I only copied one representative example above, for the repeated part. If I try to run the DeepVariant container in interactive mode (to try and understand what is going on), I get the following message (which is a note, without actually going into interactive mode):; ```; docker run -it -v /home/user/cdw-genome:/mnt/cdw-genome gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant; See https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md.; ```; I do have the `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines` example working, so this isn’t absolutely essential for running DeepVariant on Google Cloud. However, if you can help provide me some guidance for running the [linked script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud, I would very much appreciate it.

Integrability,"ting point, I was trying to work with calling variants from the .bam file provided for my WES data. I started running from within a Docker container on my local computer but that was taking a long time (and, ultimately, the _make_examples_ step did not run to completion). I started learning more about the AWS options for analysis, and I was able to run the _make_examples_ much quicker (and successfully) on an AWS m5.xlarge ECS instance (although I am admittedly well over the ~25 minutes and $0.20 time/cost mentioned for Google Cloud, just for the _make_examples_, without considering upload/download, long-term storage, etc.). While I was hoping to eventually compare running things on Google Cloud (and I think my experience so far probably helps me ask better questions), I was wondering if you could help me troubleshoot something that I think is probably close to working:. Essentially, I am currently at the **call_variant** step of DeepVariant, with WES data.

Modifiability," hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. .

I am running DeepTrio for a dataset with known true-positive SNPs and indels. I followed guidelines for DeepTrio but had to change --config DeepVariantWGS to DeepVariant_unfiltered at the glnexus_cli step as a default QUAL threshold of 10 removed a lot of my TP calls.; I have compared distributions of QUAL score in the TP subset and all calls found by DeepTrio. Please see an attached histogram of all DeepTrio calls vs TP calls. Could you please tell me if it is expected that QUAL of TP calls is between 0 and30, while there are calls with QUAL of up to 100? If not, what I could do wrong?; Thank you!.

This is messing with downstream analysis, and overall just looks like poor QC. Additionally, the annotation/filter field is missing. In the gVCFs there was still a ""PASS"" label.

Modifiability,"Hello,. We have found that a known de novo variant was missed when using DeepTrio and GLnexus in our pipeline (WGS, hg38). I know that a similar issue has already been raised and appreciate the interesting discussion on this (i.e. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440), but to recap for others this was the result of two contributing factors:. 1. DeepTrio being less confident in the de novo call for the proband than when DeepVariant is run in singleton mode on the proband. In our case, comparing the output VCFs from these two different runs we saw a reduction in the GQ score assigned to the variant from 56 when using DeepVariant in singleton mode, to only 10 when using DeepTrio.; 2. GLnexus filtering, according to the `DeepVariantWGS` configuration we were using, removing our variant of interest in the case of DeepTrio due to the low likelihood assigned to the call. To partly overcome this we are looking to switch the GLnexus configuration to `DeepVariant_unfiltered` as mentioned in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440. However we would like to further evaluate this change on a known truth set to determine the increase in false-positive calls (similar to [1] with DV-GLN-NOMOD vs DV-GLN-OPT, but for DeepTrio instead... because from what I understand that paper evaluated DeepVariant). I have seen that all three GIAB/NIST benchmark trios have been used as training data for DeepTrio so would like to ask:. 1. Were all chromosomes from these trios used to train the DeepTrio models? I believe the DeepVariant WGS training data excluded chr20-22, and the deeptrio test data uses HG001 Chr20 [2], so I assume chr20-22 were excluded from the Deeptrio models for each of the trios too and would be suitable for testing? Or any alternative suggestions for this?; 2. I understand that the DeepTrio docs aren't officially released yet, but would it be possible please to provide an overview of the workings and differences between the Child and Parent models for DeepT",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475:755,config,configuration,755,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475,2,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"Hello,. We noticed that adjacent variants of the same haplotype (i.e. MNVs) are being called as separate variants in the DeepVariant and DeepTrio outputs with VCF and gVCF files. During downstream processing these MNVs are then treated as two individual SNVs at two different loci, leading to faulty assessments. . For example two variants for a site of interest (reference TCG -> Serine) were separated between two lines in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio output VCF and then categorised as containing a nonsynonymous (T**G**G -> Tryptophan) and synonymous mutation (TC**A** -> Serine). Whereas the correct and desired way to handle this, at least for us but I imagine others too, would seem to be to recognise both mutations on a single line in the VCF as a combined substitution, which could then be identified as resulting in a stopgain (T**GA** -> Nonsense mutation). Are there plans to support these MNV calls in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio outputs? Or alternatively are there any current post-processing approaches that you may be using and can recommend to handle these cases? Can understand these may be challenging to manage in some aspects but could be important to flag given some recent literature around this topic. For reference this was using hg38 with WGS. We initially identified this using the original DeepTrio release (docker image deeptrio:1.0.1rc), but then also using the most recent DeepVariant release (via docker, v1.2). We also tested this to see whether the change to the unfiltered GLnexus config could be contributing to this for processing of DeepTrio gVCFs due to the joint genotyping parameter, but reverting back to the WGS config did not result in a merged MNV in this instance. .

Modifiability,"Hi Mark (@depristo),. Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

Modifiability,"Hi all;; Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility.; - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22; - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process.

Modifiability,"This is from DeepVariant's documentation. ""For somatic data or any other samples where the genotypes go beyond two copies of DNA, DeepVariant will not work out of the box because the only genotypes supported are hom-alt, het, and hom-ref."". Does the same apply to the RNA-seq model of DeepVariant? If a mutation has a low VAF is it predicted as hom-ref?. Because in RNA-seq, low VAF doesn't necessarily mean the variant is hom-ref in the genome. . ### In RNA-seq:; - **Expression Levels**: RNA-seq measures gene expression, so the VAF of a mutation depends on the expression of the mutant and wild-type alleles. If a gene is highly expressed in some cells and not others, or if only one allele is expressed (allele-specific expression), the VAF may be skewed.; - **Variable Expression**: The VAF in RNA-seq data can be influenced by tissue-specific expression, transcriptional noise, or RNA degradation, making it less consistent compared to DNA-seq.; - **Allelic Imbalance**: In RNA-seq, you might observe allelic imbalance due to factors like imprinting or preferential expression of one allele, further complicating the interpretation of VAF.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864:765,Variab,Variable,765,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864,1,['Variab'],['Variable']

Modifiability,"Well, this is not really a problem. It's rather a question. Someone asked about the de novo germline calling last year [#377](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/377). Deeptrio is now available and I want to ask general question in regards with denovo variants in the child. . Background: the biggest issue with calling de novo variants (i.e. variants that are found in proband, generally as heterozygous, negative in parents) is there are ton's of false negative calls (Type II error) (i.e. variants not called in parents but are visually obvious in the alignment). . It seems to me that DeepTrio should address this issue particularly well but I am not sure if that is the motivation behind DeepTrio. How does DeepTrio handle type 2 errors for de novo germline variant calling? can this be added as an enhancement?.

Modifiability,"aining a model (starting from wgs.1.6.1) for use in a fish species. The programs are running well, I have confident regions and truth variants defined, and am currently tuning hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```. The training command looks like this:. ```; LR=0.001; BS=1024. apptainer run \; --nv \; -B $WD:/home \; $DV_PATH \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/train \; --config=/home/dv_config.py:base \; --config.train_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.tune_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/tune_test/tune_test_examples_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.num_epochs=1 \; --config.learning_rate=${LR} \; --config.num_validation_examples=0 \; --config.tune_every_steps=2000 \; --experiment_dir=/home/${OUTDIR} \; --strategy=mirrored \; --config.batch_size=${BS} \; --config.init_checkpoint=""/home/model_wgs_v1.6.1/deepvariant.wgs.ckpt""; ```. During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.3",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1062,config,config,1062,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"e hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```. The training command looks like this:. ```; LR=0.001; BS=1024. apptainer run \; --nv \; -B $WD:/home \; $DV_PATH \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/train \; --config=/home/dv_config.py:base \; --config.train_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.tune_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/tune_test/tune_test_examples_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.num_epochs=1 \; --config.learning_rate=${LR} \; --config.num_validation_examples=0 \; --config.tune_every_steps=2000 \; --experiment_dir=/home/${OUTDIR} \; --strategy=mirrored \; --config.batch_size=${BS} \; --config.init_checkpoint=""/home/model_wgs_v1.6.1/deepvariant.wgs.ckpt""; ```. During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/categorical_accuracy=0.91796875, train/categorical_crossentropy=0.6384725570678711, train/f1_het=0.7428571581840515, train/f1_homalt=0.964401364326477, train/f1_homref=0.902255654335022, train/f1_macro=0.; 8698380589485168, train/f1_micro=0.91796875, train/f1_w",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1364,config,config,1364,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"hi, I am using DV 0.9 to find *de novo* variants in trios and so I am enriching for weird stuff. ; I am sure your team is aware of some/all of these, but I'll document at least 1 case here for the record. Nearly all obvious false positive de novo calls follow the same pattern. Mostly there is a haplotype from mom , and a haplotype from dad that are different. The kid inherits both the variable haplotypes, but the combination of DV and glnexus gentoype such that the variant appears as de novo. But, here is an example where there is just an incorrect call from DV that leads to 3 neighboring spurious de novo calls in the kid (top row):; ![bad-dn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/74561469-d68a6600-4f25-11ea-8c71-105596810ace.png). note that dad in the 3rd row has a single read with a 1-base deletion (dash) followed by an insertion (purple tick). I can't show all of the reads in this image, but I have scrolled through and verified that is the only read. . here is the content of the dad's VCF for that region (the mom's is actually very similar):; ```; chr8	75144980	.

GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL	0/1:49:35:18,17:0.485714:49,0,64; ```; note that that is the single-base del and the insertion that occurs in only 1 read.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. .

However, after playing around inside the image, the line `from tensorflow.python.tools import optimize_for_inference_lib` works fine as I can successfully run; ```; python -c 'from tensorflow.python.tools import optimize_for_inference_lib'; ```.

Modifiability,"ne 209, in _tpu_service; raise RuntimeError('Missing runtime dependency on the Google API client. '; RuntimeError: Missing runtime dependency on the Google API client. Run `pip install cloud-tpu-client` to fix. ```; However, cloud-tpu-client is not actually the problem. The issue is that `google.api_core.client_options` is not found when being imported from `googleapiclient.discovery`. The issue appears to be the [python3.3 _ _ init _ _.py trap](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-init-py-trap) where one python module is blocking another from being found. In the python path there is a `google` module with an `__init__.py` found here, `/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_461ld2s6/runfiles/com_google_protobuf/python/google/__init__.py`, while running. That may be blocking the discovery of `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py`. **Work Around**. I think configuring Bazel to avoid the issue is probably the right way to fix this, but I worked around the issue by patching `googleapiclient.discovery` with the following patch:. ```; 49c49,59; < import google.api_core.client_options; ---; > ; > # Mega hack to avoid init.py trap of google/init.py which is somewhere on the path; > # Make a namespace to hold our module; > import types; > google = types.SimpleNamespace(); > google.api_core = types.SimpleNamespace(); > # Directly import our module into the namespace; > import importlib.util; > spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(""google.api_core.client_options"", ""/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py""); > google.api_core.client_options = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); > spec.loader.exec_module(google.api_core.client_options); ```; This manually imports the required module, which only works because we know the path won't change in our docker image and we know `googleapiclient.discovery` only uses `client_options.py`.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. .

Modifiability,"robably mainly seems to originate in GLnexus merging, where uncalled alleles (e.g., for ""GT:DP:AD:GQ:PL:RNC"" ""./.:5:5,0:0:14,0,104:II"" where I = gVCF input site is non-called) has a non-zero likelihood of being heterozygous according the PL tag, which is later imputed to a ""0/1"" genotype. But this also occurs for samples called as reference (0/0) but with non-zero PL tags for 0/1. For example, the third sample gains a heterozygous genotype at site `Y:6899016` after imputation, and has the gvcf block; ```; Y 6898989 . C <*> 0 . END=6899117 GT:GQ:MIN_DP:MED_DP:PL 0/0:1:0:0:0,3,29; ```. leads to the GLnexus merged GT; ```; Y 6899016 Y_6899016_T_C T C 47 . 0/0:0:0,0:1:0,3,29:..; ```; and then the imputed; ```; Y 6899016 Y_6899016_T_C T C 47 . 0/1:1:0,1,0; ```. ### variant calling with DeepVariant.

Modifiability,"s. The programs are running well, I have confident regions and truth variants defined, and am currently tuning hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```. The training command looks like this:. ```; LR=0.001; BS=1024. apptainer run \; --nv \; -B $WD:/home \; $DV_PATH \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/train \; --config=/home/dv_config.py:base \; --config.train_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.tune_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/tune_test/tune_test_examples_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.num_epochs=1 \; --config.learning_rate=${LR} \; --config.num_validation_examples=0 \; --config.tune_every_steps=2000 \; --experiment_dir=/home/${OUTDIR} \; --strategy=mirrored \; --config.batch_size=${BS} \; --config.init_checkpoint=""/home/model_wgs_v1.6.1/deepvariant.wgs.ckpt""; ```. During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/c",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1098,config,config,1098,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/categorical_accuracy=0.91796875, train/categorical_crossentropy=0.6384725570678711, train/f1_het=0.7428571581840515, train/f1_homalt=0.964401364326477, train/f1_homref=0.902255654335022, train/f1_macro=0.; 86983",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1307,config,config,1307,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"tart to have enough material to get long ONT precise reads (the very last one that is accurate at 99.99%, just like a giant PCR); those are much less likely to mismap, and Clair3 seems extremely powerful and precise to call. Therefore, we could consider the call from long reads as a ""truth set"". . My point is if I give deep variant the ONT ""truth set"" and then the mapping of short illumina reads. Could it be retrained to understand the mapping and calling issues with this kind of genome? I don't have a ""rule"" such as Mendelian violation because my organism is clonal. Therefore, the only possibility of having a ""truth set"" is to trust long reads mapping (Sanger sequencing doesn't work well either; we don't know why). . Is it something doable? I could use other things, such as Python random forests, as suggested by a colleague, but since you have spent a lot of time trying to help me, before, I found it gentlemanly to ask if we can use Deepvariant.; I think the answer is ""Yes, I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage Illumina data. And I'm not sure I will get those datasets resequenced in long reads with enough coverage and N50 (for another reason we don't understand well, DNA extraction is harrowing in rotifers; it often fails or yields highly damaged DNA). Therefore, if I could retrain a model to use the Illumina datasets, that would be great. . My worries are: what does it take in terms of hardware to retrain Deepvariant? I don't have access to a huge GPU. . I found this tutorial: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md . but I am not sure if it is adapted to my case, streamlined, or can be done here, if I understand well this example relies on using Google machines, right?. EDIT: to be perfectly clear it seems to me I need some discussion to understand what you take as a truth set and how you define a bed file with the confidence region.

Performance,"### Issue; When running the build-prereq shell script, I'm getting an error when the Tensorflow install begins. ### Error message; ```; Installing Google Cloud Platform optimized CPU-only TensorFlow wheel; Copying gs://deepvariant/packages/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.4.1.deepvariant_gcp-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl...; - [1 files][ 41.1 MiB/ 41.1 MiB] 1.0 MiB/s ; Operation completed over 1 objects/41.1 MiB. ; tensorflow-1.4.1.deepvariant_gcp-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.; ```. ### Debugging efforts; After browsing around a bit, I discovered that this issue was solved for some through installing the .whl separately. So, I download the whl from the [GCloud bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant/packages/tensorflow/) and executed `sudo python2.7 pip install <name of .whl file>` through the terminal. It ran, just to tell me “.dist-info directory not found”. I think this might be due to some inconsistency in the packages installed through the build-prereq.sh script, because I can see that all the packages that it installed (e.g. numpy) are for Python 3.5, but the Tensorflow version it's trying to get is for cp27 (Python 2.7). Not sure about where to go from here, would love some assistance :). ### System details; OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS; Python interpreters: Default with Ubuntu (2.7 and 3.5.2); Deep Variant version: Installed it today from the main repo, so probably r0.4.1.

Performance,"**Describe the issue:**. Hi, I am wondering if there's been a study on the cost-benefit of running DV in the GPU mode.; Back in the days of PEPPER-DeepVariant-Margin, I remember trying to profile (not as a rigorous study) what benefits there'd be if we were to run the pipeline in the GPU mode.; The conclusion back then from my anecdotal runs is that it's not worth it (we can get the CPU version to <$100/sample with little to minimum effort on optimizing cloud resource allocations, but the GPU version is ~$200/sample with P100). Now given that DV has undergone quite a lot of changes since then, I wonder if the conclusion is changed.; So I did a test run on a PacBio Hifi 30X bam with DV 1.5.0, and collected the GPU resource log (using `gpustat -a -i 1 `, log attached below).; Looking at the log file, it doesn't look like GPU is used much still. So I wonder if you have done any study on this subject and if so, can share some insights. Thank you!. Steve.

Next I download the `.gff3` annotation from and converted it to `.bed` format:. ```; module load nixpkgs/16.09; module load gcc/6.4.0; module load bedops/2.4.35. wget ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/releases/WS274/species/c_elegans/PRJEB28388/c_elegans.PRJEB28388.WS274.annotations.gff3.gz; bgzip -d c_elegans.PRJEB28388.WS274.annotations.gff3.gz; gff2bed < c_elegans.PRJEB28388.WS274.annotations.gff3 > c_elegans.PRJEB28388.WS274.annotations.bed; rm c_elegans.PRJEB28388.WS274.annotations.gff3; ```. The `.vcf.gz` file I download from [CeNDR](https://www.elegansvariation.org/data/release/latest) (comparable to the [DGV database in humans](http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home)) then generate its index file `vcf.gz.tbi`:. ```; wget https://storage.googleapis.com/elegansvariation.org/releases/20180527/variation/WI.20180527.impute.vcf.gz; module load nixpkgs/16.09; module lo",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/292:8143,load,load,8143,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/292,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"Dear Devs, . I am currently training a model (starting from wgs.1.6.1) for use in a fish species. The programs are running well, I have confident regions and truth variants defined, and am currently tuning hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes.

Performance,"Dear developers; . Thanks for the great tool for variant calling. I use deepvariant 1.6.1 for small variant calling from picbio HIFI data (Revio system). For HIFI data, there are two ways to get the input bam for deepvariant. The first, like we do in NGS data analysis, extracting fastq reads from raw HIFI bam and mapping the fastq reads to reference genome, eg. T2TCHM13v2, then get the input bam ( fastq-mapping bam ) ```sample.pbmm2.bam```. ```bash. bam2fastq -o sample.fastq raw.bam; pbmm2 align CHM13.fa sample.fastq sample.pbmm2.bam --preset HIFI. ##; run deepvarint with sample.pbmm2.bam . ```. The second, mapping from bam data with methylation signal to reference genome directly (bam-to-bam mapping) , ```sample.pbmm2.jasmine.bam```. ```bash. jasmine raw.bam raw.jasmine.bam # get 5mC methylation informations; pbmm2 align CHM13.fa raw.jasmine.bam sample.pbmm2.jasmine.bam --preset HIFI # bam-to-bam mapping, keep methylation tags in bam file. ##; run deepvarint with sample.pbmm2.jasmine.bam. ```. The first way bam for small variant calling makes no mistakes. But considering the following methylation analysis also needs to map reads to reference genome, so if it is suitable for using mapped bam with methylation tags to call small variant, we only need to map once, this can save time and computational resources. So my question is, is that OK for us to use bam with methylation tags as the input of deepvariant? Is the performance difference between using ```fastq-mapping bam``` and ```bam-to-bam mapping bam```?. best, .

Performance,"Hello! I've found a performance issue in deepvariant/data_providers.py: `batch()` should be called before `map()`, which could make your program more efficient. Here is [the tensorflow document](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/data_performance?hl=zh_cn#vectorized_mapping) to support it. Detailed description is listed below:. - deepvariant/data_providers.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size=batch_size, drop_remainder=True)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L316) should be called before `dataset.map(map_func=self.parse_tfexample, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L314).; - deepvariant/data_providers.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size=batch_size)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L364) should be called before `dataset.map(map_func=self.parse_tfexample, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L362). Besides, you need to check the function called in `map()`(e.g., `self.parse_tfexample` called in `dataset.map()`) whether to be affected or not to make the changed code work properly. For example, if `self.parse_tfexample` needs data with shape (x, y, z) as its input before fix, it would require data with shape (batch_size, x, y, z). Looking forward to your reply.

Performance,"Hello, ; I used DeepVariant with the mosquito trained model, on 11 samples, then performed joint calling with GLnexus. In the following track, in the first sample it calls 2 SNP G/A and T/C (corresponding to the 2 last blue box) in the D2A1 sample. However, in the D5B3 sample the sites are called as 0/0. There is no ""RefCall"" either so I think it means it did not even generate candidates. ; Point to note: I have no idea if there are, or not, SNPs at those 2 loci. But from the alignment, it is not at clear to me why in one case it thought there were SNPs, and in the other case it thought not. . For the same sites, GATK joint caller decided the site was 0/0 for all samples (again, I don't know which one is the true genotype there). The bam I am showing here are the diagnostic bams emitted by DeepVariant, so my understanding is that I see what it saw. ![igv_snapshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23341393/80101296-7e995c80-8571-11ea-8e3d-37e306442888.png). As you might notice, the coverage depth across my samples is not always identical. So I wonder if it's not simply a question of coverage (though my lowest average coverage value is 30, which is ok I think). . Would you have any clue of what might be happening? . Thank a lot. EDIT: I can get rid of those regions by filtering on QUAL on the GLnexus pVCF, however.

Performance,"Hello, after some quite impressive results applying HiSeq-trained DeepVariant on MGISEQ-2000 data, I've been working on achieving even better performance by retraining DeepVariant specifically for the MGISEQ-2000. To do this I've been broadly following the sketch at https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md. I now have unshuffled tfrecords for six reference samples, and have some questions about next steps. Because it might be relevant to the questions, my data are structured as follows:; * 6 samples (4xHG001/NA12878, 2xHG005/NA24631), each with:; * 25 tfrecord shards (00000-00024) of chr1, for tuning (perhaps over-optimistically) ; * 247 tfrecord shards (00000-00246) of chr2-19, no downsampling, for training; * 247 tfrecord shards (00000-00246) of chr2-19, 50% downsampling, for training; * 17 tfrecord shards (00000-00016) of chr20-22, for validation. My questions are:; 1. Is it necessary to shuffle the training data? I ask as it's proving to be a bit laborious to set up, and so I'm hoping that I can get around it. Given I have so many shards, if I just shuffle the order of the chr2-19 shards when I supply them to the training loop, will this be almost as good as shuffling the whole dataset?; 2. Is it necessary to shuffle the validation data? The tutorial does this, but I'm not sure why.; 3. How can I supply multiple datasets to the training loop (here effectively 12 datasets: 6 samples x 2 downsampling settings)? In the tutorial, `model_train` is supplied a wildcard path of `validation_set.with_label.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz`, which seems like it would only work for a single sample, and I'm not sure how this will work with multiple samples.; 4. Have there been any changes to the code base to better support warmstarting, or is the advice at https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/185 still the best approach to fine-tuning the model?.

Performance,"Hello,. I've been using DeepTrio for de novo variant analysis, and it's been performing excellently. However, I noticed from the logs that DeepTrio uses the CPU to prepare data, which is quite time-consuming. In my case, it took 12 hours for one trio analysis, with an additional 4 hours on the GPU. Given that renting GPU servers( usually with less CPU) is more expensive than CPU servers and access to privately owned GPU servers is limited, it seems inefficient to run lengthy CPU processes on a GPU server. It feels like a bit of a waste, and sometimes I half-jokingly feel there might be someone out there with murderous intent because of it!. Would it be possible in future updates to partition the DeepTrio analysis into separate steps? This way, CPU-intensive tasks could be completed on a CPU server, and then the job could be transferred to a GPU server for the remaining tasks. Alternatively, could the data preparation (CPU) and analysis (GPU) be run at the same time? This would help optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

Performance,"Hi Again,. Thank you again for your help (on previous issues like #166 and #167). I have successfully run one Exome sample and one WGS sample (on AWS and Google Cloud). The WGS sample has ~250 million reads (paired-end, 150 bp x 150 bp), so it has ~25x coverage. Using the code based upon the [Google Cloud DeepVariant example]( https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/tutorials/deepvariant), I could process this 25X WGS samples in almost exactly 24 hours at a cost of approximately $10. On AWS, I probably should have kept more complete notes, but I believe it completed in ~18 hours (with a cost of approximately $15). This includes some cost of storage for the exome sample (and the WGS .fastq.gz files), although read storage would need to be taken into consideration if performing all analysis on the clould. Nevertheless, I previously reported [a much larger number]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-479522653) when I was learning how to use AWS, and these cost figures are now much more similar (as probably should be expected). One reason that I found running each step separately on AWS to be helpful was that I could figure out that I needed to add an extra parameter (`--sample_name VeritasProvided `) for the WGS dataset (for the provided alignment from Veritas) that wasn’t necessary for the Exome dataset (for the provided alignment from Genos). I’ve re-processed each sample locally, so I would also like to compare variant calls from a BWA-MEM alignment. Plus, I would like to make my comparison to AWS as fair as possible. So, here are my thoughts moving forward:. **1a)** I think it is good that you have changed the example WGS run time from [70 minutes]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/9d24133fc83e0423b3d5cf125a710bbefa864bbb/README.md) minutes to [5 hours](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/README.md), but this is still quite different than my own experience (**24 hours**).

Performance,"Hi Mark (@depristo),. Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

A few questions about RNA-seq pre-processing before DeepVariant?. - Do you recommend read trimming before alignment using tools such as fastp?; - I can see that this is the repository for the human reference genome, which DeepVariant recommends. https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/ . But when I perform read alignment using STAR, can I use GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_full_analysis_set.fna instead of GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz? GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_full_analysis_set.fna has the GTF file, which is needed for creating the STAR index.; - Or can I perform the alignment using any GRCh38 reference genome? Does it have to be the same one, GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set, used in the RNA-seq tutorial of DeepVariant.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/791:384,perform,perform,384,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/791,2,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"I ran training for a number of epochs and obtained a model checkpoint (lets call it `checkpoint-first`) with accuracy > 0.99 (F1/All). Then I launched training again with `--start_from_checkpoint=checkpoint-first`. I expected `model-ckpt-0` for the second training run to show the same high accuracy as `checkpoint-first`. But it shows very low accuracy instead (F1/All is 0.85 or so). However the next checkpoint after `model-ckpt-0` (lets call it `model-ckpt-N`) shows high accuracy.

Performance,"I'm trying to build a scatter gather implementation of make_calls -> call_variants -> post_processing, without using GNU parallel, and since multiple shards of call_variants, even with num_readers set to 1, increases the system load well beyond the number of cores, I'd like to try to limit this to a 1:1 ratio where one shard produces a system load of 1. Is this possible?. This is essentially what my pipeline looks like today: https://github.com/oskarvid/wdl_deepvariant/blob/master/deepvar-simple-SG.wdl; I say essentially because I've made insignificant changes, like added --num_readers for example. . One way would be to try to combine all tfrecord files into one, because wdl cannot use your method of using all output files from make_calls as input files for call_variants, inputFile@#shards.gz doesn't compute for wdl, and using wdl's normal way of handling multiple input files, i.e ""--examples ${sep="" --examples "" InputFile}"" doesn't work either since call_variants only takes the last ""--examples"" as input when there are many ""--examples"" in the command. Regarding combining the tfrecord files before they're used as input for call_variants, I'm not familiar enough with tensorflow to know if it's at all possible, and a quick google search didn't return anything fruitful. Is it possible to combine many tfrecord files into one?. Is it easier to try to limit the number of threads per process instead of trying to combine the tfrecord files?
