Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams,; furthest-site Voronoi diagrams, and halfspace intersections about a point.; It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, or higher. It implements the Quickhull algorithm; for computing convex hulls. Qhull handles round-off errors from floating; point arithmetic. It can approximate a convex hull. The program includes options for hull volume, facet area, partial hulls,; input transformations, randomization, tracing, multiple output formats, and; execution statistics. The program can be called from within your application.; You can view the results in 2-d, 3-d and 4-d with Geomview.

Abstract:. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains; the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that; combines the two-dimensional Quickhull Algorithm with the general dimension; Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental; algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical; evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains non-extreme; points, and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets; are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating point; arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe; a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or; four dimensions.

Qhull is a general dimension convex hull program that reads a set ; of points from stdin, and outputs the smallest convex set that contains ; the points to stdout. It also generates Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi ; diagrams, furthest-site Voronoi diagrams, and halfspace intersections; about a point. Rbox is a useful tool in generating input for Qhull; it generates ; hypercubes, diamonds, cones, circles, simplices, spirals, ; lattices, and random points.; ; Qhull produces graphical output for Geomview. This helps with; understanding the output. <http://www.geomview.org>. Environment requirements. Qhull and rbox should run on all 32-bit and 64-bit computers. Use; an ANSI C or C++ compiler to compile the program. The software is ; self-contained. It comes with examples and test scripts.; ; Qhull's C++ interface uses the STL. The C++ test program uses QTestLib ; from the Qt Framework. Qhull's C++ interface may change without ; notice.

Install [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/); 2. Create a new project (`File -> Project...-> Create project`) and add your raw images; 3. Annotate nuclei/objects; 4. Run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stardist/stardist/main/extras/qupath_export_annotations.groovy) to export the annotations (save the script and drag it on QuPath. Then execute it with `Run for project`). The script will create a `ground_truth` folder within your QuPath project that includes both the `images` and `masks` subfolder that then can directly be used with *StarDist*. To see how this could be done, have a look at the following [example QuPath project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stardist/stardist/main/extras/qupath_example_project.zip) (data courtesy of Romain Guiet, EPFL). ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/qupath.png). ### Multi-class Prediction.

Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). Please see this [detailed guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#macos) for more information on both strategies (although written for [scikit-image](https://scikit-learn.org), it also applies here).

After that, you can build the package like this (adjust compiler names/paths as necessary):. CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 pip install stardist. If you use `conda` on macOS and after `import stardist` see errors similar to `Symbol not found: _GOMP_loop_nonmonotonic_dynamic_next`, please see [this issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues/19#issuecomment-535610758) for a temporary workaround. If you encounter an `ImportError: dlopen(...): symbol not found in flat namespace ...` error on `import stardist`, you may try to install it like so:. ```; brew install libomp. export HOMEBREW_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew #set to your homebrew prefix; export CPPFLAGS=""$CPPFLAGS -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp""; export CFLAGS=""$CFLAGS -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include""; export CXXFLAGS=""$CXXFLAGS -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include""; export LDFLAGS=""$LDFLAGS -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -lomp"". pip install stardist --no-binary :all:; ```. ##### Apple Silicon.

Abstract:. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains; the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that; combines the two-dimensional Quickhull Algorithm with the general dimension; Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental; algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical; evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains non-extreme; points, and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets; are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating point; arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe; a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or; four dimensions. The output is a set of ""thick"" facets that contain all; possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five; or more dimensions.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/stardist/lib/external/qhull_src/Announce.txt:1838,error,errors,1838,stardist/lib/external/qhull_src/Announce.txt,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/stardist/lib/external/qhull_src/Announce.txt,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"t if someone already created a similar issue. ### Installation. If `pip install stardist` fails, it could be because there are no compatible wheels (`.whl`) for your platform ([see list](https://pypi.org/project/stardist/#files)). In this case, `pip` tries to compile a C++ extension that our Python package relies on (see below). While this often works on Linux out of the box, it will likely fail on Windows and macOS without installing a suitable compiler. (Note that you can enforce compilation by installing via `pip install stardist --no-binary :stardist:`.). Installation without using wheels requires Python 3.6 (or newer) and a working C++ compiler. We have only tested [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (macOS, Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (macOS), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Windows 10). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues) if you have problems that are not resolved by the information below. If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs. This can be important to prevent slow model training. #### macOS; The default C/C++ compiler Clang that comes with the macOS command line tools (installed via `xcode-select --install`) does not support OpenMP out of the box, but it can be added. Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org).

StarDist also supports multi-class prediction, i.e. each found object instance can additionally be classified into a fixed number of discrete object classes (e.g. cell types):. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/stardist_multiclass.png). Please see the [multi-class example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb) if you're interested in this. ## Instance segmentation metrics. StarDist contains the `stardist.matching` submodule that provides functions to compute common instance segmentation metrics between ground-truth label masks and predictions (not necessarily from StarDist). Currently available metrics are. * `tp`, `fp`, `fn`; * `precision`, `recall`, `accuracy`, `f1`; * `panoptic_quality`; * `mean_true_score`, `mean_matched_score`. which are computed by matching ground-truth/prediction objects if their IoU exceeds a threshold (by default 50%). See the documentation of `stardist.matching.matching` for a detailed explanation. Here is an example how to use it:. ```python. # create some example ground-truth and dummy prediction data; from stardist.data import test_image_nuclei_2d; from scipy.ndimage import rotate; _, y_true = test_image_nuclei_2d(return_mask=True); y_pred = rotate(y_true, 2, order=0, reshape=False). # compute metrics between ground-truth and prediction; from stardist.matching import matching. metrics = matching(y_true, y_pred). print(metrics); ```; ```; Matching(criterion='iou', thresh=0.5, fp=88, tp=37, fn=88, precision=0.296, ; recall=0.296, accuracy=0.17",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:11189,mask,masks,11189,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,1,['mask'],['masks']

This Docker image is extended from `tensorflow/tensorflow:2.11.0-gpu-jupyter`, which is based on `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` with `CUDA 11.2` and `Python 3.8.10`. ### Prerequisites. - [Docker 19.03](https://docs.docker.com/install/); - NVIDIA Driver; - [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). For further information, see the [TensorFlow Docker documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker). ### Building image. # assuming that you are in the docker/ directory; docker build -t stardist --build-arg NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION=470 . Please change the `NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION` depending on your environment. Try `nvidia-smi | grep ""Driver Version""` or `cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version` to find your driver version. This argument is used to install an appropriate package for running OpenCL. ### Usage example. # assuming that you are in the project root directory; docker run --rm -it --gpus 1 -v $(pwd):/tf/stardist -p 8888:8888 stardist. This command will launch a jupyter notebook as root, binding the project root directory to `/tf/stardist`. ### Notes. - Please see the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [its parent image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/tensorflow/tensorflow/2.11.0-gpu-jupyter/images/sha256-fc519621eb9a54591721e9019f1606688c9abb329b16b00cc7107c23f14a6f24) for details.; - Please follow the instructions for the usage of [Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).; - Previous versions of Docker + nvidia-docker2 might work as well but have not been tested.",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/docker/README.md:151,install,install,151,docker/README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/docker/README.md,4,['install'],['install']

If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs. This can be important to prevent slow model training. #### macOS; The default C/C++ compiler Clang that comes with the macOS command line tools (installed via `xcode-select --install`) does not support OpenMP out of the box, but it can be added. Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). Please see this [detailed guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#macos) for more information on both strategies (although written for [scikit-image](https://scikit-learn.org), it also applies here). A third alternative (and what we did until StarDist 0.8.1) is to install the OpenMP-enabled GCC compiler via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install gcc` (e.g. installing `gcc-12`/`g++-12` or newer). After that, you can build the package like this (adjust compiler names/paths as necessary):. CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 pip install stardist. If you use `conda` on macOS and after `import stardist` see errors similar to `Symbol not found: _GOMP_loop_nonmonotonic_dynamic_next`, please see [this issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues/19#issuecomment-535610758) for a temporary workaround. If you encounter an `ImportError: dlopen(...): symbol not found in flat namespace ...` error on `import stardist`, you may try to install it like so:. ```; brew install libomp. export HOMEBREW_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew #set to your homebrew prefix; export CPPFLAGS=""$CPPFLAGS -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp""; export CFLAGS=""$CFLAGS -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include""; export CXXFLAGS=""$CXXFLAGS -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include""; export LDFLAGS=""$LDFLAGS -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -lomp"". pip install stardist --no-binary :",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:15499,install,install,15499,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,1,['install'],['install']

When opening a new topic, please provide a clear and concise description to understand and ideally reproduce the issue you're having (e.g. including a code snippet, Python script, or Jupyter notebook).; 3. If you have a technical question related to the source code or believe to have found a bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues), but please check first if someone already created a similar issue. ### Installation. If `pip install stardist` fails, it could be because there are no compatible wheels (`.whl`) for your platform ([see list](https://pypi.org/project/stardist/#files)). In this case, `pip` tries to compile a C++ extension that our Python package relies on (see below). While this often works on Linux out of the box, it will likely fail on Windows and macOS without installing a suitable compiler. (Note that you can enforce compilation by installing via `pip install stardist --no-binary :stardist:`.). Installation without using wheels requires Python 3.6 (or newer) and a working C++ compiler. We have only tested [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (macOS, Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (macOS), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Windows 10). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues) if you have problems that are not resolved by the information below. If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs.

If not, feel free to create a new topic there and make sure to use the tag `stardist` (we are monitoring all questions with this tag). When opening a new topic, please provide a clear and concise description to understand and ideally reproduce the issue you're having (e.g. including a code snippet, Python script, or Jupyter notebook).; 3. If you have a technical question related to the source code or believe to have found a bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues), but please check first if someone already created a similar issue. ### Installation. If `pip install stardist` fails, it could be because there are no compatible wheels (`.whl`) for your platform ([see list](https://pypi.org/project/stardist/#files)). In this case, `pip` tries to compile a C++ extension that our Python package relies on (see below). While this often works on Linux out of the box, it will likely fail on Windows and macOS without installing a suitable compiler. (Note that you can enforce compilation by installing via `pip install stardist --no-binary :stardist:`.). Installation without using wheels requires Python 3.6 (or newer) and a working C++ compiler. We have only tested [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (macOS, Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (macOS), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Windows 10). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues) if you have problems that are not resolved by the information below.

We currently provide a ImageJ/Fiji plugin that can be used to run pretrained StarDist models on 2D or 2D+time images. Installation and usage instructions can be found at the [plugin page](https://imagej.net/StarDist). ### Napari. We made a plugin for the Python-based multi-dimensional image viewer [napari](https://napari.org). It directly uses the StarDist Python package and works for 2D and 3D images. Please see the [code repository](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-napari) for further details. ### QuPath. Inspired by the Fiji plugin, [Pete Bankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead) made a custom implementation of StarDist 2D for [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io) to use pretrained models. Please see [this page](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/advanced/stardist.html) for documentation and installation instructions. ### Icy. Based on the Fiji plugin, [Deborah Schmidt](https://github.com/frauzufall) made a StarDist 2D plugin for [Icy](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-icy) to use pretrained models. Please see the [code repository](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-icy) for further details. ### KNIME. [Stefan Helfrich](https://github.com/stelfrich) has modified the Fiji plugin to be compatible with [KNIME](https://www.knime.com).

If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs. This can be important to prevent slow model training. #### macOS; The default C/C++ compiler Clang that comes with the macOS command line tools (installed via `xcode-select --install`) does not support OpenMP out of the box, but it can be added. Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). Please see this [detailed guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#macos) for more information on both strategies (although written for [scikit-image](https://scikit-learn.org), it also applies here). A third alternative (and what we did until StarDist 0.8.1) is to install the OpenMP-enabled GCC compiler via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install gcc` (e.g. installing `gcc-12`/`g++-12` or newer).

The new, reentrant 'C' code (src/libqhull_r), passes a pointer to qhT ; to most Qhull routines. This allows multiple instances of Qhull to run ; at the same time. It simplifies the C++ interface. The non-reentrant 'C' code (src/libqhull) looks unusual. It refers to ; Qhull's global data structure, qhT, through a 'qh' macro (e.g., 'qh ferr'). ; This allows the same code to use static memory or heap memory. ; If qh_QHpointer is defined, qh_qh is a pointer to an allocated qhT; ; otherwise qh_qh is a global static data structure of type qhT. ------------------; Compiling Qhull with Microsoft Visual C++.

We made a plugin for the Python-based multi-dimensional image viewer [napari](https://napari.org). It directly uses the StarDist Python package and works for 2D and 3D images. Please see the [code repository](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-napari) for further details. ### QuPath. Inspired by the Fiji plugin, [Pete Bankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead) made a custom implementation of StarDist 2D for [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io) to use pretrained models. Please see [this page](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/advanced/stardist.html) for documentation and installation instructions. ### Icy. Based on the Fiji plugin, [Deborah Schmidt](https://github.com/frauzufall) made a StarDist 2D plugin for [Icy](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-icy) to use pretrained models. Please see the [code repository](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-icy) for further details. ### KNIME.

The final result is obtained via non-maximum suppression (NMS) of these candidates. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/overview_2d.png). The approach for 3D volumes is similar to the one described for 2D, using pairs of input and fully annotated label volumes as training data. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/overview_3d.png). ## Webinar/Tutorial.

If you only want to use a StarDist plugin for a GUI-based software, please read [this](#plugins-for-other-software). 1. Please first [install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install); (either TensorFlow 1 or 2) by following the official instructions.; For [GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu), it is very; important to install the specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN that are; compatible with the respective version of TensorFlow. (If you need help and can use `conda`, take a look at [this](https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep/tree/main/extras#conda-environment).). 2. *StarDist* can then be installed with `pip`:. - If you installed TensorFlow 2 (version *2.x.x*):. pip install stardist. - If you installed TensorFlow 1 (version *1.x.x*):. pip install ""stardist[tf1]"". #### Notes. - Depending on your Python installation, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.; - You can find out which version of TensorFlow is installed via `pip show tensorflow`.; - We provide pre-compiled binaries (""wheels"") that should work for most Linux",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:3929,plugin,plugin,3929,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,2,['plugin'],"['plugin', 'plugins-for-other-software']"

Modifiability,"rediction + input overlay""); ```. ![](images/pretrained_example.png). ### Annotating Images. To train a *StarDist* model you will need some ground-truth annotations: for every raw training image there has to be a corresponding label image where all pixels of a cell region are labeled with a distinct integer (and background pixels are labeled with 0).; To create such annotations in 2D, there are several options, among them being [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/), [Labkit](https://imagej.net/Labkit), or [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io). In 3D, there are fewer options: [Labkit](https://github.com/maarzt/imglib2-labkit) and [Paintera](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/paintera) (the latter being very sophisticated but having a steeper learning curve). Although each of these provide decent annotation tools, we currently recommend using Labkit (for 2D or 3D images) or QuPath (for 2D):. #### Annotating with LabKit (2D or 3D). 1. Install [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) and the [Labkit](https://imagej.net/Labkit) plugin; 2. Open the (2D or 3D) image and start Labkit via `Plugins > Labkit > Open Current Image With Labkit`; 3. Successively add a new label and annotate a single cell instance with the brush tool until *all* cells are labeled. ; (Always disable `allow overlapping labels` or – in older versions of LabKit – enable the `override` option.) ; 4. Export the label image via `Labeling > Save Labeling ...` with `Files of Type > TIF Image` making sure that the file name ends with `.tif` or `.tiff`. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/labkit_2d_labkit.png). Additional tips:. * The Labkit viewer uses [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer) and its keybindings (e.g. <kbd>s</kbd> for contrast options, <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>mouse-wheel</kbd> for zoom-in/out etc.); * For 3D images (XYZ) it is best to first convert it to a (XYT) timeseries (via `Re-Order Hyperstack` and swapping `z` and `t`) and then use <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> in Labkit to walk ",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:8635,plugin,plugin,8635,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,1,['plugin'],['plugin']

Please [cite the paper(s)](#how-to-cite) if you are using this code in your research. ## Overview. The following figure illustrates the general approach for 2D images. The training data consists of corresponding pairs of input (i.e. raw) images and fully annotated label images (i.e. every pixel is labeled with a unique object id or 0 for background).; A model is trained to densely predict the distances (r) to the object boundary along a fixed set of rays and object probabilities (d), which together produce an overcomplete set of candidate polygons for a given input image. The final result is obtained via non-maximum suppression (NMS) of these candidates. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/overview_2d.png). The approach for 3D volumes is similar to the one described for 2D, using pairs of input and fully annotated label volumes as training data. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/overview_3d.png). ## Webinar/Tutorial.

Then execute it with `Run for project`). The script will create a `ground_truth` folder within your QuPath project that includes both the `images` and `masks` subfolder that then can directly be used with *StarDist*.

To train a *StarDist* model you will need some ground-truth annotations: for every raw training image there has to be a corresponding label image where all pixels of a cell region are labeled with a distinct integer (and background pixels are labeled with 0).; To create such annotations in 2D, there are several options, among them being [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/), [Labkit](https://imagej.net/Labkit), or [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io). In 3D, there are fewer options: [Labkit](https://github.com/maarzt/imglib2-labkit) and [Paintera](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/paintera) (the latter being very sophisticated but having a steeper learning curve). Although each of these provide decent annotation tools, we currently recommend using Labkit (for 2D or 3D images) or QuPath (for 2D):. #### Annotating with LabKit (2D or 3D). 1.

Here is an example how to use it:. ```python. # create some example ground-truth and dummy prediction data; from stardist.data import test_image_nuclei_2d; from scipy.ndimage import rotate; _, y_true = test_image_nuclei_2d(return_mask=True); y_pred = rotate(y_true, 2, order=0, reshape=False). # compute metrics between ground-truth and prediction; from stardist.matching import matching. metrics = matching(y_true, y_pred). print(metrics); ```; ```; Matching(criterion='iou', thresh=0.5, fp=88, tp=37, fn=88, precision=0.296, ; recall=0.296, accuracy=0.17",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:11199,predict,predictions,11199,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,1,['predict'],['predictions']
Safety,"t, EPFL). ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/qupath.png). ### Multi-class Prediction. StarDist also supports multi-class prediction, i.e. each found object instance can additionally be classified into a fixed number of discrete object classes (e.g. cell types):. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/stardist_multiclass.png). Please see the [multi-class example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb) if you're interested in this. ## Instance segmentation metrics. StarDist contains the `stardist.matching` submodule that provides functions to compute common instance segmentation metrics between ground-truth label masks and predictions (not necessarily from StarDist). Currently available metrics are. * `tp`, `fp`, `fn`; * `precision`, `recall`, `accuracy`, `f1`; * `panoptic_quality`; * `mean_true_score`, `mean_matched_score`. which are computed by matching ground-truth/prediction objects if their IoU exceeds a threshold (by default 50%). See the documentation of `stardist.matching.matching` for a detailed explanation. Here is an example how to use it:. ```python. # create some example ground-truth and dummy prediction data; from stardist.data import test_image_nuclei_2d; from scipy.ndimage import rotate; _, y_true = test_image_nuclei_2d(return_mask=True); y_pred = rotate(y_true, 2, order=0, reshape=False). # compute metrics between ground-truth and prediction; from stardist.matching import matching. metrics = matching(y_true, y_pred). print(metrics); ```; ```; Matching(criterion='iou', thresh=0.5, fp=88, tp=37, fn=88, precision=0.296, ; recall=0.296, accuracy=0.1737, f1=0.296, n_true=125, n_pred=125, ; mean_true_score=0.19490, mean_matched_score=0.65847, panoptic_quality=0.19490); ```.

Version 1 (simplicial only):; <http://www.qhull.org/download/qhull-1.0.tar.gz>; ; Purpose. Qhull is a general dimension convex hull program that reads a set ; of points from stdin, and outputs the smallest convex set that contains ; the points to stdout. It also generates Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi ; diagrams, furthest-site Voronoi diagrams, and halfspace intersections; about a point. Rbox is a useful tool in generating input for Qhull; it generates ; hypercubes, diamonds, cones, circles, simplices, spirals, ; lattices, and random points.; ; Qhull produces graphical output for Geomview. This helps with; understanding the output. <http://www.geomview.org>. Environment requirements. Qhull and rbox should run on all 32-bit and 64-bit computers. Use; an ANSI C or C++ compiler to compile the program. The software is ; self-contained. It comes with examples and test scripts.; ; Qhull's C++ interface uses the STL. The C++ test program uses QTestLib ; from the Qt Framework. Qhull's C++ interface may change without ; notice. Eventually, it will move into the qhull shared library.; ; Qhull is copyrighted software. Please read COPYING.txt and REGISTER.txt; before using or distributing Qhull. To cite Qhull, please use.

If you have a technical question related to the source code or believe to have found a bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues), but please check first if someone already created a similar issue. ### Installation. If `pip install stardist` fails, it could be because there are no compatible wheels (`.whl`) for your platform ([see list](https://pypi.org/project/stardist/#files)). In this case, `pip` tries to compile a C++ extension that our Python package relies on (see below). While this often works on Linux out of the box, it will likely fail on Windows and macOS without installing a suitable compiler. (Note that you can enforce compilation by installing via `pip install stardist --no-binary :stardist:`.). Installation without using wheels requires Python 3.6 (or newer) and a working C++ compiler. We have only tested [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (macOS, Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (macOS), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Windows 10). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues) if you have problems that are not resolved by the information below. If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs. This can be important to prevent slow model training. #### macOS; The default C/C++ compiler Clang that comes with the macOS command line tools (installed via `xcode-select --install`) does not support OpenMP out of the box, but it can be added. Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org).

To train a *StarDist* model you will need some ground-truth annotations: for every raw training image there has to be a corresponding label image where all pixels of a cell region are labeled with a distinct integer (and background pixels are labeled with 0).; To create such annotations in 2D, there are several options, among them being [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/), [Labkit](https://imagej.net/Labkit), or [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io). In 3D, there are fewer options: [Labkit](https://github.com/maarzt/imglib2-labkit) and [Paintera](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/paintera) (the latter being very sophisticated but having a steeper learning curve). Although each of these provide decent annotation tools, we currently recommend using Labkit (for 2D or 3D images) or QuPath (for 2D):. #### Annotating with LabKit (2D or 3D). 1. Install [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) and the [Labkit](https://imagej.net/Labkit) plugin; 2. Open the (2D or 3D) image and start Labkit via `Plugins > Labkit > Open Current Image With Labkit`; 3. Successively add a new label and annotate a single cell instance with the brush tool until *all* cells are labeled. ; (Always disable `allow overlapping labels` or – in older versions of LabKit – enable the `override` option.) ; 4. Export the label image via `Labeling > Save Labeling ...` with `Files of Type > TIF Image` making sure that the file name ends with `.tif` or `.tiff`. ![](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/raw/main/images/labkit_2d_labkit.png). Additional tips:. * The Labkit viewer uses [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer) and its keybindings (e.g.",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:8364,learn,learning,8364,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,1,['learn'],['learning']

Usability,"ing via `pip install stardist --no-binary :stardist:`.). Installation without using wheels requires Python 3.6 (or newer) and a working C++ compiler. We have only tested [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (macOS, Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (macOS), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Windows 10). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues) if you have problems that are not resolved by the information below. If available, the C++ code will make use of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to exploit multiple CPU cores for substantially reduced runtime on modern CPUs. This can be important to prevent slow model training. #### macOS; The default C/C++ compiler Clang that comes with the macOS command line tools (installed via `xcode-select --install`) does not support OpenMP out of the box, but it can be added. Alternatively, a suitable compiler can be installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). Please see this [detailed guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#macos) for more information on both strategies (although written for [scikit-image](https://scikit-learn.org), it also applies here). A third alternative (and what we did until StarDist 0.8.1) is to install the OpenMP-enabled GCC compiler via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install gcc` (e.g. installing `gcc-12`/`g++-12` or newer). After that, you can build the package like this (adjust compiler names/paths as necessary):. CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 pip install stardist. If you use `conda` on macOS and after `import stardist` see errors similar to `Symbol not found: _GOMP_loop_nonmonotonic_dynamic_next`, please see [this issue](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/issues/19#issuecomment-535610758) for a temporary workaround. If you encounter an `ImportError: dlopen(...): symbol not found in flat namespace ...` error on `import stardist`, you may try to install it like so:. ```; brew install libomp. export HOME",MatchSource.DOCS,stardist,stardist,0.9.1,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md:15140,guid,guide,15140,README.md,,https://github.com/stardist/stardist/tree/0.9.1/README.md,2,"['guid', 'learn']","['guide', 'learn']"

See html/qh-code.htm#library for calling Qhull from C programs. See html/qh-code.htm#reentrant for converting from Qhull-2012. Warning: You will need to understand Qhull's data structures and read the ; code. Most users will find it easier to call Qhull as an external command. The new, reentrant 'C' code (src/libqhull_r), passes a pointer to qhT ; to most Qhull routines. This allows multiple instances of Qhull to run ; at the same time. It simplifies the C++ interface. The non-reentrant 'C' code (src/libqhull) looks unusual. It refers to ; Qhull's global data structure, qhT, through a 'qh' macro (e.g., 'qh ferr'). ; This allows the same code to use static memory or heap memory. ; If qh_QHpointer is defined, qh_qh is a pointer to an allocated qhT; ; otherwise qh_qh is a global static data structure of type qhT. ------------------; Compiling Qhull with Microsoft Visual C++.
