Finally, I am more worried about the vectorization, is that going to be optional or easy to disable?

So instead it tries to install from pypi.; The 3.1.1.1 is the latest version of OpenBabel on pypi (https://pypi.org/project/openbabel/3.1.1.1/) that was created due to some packaging issue. If I recall correctly it's the same as 3.1.1 on most platforms.; I don't think the ""invalid version error"" is the real error, the problem is that it doesn't find the include files.; I haven't used packaged installs in a while but you might try to install libopenbabel-dev instead of python3-openbabel. I cannot remember if the dev files are included in the ""regular openbabel install"" but it's worth a try.; Otherwise we need to check if the folder `/usr/local/include/openbabel3` contains the missing files.

Deployability,"I've looked through the code carefully, and both of these will need to fall under new features. This means, unfortunately, it won't be fixed in time for the 2.3.0 release next week. 1) There currently isn't a special case to enforce SP geometry or stereochemistry in the builder. So as far as I can see, it defaults to octahedral. 2) There isn't support for TB stereochemistry, although as you see, the builder does have support for TB geometries. I suspect both of these bugs will be fixed for v2.3.1.

Deployability,"I've updated the patch, and updated the title of this patch to better reflect what it does. The problem was that OBConversion::Write() always set SetOneObjectOnly() so there was no way it could be used to generate CML output. The CML writer looked at Index and IsLast to see if it was a single-molecule or multi-molecule output. If the former, it wrote <molecule> element. If the latter it wrote a <cml> element containing 2 or more <molecule> elements. Another problem was that it needs to Index++ before calling WriteMolecule(), as that's the only way for the initialization code check (Index==1) to be correct *and* for GetOutputIndex() to reflect the number of molecules written. That in turn means that WriteFile() and WriteString() need to set Index=0 before calling Write(). In addition, I updated WriteString() so it saves/restores more state, and I added the new testobconversion_writers.py test program to the list of test cases for ""make test"". Finally, I include a 2-molecule CML test case, to ensure that it is possible to use the updated Writer API implementation to create the correct output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455598175:5,update,updated,5,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455598175,6,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'updated']"

Deployability,"In absence of working knowledge of C++, I lack insight how Openbabel's C++ code is organized, interacting, and eventually providing results. Your log shared by 2029-02-29 might indicate ""something is broken"" in the setup of Open Babel accessible to you, because issuing the same command as you yields in my instance (OpenBabel 3.1.1. as provided by Debian) only the following:. ```shell; $ obabel 3lcs.pdb -O 3lcs_prot.pdb -p; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in PerceiveBondOrders; Failed to kekulize aromatic bonds in OBMol::PerceiveBondOrders (title is 3lcs.pdb). 1 molecule converted; ```. Speculation: the PLIB tool's file `requirements.txt` lists Open Babel (line 4, `openbabel~=3.0.0`), which might interfere here. It might be a library missing, or a conflict of ""which one to use"" e.g., if you have a system wide installation of OpenBabel, then partially overwritten by PLIB. My recommendation consists of. - to remove the current (local?) installation of Open Babel.; - if you reinstall Open Babel for general use on the computer (e.g., because of obgui), use the most recent version ([original source](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases)); - if you want to want to use Open Babel inside a Python project, use a virtual environment; isolated from the rest of Python libraries you have, an error in dependencies of the libraries were constrained to this compartment; - edit this (or any other) `requirements.txt` file. The current fetch of openbabel's Python bindings via pypi is known to be problematic; perhaps because it lists version 3.1.1.1 (four levels) on its [PyPi entry](https://pypi.org/project/openbabel/) instead of typical three (e.g., 3.1.1). Anyway, substitute the line of `openbabel` by `openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16` (as an example of application, see [here](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/fragments/blob/main/scripts/requirements.txt)) before running the usual `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to amend the local Python setup.

Deployability,It is the maintainers of the package in Debian that have opted for `/usr/include/openbabel3`.

Deployability,"It is true, CCDC's Mercury is one of the corner stones of their CSD database product.

The arrangement of 2 x 2 x 2 unit cells next to each other and their subsequent export this as .cif and .xyz was achieved with this free Mercury version, too.

The older the Mercury, the less of libraries are installed (regardless if eventually be useable by a license, or not) and less resource hungry because they started to pack it with PovRay for image rendering, a minimal Python + some larger Python libraries for visualization one would use when accessing the CSD database via the Python API.

Deployability,"It's a subtle point, but I disagree that we are interpreting the SMILES differently - we both read the same molecule. The real culprit here is any operation that's sensitive to explicit vs. implicit Hs, such as the use of this Dn notation.

Deployability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful. The access from the CLI however is *more suitable* (or, the only reasonable way) to interact with openbabel to *pipe* and *tee* input, output, error streams with a script, or programs (grep, sed, awk; an other instance of openbabel; something written by you, etc.). In the case of a Debian based Linux operating system, for instance, the installation is modular: bindings to python, or the installation of the gui are optional (require an additional explicit opt-in) to `openbabel` and `libopenbabel7` for the executable to the CLI:. ![synaptic](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/c40aa8e1-4551-4e89-8f44-d6fc35df2400).

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1444119; Originator: NO. This is a bug in the canonicalizer. The canonicalizer figures out the symmetry groups of the atoms without taking chirality into account, so any time there are two atoms that are identical except for their chirality, you'll get two possible ""canonical"" SMILES. Another instance of this is documented in the code, where a cis/trans configuration is incorrectly analyzed because, without taking chirality into account, it appears to be symmetrical and hence not cis or trans. In this case there is an axis of symmetry through a ring, and the only difference in the two halves of the ring are the two chiral centers themselves. So when the canonical-SMILES tree-generator reaches the ring, it has a choice between going left or right, and both paths appear identical, so it can generate two different canonical SMILES. The canonicalizer needs to add chirality to the atom-invarients *before* it starts analyzing chirality. However, even this is tricky, because sometimes a center can be chiral or achiral depending on the chirality of *other* atoms, leading to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem. Maybe a two-pass symmetry analysis is needed: First without chirality, then add in the chirality as new atom-invarients when a tie between two chiral atoms is discovered, and re-do the symmetry analysis.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1871725; Originator: NO. SMI format does not have it even in 2.2 release.; CAN format has it but the normalization procedure often makes it difficult to compare the resulting SMILES with the structure one wanted to generate - e.g. the directions ""in"" and ""out"" of the screen are often reversed etc. For complicated structures it is sometimes very non-trivial to check if the stereochemistry; has been correctly assigned.; The best option (for me) would be to have regular SMILES (not normalized to canonical format) reflect the stereoinformation conveyed by the OB_HASH_BOND and OB_WEDGE_BOND flags.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420. For obvious reasons, I don't like that hack. IMHO, the real reason is that there isn't a ""default"" SMARTS pattern to ; fall back on. So I've added a variety of ""default"" patterns for carbon, ; nitrogen, etc. -- molecules matching more specific SMARTS patterns ; would use those since they come later in the file. Here's my patch, which seems to mark the imidazole ring correctly (it'll ; be in CVS in a few minutes):; In aromatic.txt:; #nitrogen patterns; + [#7rD2] 1 2; + [#7rD3] 1 2; [#7r](-@*)-@* 2 2; ...

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420. I'd like to make sure porphyrin rings (metallated or not) and ; phthalocyanines are typed correctly for the 2.0 final release. IMHO, these are the most common macrocyclic rings with significant ; conjugation. I see three possible (and independent) approaches:; 1) An explicit HEM ""residue"" in the PDB handling that adds bond orders ; correctly, much like other residues.; 2) Explicit typing rules in bondtyp.txt.; 3) Addition of a ring bond-order assignment step to the bondtyper.cpp ; code, independent of the functional group assignment. This can take ; aromaticity into account and propagate around a macrocycle ring. More examples of ligands would definitely help this effort. -Geoff.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420; Originator: NO. The ""audit log"" comments are more informative. The 2.1 version gives a quick summary of any warnings, errors, debugging information, etc. This way you can see if there were potential problems during conversion (or ignore if you like). The audit log keeps track of possible chemical transformations during conversion (e.g., creating bonds from a MOPAC file). The segmentation fault is fixed in the current SVN trunk. I'd be glad to give you an updated version or patch if you like. Obviously it should be fixed in 2.1.0 final release, which should come out in a week or three. The partial charges for MOPAC should be parsed correctly. But regular .mol files don't have partial charges as far as I know, so they aren't output. On the other hand, .mol2 files do, so you should seem them there. If not, please file another bug, or e-mail the mailing list.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: NO. I'm bumping up the priority as I've just spent an hour or two trying to figure out this problem myself, and it has also caused several bug reports to date. I suggest sorting this out in configure by adding some extra tests. Here is what I suggest:; (0) The user optionally sets BOOSTDIR. (1) If BOOSTDIR is defined, then add ""-DUSE_BOOST"" to DEFS, and ""-I$(BOOSTDIR)"" to INCLUDES. (2) configure should then try to compile a test program involving ""tr1/whatever"". If it succeeds, it sets a flag HAS_BOOSTLIKE_HEADERS. Otherwise, it prints a warning message saying ""It looks like you don't have the Boost headers so the following formats will not be compiled: chemdrawcdx, etc.. This is probably because you are using GCC3.x and don't have Boost installed. For more information, see http://openbabel.sf.net/Install (Source Code)"". (3) If HAS_BOOSTLIKE_HEADERS is not defined, don't compile any format that relies on the existence of Boost-like headers. (4) Update the documentation appropriately. I will do 4, and I can test 1-->3. (By the way, I note that although ./configure --includedir=whatever correctly sets includedir in the Makefile, the value of includedir does not seem to be incorporated into $INCLUDES.). Noel.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. I note that the conversion proceeds much better (perhaps even perfectly) if I first unset BABEL_DATADIR (on Windows). Setting BABEL_DATADIR is required for using FP3 from Python. However, something has gone wrong since the last release of OB and OBPython. It seems that OB cannot correctly read types.txt, nor patterns.txt, once you set BABEL_DATADIR. How do I know? Well, if I don't set BABEL_DATADIR, OB complains that it cannot find patterns.txt, but it correctly converts the MOL2 file in the Pybel test suite. If I set BABEL_DATADIR, it doesn't complain any longer about patterns.txt, but it cannot set any bits in the molecules (this exposed bug 1728410), nor can it correctly convert the MOL2 file in the Pybel test suite.

Deployability,"May you please clarify what represents for you a «3D builder»?. *Assuming* this refers to a program to set up a computation in a program like Gaussian, Gamess-UK, Games-US, etc. the state of a molecule as radical is described by the spin of the molecule, independent to assigning the molecule as neutral, or charged. As an example, [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) may either read a normal closed-shell molecule (like methane) from a `.mol` or `.sdf` or one may build one from which e.g., hydrogens are removed. With optional extensions you may then export this as as starting point for quantum chemistry calculations as illustrated below:*. ![example_avogadro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554375-3077e7f3-932e-40dc-b8b7-cc81995097c0.gif). Some assignments of charges and multiplicities for CH3 above only serve as illustration that it can be set up yet it shows that you can discern between e.g., methyl cation, methyl carbanion, and methy radical. In this perspective, Avogadro trades similar to interfaces like [gabedit](http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/). ![gabedit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554505-6e69ed1e-432b-4771-9996-c4bf568f104d.png).

Deployability,"Maybe I am wrong, my speculation however is you would like to define by yourself which program should display the .svg generated Openbabel when running the GUI. I think the developers' choice for a web browser like Firefox was that these programs capable to display the .svg as an image rather than a text typically already are installed. Running Linux Debian 11 bullseye (branch testing) comprising both OpenBabel (version 3.1.0) as well as the graphical editor [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (version 1.0.2) I use successfully the «display only» program of the later, `inkview` to inspect a single .svg by. `inkview example.svg &`. or to browse through a collection of .svg in a folder by. `inkview *.svg &`. As mentioned earlier [here](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/-/issues/3712#note_422339579), this works well for .svg generated by RDKit, but equally for .svg by OpenBabel. (For comparison, I attach reference data by both below.) Thus, if running `obgui` in Linux, I would welcome if it were possible to set a pointer like `/usr/bin/inkview %s` when instructing OpenBabel about which viewer to use. There are other programs to display .svg visually, too. Examples include [irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com/) if extended by the optional plugin; or [Xnview](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/), and `display` of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php). However, these often rasterize the display of the image; by consequence, the benefits scaling a vector image (crisp representation) may be lost.

Deployability,"Maybe your current interest is the conversion e.g., of .sdf into .xyz from the CLI (or, thanks to obgui, a GUI) only.

This contrasts to a later contribution to openbabel's source code (if you want).

Deployability,"Point 3) might be similar to problems installing openbabel in a virtual environment to run (Python) scripts from the plain CLI. Either try. a) uninstall openbabel by `pip uninstall openbabel`. Then install openbabel-wheel[1] by `pip install openbabel-wheel` instead. This bypass usually fixes some of the problems, and works fine at least in Windows, and Linux. The only edit necessary would be to update the `requirements.txt` file if you amend your virtual environment this way, but not the the Python scripts itself. b) use `python3-openbabel` as packaged for your favorite Linux distribution (example [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)), Windows + WSL environment. c) try a different ecosystem around your Python interpreter, for instance [Miniconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openbabel). It isn't necessary to give up standard [CPython](https://www.python.org/) for good -- there usually is no problem to have multiple interpreters on one computer. But it might require some adjustments on the side of the Jupyter notebook to engage the one you want to use.

Deployability,"Sorry for the slow reply. It's not too much trouble to put a new 3.0 package onto PyPI. @e-kwsm has already done most of the hard work in updating the `setup.py` script in #2060. Someone just needs to run `python setup.py sdist` in the `scripts/python` directory, then upload the result with `twine`. However... there is a bug in the 3.0 release that means that the pip install process will fail to find the OB include directory. This has since been fixed (#2059, @e-kwsm again, thanks!) but I would recommend against uploading the sdist until this fix is released (in 3.0.1?), otherwise it will just break `pip install...` for everyone who hasn't compiled the latest master from source. Honestly, this is just the latest example of how unreliable it is to install via pip with a sdist that relies on pkgconfig to find OB and then run swig at install time. I would strongly recommend people use conda instead, which has none of these problems. If people are really keen on pip, a better solution would probably be to create binary wheel files like Noel does for Windows, but I have no experience with this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2067#issuecomment-552146087:338,release,release,338,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2067#issuecomment-552146087,6,"['install', 'release']","['install', 'release', 'released']"

Deployability,Thanks for commenting @baoilleach :). As long as the functions are exposed (or there is another clever way to easily calculate what I need) then I see no problem with where things are stored in the C++ API. I used to use the `GetImplicitValence()` method on atoms in combination with `GetValence()` to figure out whether or not an atom needed to be given a hydrogen. Such a situation can arise if one needed to cut (in openbabel technically remove) a bond between a QM region and MM region with FragIt. I found an old blogpost of mine on the subject from almost 6 years ago (http://pythonchem.blogspot.dk/2012/01/adding-hydrogen-atoms-is-no-mean-feat.html) which explains it with a slightly different angle. The code I used has barely changed. The updated code (see https://github.com/FragIt/fragit-main/blob/develop/src/qmmm.py#L139) needs to know how many bonds really would like to be present and the following code apparently satisfies my testcases. Hope that explains how I used the old (and new) functionality.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1697#issuecomment-346318770:748,update,updated,748,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1697#issuecomment-346318770,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Thanks for pointing out that common Open Babel idiom. I had forgotten it. My patched doesn't touch Write(), only WriteString() and WriteFile(). Trying it out now I see that there is a problem. Here's my test code:; ```; >>> import pybel; >>> f = pybel.Outputfile(""cml"", ""spam.cml""); >>> f.write(pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C"")); >>> f.write(pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""O"")); >>> f.close(); ```; On a version of Open Babel without my patch, the output is:; ```; <molecule>; <atomArray>; <atom id=""a1"" elementType=""C""/>; </atomArray>; </molecule>; <molecule>; <atomArray>; <atom id=""a1"" elementType=""O""/>; </atomArray>; </molecule>; ```; On a version of Open Babel with my patch, the output is:; ```; <?xml version=""1.0""?>; <molecule xmlns=""http://www.xml-cml.org/schema"">; <atomArray>; <atom id=""a1"" elementType=""C"" hydrogenCount=""4""/>; </atomArray>; </molecule>; <?xml version=""1.0""?>; <molecule xmlns=""http://www.xml-cml.org/schema"">; <atomArray>; <atom id=""a1"" elementType=""O"" hydrogenCount=""2""/>; </atomArray>; </molecule>; ```; This is because pybel uses WriteFile() to open the file (which sets Index to 1), then calls Write() to re-use the already open file (keeping the Index at 1). This tells me two things: the CML format isn't designed to store multiple molecules, and Write() needs to increment the Index. I don't know how to handle the CML problem.

Deployability,"The `.mol` file submitted to openbabel misses an indication that the molecule is a radical (`RAD`); otherwise, the algorithm seems to work fine. This applies at least for openbabel 3.1.1 as the repositories of Linux Debian 12/bookworm (testing) currently provides (i.e., Mar 29 2022 update). For example, let the test page of [ChemDraw JS](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html#) create a methyl radical (there is a button name to structure) with an input of «methyl radical». ![2022-08-13_chemdraw_js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184505193-d7e5ba2c-83d6-425a-85ab-9e9000eca693.png). and subsequently, run structure -> get mol to obtain the following file:. ```; ACS Document 1996; ChemDraw08132219512D. 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0999 V2000; 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 C 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; M RAD 1 1 2; M STY 1 1 DAT; M SLB 1 1 1; M SAL 1 1 1; M SDD 1 -1.3654 -1.2329 DA ALL 1 5; M SED 1 methyl radical; M END; ```. Pasting this content into `test.mol` and running. ```bash; $ obabel test.mol -oinchi; InChI=1S/CH3/h1H3; 1 molecule converted; ```; does not lead to an additional fourth hydrogen atom. What appears to be missing in the `.mol` you present to the assignment of an InChI is the statement to retain the molecule as a radical (the line including the keyword `RAD`).

Deployability,"The coding style is fine -- we don't have a formal requirement. Most function names have initial capitals, but this is not rigorously enforced. (Some cleanup of coding style is underway for Open Babel 3.0.). I think the patch is generally good. The only problem is that if the element field is missing, it throws up a warning and can't set the atomic number. I think if the element field is missing (e.g., non-standard or just OLD files) it throw a warning and should use the previous (possibly buggy) logic. I've seen too many non-standard and old PDB files, which is why the code has a lot of patches. So if you can restore the old logic for missing element columns, I'll apply immediately. Thanks!.

Deployability,"The following can only cover some parts. Inferring from Linux Debian, Linux CentOS provides *some basic* support of Python; mainly to support the operating system itself. And if you perform a proper update of the operating system, then equally these supporting libraries are going to be updated. Now to your project. There is a set of modules deemed essential to Python; they constitute the Python standard library *every* Python installation includes, for instance `os`, `sys`, `argparse`. See for instance [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html). Additional functionality can be imported by additional libraries. One way to manage these *new dependencies* is by a `requirements.txt` file to list these modules -- preferably with indication of their (minimal) version known to work. For example. ```; CairoSVG>=2.7.1; openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16; rdkit>=2023.3.2; Requests>=2.31.0; ```. To keep the Python libraries which support your operating system in good shape, it is considered good practice to keep them separate (not accidentally modified) from packages used to develop and experiment with new packages. This is the background of using *virtual environments* which you. - first create, i.e. set up of a minimal clean Python environment; - second activate, i.e. to start using them; - third complement by additional Python packages (if needed) to provide additional functionality. *Here* the special file `requirements.txt` helps you because . ```shell; pip install -r ./requirements.txt; ```. is going to resolve the dependencies for you automatically. In case *virtual environments* is a concept new to you, Python documents it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Real Python offers a free [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) less technical if you prefer so. In each case: note that the commands in Windows, Linux, MacOS to toggle on/off the virtual environment differ ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034:199,update,update,199,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034,3,"['install', 'update']","['installation', 'update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"The molecule contains an alias, which is part of the molecule and should not normally be ignored. OB can read these aliases if they are in data/superatom.txt , and CCl3 is. But the alias is attached to the C of a CH3 group, which leads to some interpretation difficulties, (I know of no specifications). The CCl3 could replace the CH3 (probably intended). Or could become a CCl3H3 group with heptavalent carbon (Marvin draws it this way). Or it could be ignored. Even though this is an erroneous molecule, it has shown up a bug in the alias expansion. The crash occurs in the 3D stereo code because the expanded atoms are wrongly given 3D coordinates in a 2D molecule. I will try to correct this before the next release. The 3D stereo code also could probably benefit from being more robust to erroneous input.

Deployability,"The png format in OpenBabel does not make a png image. When writing, it just embeds a chemical file inside an existing png file. When reading, it exacts the chemical information in this form from a png file. Try babel -Hpng or the Format info in the GUI. The released versions of OpenBabel do not make images (other than povray). The development code (which will be eventually be in the next released version) contains 2-D depiction in svg (designed to display as an image in Firefox, etc.). A Beta Snapshot 2.2.99b1 of this code will be available on March 1 2010. It is likely that output to a wider range of image formats will come later. You might like to look at an on-line image service at http://depict.emolecules.com/ which is based on OpenBabel, but the image generation code I think is proprietary. InChIKey was not designed to be converted back to real chemical information. If you search for ""Inchikey resolver"" there are a number of services which I assume use database methods to associate an InChIKey with a molecule. I don't think OpenBabel will ever do this.; ; You could make a web converter, like the OASA one, for text output now and with images with the development code. I look forward to it!.

Deployability,"There are two separate problems here:. 1) The external build scripts for the Perl and Python bindings assume that libopenbabel will be in lib/, and they can't handle it if the library is instead in lib64/. CMake will put it in lib64/ if you tell it -DLIB_SUFFIX=64, which is the appropriate thing to do on a multilib system. . 2) The CMake build instructions for the Ruby bindings pass ""--with-openbabel-lib=${BABEL_LIBRARY}"" whereas what is wanted is ""--with-openbabel-lib=${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}"". That is, the library name is passed instead of the library directory. The latter is particularly insidious. If there is a pre-existing libopenbabel in the linker's library search path then the ${BABEL_LIBRARY} version will find and link against that, thus (a) masking the error, and (b) possibly recording the wrong soname as a dependency of the Ruby bindings.

Deployability,"This is more a commentary to improve the presentation of your question, than as to provide a solution:; + Update openbabel. With version 2.4.1 you mention, you limit your work to what was implemented by 2016. Though your code snippet to translate .smi into .xyz still is functional today, the present stable version is 3.1.1 ([reference](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases)). Because it is possible that if you encounter a problem (or a bug in the underlying source code), this has been addressed since then. + You face a problem with the second example converting the .xyz into a .smi because the representation of the structure contains a pentavalent carbon. Pick up the the two .xyz files (of both examples) you want to convert into SMILES, stash these files into a folder in common, and submit them as .zip archive by drag-and-drop. By this complement to your question, you allow others to replicate your conversion (and perhaps the newer/contemporary version of openbabel trades this conversion better than version 2.4.1).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2484#issuecomment-1148276921:106,Update,Update,106,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2484#issuecomment-1148276921,2,"['Update', 'release']","['Update', 'releases']"

Deployability,"This was a ""feature"" when it was deliberately introduced about six years ago. I'm not sure that it is so dangerous that it needs over-hasty reaction just before a release. To have input and output files the same:; - on the command line, you have deliberately typed the same file name twice.; - on the GUI you have been warned when you entered the output file name.; - in a program or a script, and the names are not explicit, maybe the program should be more carefully constructed to avoid unwanted overwriting. There are legitimate uses for having the input and output files the same. Suppose you wanted to add a new molecule from a mol file to an existing cml file. obabel thecmlfile.cml extra.mol -O thecmlfile.cml. does this very nicely, without the tedious file deletion and renaming that would be necessary if you couldn't have the output and input the same. Editors of all kinds routinely read and write to the same file. OB is an editor sometimes: make the hydrogens explicit:. obabel file.mol -O file.mol -h. The command-line is not set up for interactivity; it has be an acceptance or a prohibition. I would favour acceptance. Chris.

Side notes:. - dash, colon, pairwise single/double quotes in `-:""c1ccccc1""` already indicate to OpenBabel ""the input enclosed by the quotes is going to be a SMILES string"". - if the file extension is one described by the manual (cf. [readthedocs](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), the explicit indication can be dropped. Indeed, `-icml` in the instruction `obabel -icml aromatic_cml.txt -osmi` only was necessary because the input file *of .cml syntax* uses a non-conventional file extension for a .cml, namely `.txt`.

Thanks @baoilleach, I tried keeping a reference to each reactants Molecule in my Reaction class (which I had been planning on doing anyway but hadn't remembered and hadn't needed to use yet) and that seems to keep all of the Atom instances valid at least in my initial tests involving what hadn't worked previously. Destroying all atoms owned by a Molecule in the Molecule's destructor seems like reasonable design but is that documented anywhere? If not should it be added somewhere (by me or someone else)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1602#issuecomment-317216423:602,pipeline,pipeline,602,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1602#issuecomment-317216423,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Contrary to your report, I did not observe any error report at all. I then read the `.sdf` in an old instance of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05), the viewer recognized the presence of four models. It was possible to display them one by one (on Jmol's console, this requires an input in pattern of `load ""OUT.sdf"" 1`) and the geometries do not look terribly skewed either. Equally, there was no problem to import the `.sdf`import into [DataWarrior](http://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/index.html) (version 5.2.1, 2020) to write a `.dwar` file either.

I am still wondering about what should happen in cases where the element symbol and the atomic number don't agree.

So far, Open Babel uses the atomic number and disregards the element symbol, which caused converted geometries to have mostly wrong elements.

Deployability,"`pdbqt` (similar to, say `.pdb`, or `.xyz`) is one of the file formats OpenBabel may read _and_ write. It is not an executable / library like `obgrep`, or the `obgui` are. If working well, `pdbqt` should be visible as input / output in the GUI of OpenBabel, or -- from the CLI / cmd.exe --the command of `obabel -L pdbqt` should provide basically the same content as the current [documentation](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) section 18.12.2 (or, in the .pdf version, page 201).

(intentionally stopped by `Ctrl + C`, hence the `^C`) still displays the obstacle. So your report obabel in iOS would trade better than Debian is worth to note for those with access to both operating systems. Maybe the SMILES was derived from a .sdf already problematic?. Because I'm not aware (yet) of a checker for SMILES in regard of consistency (like for Python [online](https://www.online-ide.com/online_python_syntax_checker), or `pylint` for the CLI; or [checkcif](http://checkcif.iucr.org/) for crystal structure data; or the CIP validator by Hanson et al. ([2018JChemInfModel1755](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00324))), the mentioned cdk-depict sometimes serves me to spot a (potentially) problematic SMILES string: enter e.g., `CC=CC` and the wavy bond indicates the configuration of the double bound is not defined. With the optional display of CIP labels, there equally will be an explicit question mark; this contrasts to `C\C=C\C`, `C\C=C/C`, `C/C=C\C`, and `C/C=C/C`:. ![butene_variations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/203751096-2be1d298-3c71-4a57-acc2-8098cb449534.png). Regarding the second part: thankfully, obabel is equally available as a `.deb` package *prêt-à-porter*/ready to go (Debian's [tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)). There might be a delta in time and functionality between the executables either compiled from the source code here (GitHub), and the one *via* the repositories of DebiChem. With Debian *branch testing* (at present, Debian 12/bookworm) one may consider more like a *rolling release* (comparison to Debian stable, or LTS releases in the Ubuntu family), I do not perceive the delays as problematic.

Deployability,"cript below performs a conversion explicitly requesting both standard output as well as the error stream. For unproblematic SMILES (i.e., entries reporting back with two lines [or line-feed separated records, in parlance of AWK]) the canonical SMILES string is provided. Though written for Linux Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing), by use of AWK, this approach aims to be portable for other platforms (maybe others may check on this). Reporting only the (processed) canonical SMILES passing the filter successfully equally should be helpful when running OpenBabel with the optional `--errorlevel <N>` (default 2 out of 5, cf. [section 3.2](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Command-line_tools/babel.html)). ```awk; #!/usr/bin/awk -f. # name: filter.awk; # author: nbehrnd@yahoo.com; # license: GPL v2, 2022; # date: <2022-03-23 Wed>; # edit: <2022-03-28 Mon>. # Retain ""reasonable"" SMILES strings OpenBabel may process gently.; #; # For a successful application of this filter, this AWK script depends; # on a running installation of OpenBabel and AWK. (Tests suggest you may; # use GNU AWK/gawk and nawk instead of AWK as well.); #; # Write a list of SMILES into the same directory as this AWK script, e.g.,; # as file check01.smi. Then deploy this filter e.g., by; #; # awk -f filter.awk check01.smi; #; # to process the content of the list of SMILES. The output is a list of; # canonical SMILES which OpenBabel has no difficulty to process.

Deployability,"g is provided. Though written for Linux Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing), by use of AWK, this approach aims to be portable for other platforms (maybe others may check on this).

Deployability,"ip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2. This however is more and more ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1191,install,installation,1191,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,1,['install'],['installation']

Deployability,"ivities in this example is larger, than in your example of the carbene complex. However, Gold Book equally features an entry coordination[2b] with the statement. «The synonym 'dative bond' is obsolete. (The origin of the bonding electrons has by itself no bearing on the character of the bond formed. Thus, the formation of methyl chloride from a methyl cation and a chloride ion involves coordination; the resultant bond obviously differs in no way from the C–Cl bond in methyl chloride formed by any other path, e.g. by colligation of a methyl radical and a chlorine atom.)». which is more similar to your argument ""use a plain line"". I don't know why then IUPAC's Gold Book (still) retains an entry about dative bonds. The test site of ChemDraw JS[3] -- which should be the easiest for the owner to update (once CambridgeSoft -- Brecher's affiliation 2008 -- meanwhile acquired by Perkin), uses dative bonds and again the arrow. A query of PubChem for ZnPc[4] yields a 2D model which does not deploy arrows to the more electropositive metal, but instead dotted lines. It seems to be their pattern adopted, based on the 2018 publication «PubChem chemical structure standardization»[5] by authors involved in PubChem's work (figs 13, 20b, 29b, 29c).

Deployability,"nbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2. This however is more and more an exception.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1314,install,installed,1314,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,3,['install'],"['install', 'installed']"

Deployability,"oggle on/off the virtual environment differ of each other. The advantage of this development *separate* from the libraries used by your operating system: you don't harm your OS. If you are stuck in an error, deactivate the virtual environment, delete the whole folder of this virtual environment, and start all over from scratch. Obviously, for your project, you have to identify and use *your project's* `requirements.txt`. If there is no `requirements.txt`, get in touch with the author of the application. Else, set up a virtual environment, activate it and install [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to quickly generate a `requirements.txt` about all non-standard Python modules your project requires. *But:* `pipreqs` does not know about openbabel-wheel -- which is why a manual edit in `requirements.txt` is necessary. Try then if your application can be started and used as described by its documentation. An aspect specific point to `openbabel` (from pypi.org) and `openbabel-wheels` (from pypi.org): `openbabel-wheels` as a bypass aims to install where normally `openbabel` would be. In case you already installed `openbabel` in your virtual environment, you then must deinstall `openbabel` (by the command `pip remove openbabel`) in first place before an installation of `openbabel-wheel` is successful. Last but not least I see your `cmake` command. If you work with *an activated* virtual environment of Python, the address of the python interpreter is different from the usually used one. (Of course, because you do not want to harm your operating system.) So your command. ```shell; which python; ```. which *normally* points to `/usr/bin/python`* now (again, in the working/activated *virtual environment* of Python) points to a different location of your python interpreter within your virtual environment. Edit your command accordingly and use the address of the interpreter within the active virtual environment. \* which might be itself a symbolic link to the interpreter",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034:3015,install,install,3015,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034,3,['install'],"['install', 'installation', 'installed']"

Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing) occasionally is ahead of Ubuntu when it comes to programs the DebiChem project repackages. In the case of OpenBabel, this is the case ([tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)) with version 3.1.1 available since June 2021. So I once removed all packages related to OpenBabel, and started from scratch with the combination of `sudo apt-get install openbabel python3-openbabel`. Then again, OpenBabel from the CLI as well from within Python are installed without warning, and work as anticipated:. ```; norwid@carnot2:~$ lsb_release -a; No LSB modules are available.; Distributor ID:	Debian; Description:	Debian GNU/Linux bookworm/sid; Release:	testing; Codename:	bookworm; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ obj; objcopy objdump ; norwid@carnot2:~$ obj; objcopy objdump ; norwid@carnot2:~$ python pip uninstall openbabel; python: can't open file '/home/norwid/pip': [Errno 2] No such file or directory; norwid@carnot2:~$ python3 pip uninstall openbabel; python3: can't open file '/home/norwid/pip': [Errno 2] No such file or directory; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ # get OpenBabel; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ sudo apt-get install openbabel python3-openbabel; [sudo] password for norwid: ; Reading package lists...

Deployability,"recognize what type of SMILES string is offered to; you. In this perspective, I perceive OpenBabel as advantageous in; comparison to ChemDraw because with toggles like `-osmi` or `-ocan`; you may explicitly define which «dialect» the SMILES will be (e.g.,; canonical, universal, inchified). Like with any programs, as soon as you interface with other programs,; the lack of convention (or deployment of programs designed to adhere; different conventions), this may be anything in the spectrum of; «below the detection limit», «nuisance», and «incompatible». Say you; successfully load the structure in the JS of ChemDraw mentioned; earlier and request the interface to provide the SMILES string. You; may feed this string into OpenBabel in a pattern like. ```bash; obabel -:""c1ccncc1"" -osmi; ```. to ask OpenBabel for a SMILES representation (here about pyridine,; just substitute the SMILES string from ChemDraw accordingly). Here,; `-osmi` and `-ocan` yield the same SMILES string. With a molecule; more complex, like the cyclic one of yours, however, you are going to; recognize differences how input vs. output may differ, and how; different output options yield different SMILES generated by; OpenBabel, too. I don't know what you intend to do with the SMILES strings in hand.; Given observations like the ones mentioned above, I however notice my; tendency to withdraw from them and to deploy either InChI (for the; description and recreation of the structures), or InChIKey (their; hashes, for a convenient recognition of identity of two entries). For reasons beyond your initial question, I currently use one of the; handy reference implementations available for free (as in free beer); from the InChI trust.[1] These are compiled to run from the get-go; with 32 or 64 bit (either Windows or Linux, no separate Mac version); from the CLI to perform the assignment on (multi-model) .sdf files.; OpenBabel equally offers an interface to these two formats. https://www.inchi-trust.org/downloads/",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358:1479,deploy,deploy,1479,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358,1,['deploy'],['deploy']

Deployability,"s are contained within that; install. I used conda-forge to install openbabel v3.1.0 and subsequently; pybel. The error output I sent was from Windows v2004 and I sent that one; because MACOS just said ""segmentation fault"". I figured the Windows output; was a little more useful.

OpenBabel however issues a warning/error _interpreted_ as serious enough to remove this entry for good:. ```bash; $ obabel -:""CC(O/C(\CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(CC=C)=C)OC(O)=C)O)=C(\COC)/OCO)=O"" -ocan; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in CreateCisTrans; Error in cis/trans stereochemistry specified for the double bond. COCC(=C(OC(=O)C)CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(=C)CC=C)OC(=C)O)O)OCO 1 molecule converted; ```. The meaning of the formulae provided by CDKDepict[2] did not alter -- e.g., no change in the configuration of the stereogenic centers, and the double bond still can't be assigned to match either the pattern of (E), or (Z):. ![2022-03-30_CDKDepict_entry04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/160856599-8123cc0e-39b3-44b7-a2be-019bf7d5294b.png). Because I'm not aware if OpenBabel can resolve such ambiguities (here: to return one SMILES string with the explicit (E), and an other SMILES string with the explicit (Z) double bond) -- wouldn't be the more strict (pedantic?) remove of this entry an; advantage to address specific configurations?*. Last (but not least), the explicit return of problematic SMILES. The in-silico generation of molecules as SMILES appeared to me as affordable (enough) to skip entries with SMILES OpenBabel/partialsmiles perceive as problematic. Thus my change to focus on SMILES approved by partialsmiles/OpenBabel may process (the complementary set). The above SMILES string yielding a warning because of extended stereochemistry (options for .and. and .or.) equally calls for an adjustment of the parameters how the molecules are generated (outside OpenBabel) to use only SMILES with unambiguous stereochemistry. ---. *) On a tangent, this reminds me a bit to the extended stereochemistry options in .sdf (v3000 format) with logical .and. and .or. as seen e.g., in a presentation[3] by Andrey Yerin's about how to possibly improve InChI:. ![2022-03-30_Yerin_InChI]",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256:1787,configurat,configurations,1787,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256,1,['configurat'],['configurations']

Deployability,"tom Ids as follows: 20; Warning: Stereochemistry is wrong, using the distance geometry method instead; ^C; ```. (intentionally stopped by `Ctrl + C`, hence the `^C`) still displays the obstacle. So your report obabel in iOS would trade better than Debian is worth to note for those with access to both operating systems. Maybe the SMILES was derived from a .sdf already problematic?. Because I'm not aware (yet) of a checker for SMILES in regard of consistency (like for Python [online](https://www.online-ide.com/online_python_syntax_checker), or `pylint` for the CLI; or [checkcif](http://checkcif.iucr.org/) for crystal structure data; or the CIP validator by Hanson et al. ([2018JChemInfModel1755](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00324))), the mentioned cdk-depict sometimes serves me to spot a (potentially) problematic SMILES string: enter e.g., `CC=CC` and the wavy bond indicates the configuration of the double bound is not defined. With the optional display of CIP labels, there equally will be an explicit question mark; this contrasts to `C\C=C\C`, `C\C=C/C`, `C/C=C\C`, and `C/C=C/C`:. ![butene_variations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/203751096-2be1d298-3c71-4a57-acc2-8098cb449534.png). Regarding the second part: thankfully, obabel is equally available as a `.deb` package *prêt-à-porter*/ready to go (Debian's [tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)). There might be a delta in time and functionality between the executables either compiled from the source code here (GitHub), and the one *via* the repositories of DebiChem. With Debian *branch testing* (at present, Debian 12/bookworm) one may consider more like a *rolling release* (comparison to Debian stable, or LTS releases in the Ubuntu family), I do not perceive the delays as problematic. After preparing a package, improvements unrelated to security stay in the purgatory of Debian's branch *unstable* (or sid) for about 5 days; if accepted, they then percolate into *testing*.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2317#issuecomment-1326200644:2499,rolling,rolling,2499,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2317#issuecomment-1326200644,3,"['release', 'rolling']","['release', 'releases', 'rolling']"

Starting in line 50, the moderator script includes a `try/except ValueError` clause:. ```python; try:; rdkit.Chem.rdDetermineBonds.DetermineBonds(mol, charge=args.charge); print(Chem.MolToMolBlock(mol)); except ValueError:; print(; ""The attributed global charge by `-c` is incompatible with bond orders assigned.""; ); ```. The (now explicitly assumed) overall neutral molecule. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz --charge 0; ```. yields the data for a .sdf where as for exemple a net single negative the moderator reports. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c -1; The attributed global charge by `-c` is incompatible with bond orders assigned.; ```. Non-integer charges are barred from entry altogether (by `formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter` in line 24, and more importantly, `type=int,` in line 36). ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c 0.4; usage: xyz2mol_b.py [-h] [-c int] FILE; xyz2mol_b.py: error: argument -c/--charge: invalid int value: '0.4'; ```. With these elements in place, one can imagine some iterations. A first guess of a shell script for Debian's bash, if one has to check a single .xyz only:. ```shell; for i in {-5..5}; do; echo ""$i""; python ./xyz2mol_b.py ./structure.xyz -c ""$i"" > out_""$i"".sdf; done; ```. which can shortened further as the moderator script contains an adjustable shebang.

Energy Efficiency,"> @schatzsc I redrew the structure on the test page of Marvin JS ([link](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/demo.html)) using the coordinate/dative bond. Pt was assigned a positive charge, Br for compensation a negative one:. @nbehrnd As also mentioned in the [Chemotion issue](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/issues/1551) metal-ligand bonds MUST NOT be broken. This will also be the standard in the latest upcoming IUPAC InChI recommendations on organometallics. Furthermore, ""dative"" bonds have no relevancy at least in coordination and organometallic chemistry of the d- and f-elements - all those bonds are more or less polar covalent bonds. The best solution would actually for atoms and bonds to be marked with an attribute ""don't touch"" in terms of bond order and addition of implicit hydrogens and M-L ""lines"" simply be taken as an indication of a bonding interaction without any implication on the electron count. In the context of [TUCAN](https://github.com/TUCAN-nest/TUCAN) we have called these ""simple bonds"".

Energy Efficiency,"> If I grab a PDB file from RCSB, there are no explicit hydrogens:. It depends how the structure was generated. If it was determined with crystallography, there won't be any hydrogens because they can't be resolved from the electron density. If it's an NMR structure, it probably will include hydrogens. > How about this heuristic.. if the PDB file already has hydrogens, the default should be to assume all hydrogens are explicit?. That seems reasonable. Adding hydrogens to proteins needs to be done very carefully though. A lot of side chains are charged, so you don't want to just automatically fill in a hydrogen everywhere one could possibly go. And of course it depends on pH. Even if you assume you're only interested in pH 7, there still can be ambiguity. HIS has two forms that are equally common at pH 7, with the hydrogen on either ND1 or NE2. If one of the two is able to form a hydrogen bond, that stabilizes it, so you want to look at potential bonding partners to select which is more likely. In the example above, the file already has a hydrogen on CE1, and it adds a second one. That doesn't match any common form at any pH. So I guess there are three parts to the solution. 1. Provide an option for whether to add hydrogens.; 2. The default value for that option should depend on whether the file already has any hydrogens.; 3. Check the logic it uses for adding hydrogens, since there appear to currently be some cases where it creates unrealistic, nonphysical structures.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796:550,charge,charged,550,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796,1,['charge'],['charged']

Energy Efficiency,"@RaphaelRobidas Contrasting to the mandatory Hill formula, the charge layer only is added to the InChI if the underlying structure is charged. The automatic charge recognition is embedded in the algorithm to yield the standard InChI. To best of my knowledge, this is not a parameter InChI trust's reference executables currently (version 1.6 by December 2021) offer to toggle off/relax as they do for the perception of stereochemistry. (And if engaged, this no longer yields the standard InChI `1S/...`, but one non-standard InChI `1/...`. Well, one .or. multiple options may be engaged simultaneously to yield *a* non-standard InChI; so *standard* is *agreed convention*.).

Energy Efficiency,"@baoilleach - please see example below. The only trick to let MOPAC calculate multiple molecules in a single file, is to separate multiple molecules by an empty line CR/LF. . @ghutchis - thank you, its great to read something like this, especially for people bit outside the field like me. MMFF94 is just so embedded in the minds, and DFT on 1000 molecules is still too far away, but PM7 runs literally in seconds, so really doable (besides all the conversion issues). For docking one could also use PM6-D3H4 which is a bit more accurate and maybe COSMO if needed. The general workflow I use is; 1) SMILES to 3D SDF (add H and generate MMFF94 low energy conformer); 2) 3D SDF to XYZ (XYZ needed for input in other tools or DFT calculations); 3) XYZ to MOPAC cartesian (need to add MOPAC keywords and single CR/LF separator); 4) MOPAC ARC/OUT to optimized SDF (needed for pipeline and additional handling). Now one can process 100k molecules in a single file and then parse the output like; IP, HOMO, LUMO, COSMO volume, pkA and other values. Best would be of course; to have all the calculated properties added as SDF fields but that is another story.; (One could use the https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/SDF_toolkit/ to add or remove properties). **Example MOPAC input file with three molecules:** ; ````; PM7 OPT XYZ; Methane.

In old `pybel.py`, since the format `noel` is not supported at the very beginning, the `format-error` will be raised firstly, by using returned Boolean variable `formatok`, which is just like assumed. . However, in new updated codes, the function becomes: `pybel.readfile(format=None, filename=None, opt=None)`, because the argument `filename` is always required, so to be efficient, it is being checked first. Due to file path of `head.sdf` is `python/examples/head.sdf`, but does not exist at `where-the-ctest-being-executed`, thus the error `IOError` will be raised, yet it is not equivalent with the expected `ValueError`, coded in:. ```; # file: scripts/python/examples/testpybel.py.

Energy Efficiency,"I don't think that the lack of explicit connectivity is a huge issue here, it can be guessed quite accurately from the interatomic distances. As long as there aren't any clashes (non-bonded atoms at a distance near the sum of their covalent radii), the bonds are trivial to identify. After all, it's not like Gaussview or Avogadro have some special information about the bonding of the molecule; it outputs the bonds that the user created, which do not have to be chemically reasonable (e.g., bonded atoms very far away or non-bonded atoms very close). At that point, it is debatable whether the correct connectivity if the one chosen by the user or the one that would be computed using DFT/WFT. Another option is to use a cheap method like GFN2-xTB to calculate the effective bonds and charges in the molecule, giving quite sensible connectivities in `MOL` format. But then, again, it does not seem to set `M CHG` or `M RAD` either, so we're back to the same issue. Are the charges/radicals really necessary to generate the InChI?

Energy Efficiency,"I have the same problem with version 2.4.1 on Gentoo, reading output from GAMESS-US ver. 11 Nov 2017 (R3). I did some debugging and I found the problem to be in actual part of **gamessformat.cpp** that reads frequencies. Namely in line **515**, before reading reduced mass, it should also read SYMMETRY line:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; Fixed:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // SYMMETRY; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; otherwise lines **549-550** process a blank line instead of an atom - hence the segfault. Patch is attached that fixes the code. Here is a fragment of the GAMESS output where the problem appears:; > FREQUENCY: 2.93 1.88 0.55 0.35 0.16; > SYMMETRY: E E E E E; > REDUCED MASS: 6.79503 6.40438 13.42881 10.66293 9.71937; > IR INTENSITY: 0.23456 0.34034 0.01209 0.00004 0.00182. The second issue arises at the end of the loop that reads the modes (lines **582-584**):; ```; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE);; tokenize(vs, buffer);; modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; At the end of the modes `buffer` variable contains empty string, so `vs.size()` returns 0. However, `modeCount` is defined as `unsigned int` (in line **544**):; ```; unsigned int modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; therefore line **584** produces a huge positive value instead of -3, and the program does not leave the loop (condition in line **547**), leading to another segfault, which wasn't exposed due to the first one.

Energy Efficiency,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1189615; Originator: NO. The rule now is:; ""If any explicit non-isotopically-specified hydrogens are present, then ALL hydrogens for this heavy atom are fully specified."" This is stated in line 2055 of mol.cpp but maybe there should be a general writeup on implicit hydrogens somewhere else. I realize that you will not find this rule very satisfactory. Using implicit hydrogens is a convenience but is prone to misinterpretation unless there are hard and fast rules, which there aren't in SDF files, as far as I know. I think the best we can do is to fit in with what the user probably wanted. I think these three examples do this: in a structure with implicit hydrogens the user often wants to highlight where the D atoms are; but nobody would write methane with only one hydrogen, so he/she must mean the molecule CH . If you wanted to represent the molecule CD you would have to use a M RAD line with a value of 4, which is interpreted by OB but is not legal SDF, although it is a very obvious extension. You would also be taking a lot of notice of whether it was being interpreted correctly, which you might not be with the first two examples. So I think we cover all types of user. Incidentally, in SMILES the Daylight theory manual says ""Within brackets, any attached hydrogens and formal charges must always be specified."" I take this to mean ""there is no implicit hydrogen on bracketed atoms."". With the molecules:; [CH3][2H] [CH2][2H] [CH][2H] [C][2H]; Depict draws the same picture for all and gives warnings of hydrogen deficiency for the 2nd and 4th, but surprisingly not the 3rd.

The strdup() function allocates sufficient memory for a copy of the string str, does the copy, and returns a pointer to it. The pointer may subsequently be used as an argument to the function free(3). My code my have problems but I never release something that frequently crashes and since I call free() on that pointer later, I'm pretty sure it is properly allocated.

Sorry, I should have attached an example input anyway.; I downloaded/compiled the beta version you mention. The good thing is that it does the conversion. The bad ones are:; 1) I get this message:. 23 audit log messages; (the number depends on the output format). 2) It doesn't matter how I run babel I get a ""Segmentation fault"" at the end. Since the conversion is done this is not really a problem, just that it's not very elegant ;-).

Energy Efficiency,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib. I don't think that a binary lib could compete with that, for the kind of small fixed-size matrices that OB is using.

Energy Efficiency,"May you please clarify what represents for you a «3D builder»?. *Assuming* this refers to a program to set up a computation in a program like Gaussian, Gamess-UK, Games-US, etc. the state of a molecule as radical is described by the spin of the molecule, independent to assigning the molecule as neutral, or charged. As an example, [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) may either read a normal closed-shell molecule (like methane) from a `.mol` or `.sdf` or one may build one from which e.g., hydrogens are removed. With optional extensions you may then export this as as starting point for quantum chemistry calculations as illustrated below:*. ![example_avogadro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554375-3077e7f3-932e-40dc-b8b7-cc81995097c0.gif). Some assignments of charges and multiplicities for CH3 above only serve as illustration that it can be set up yet it shows that you can discern between e.g., methyl cation, methyl carbanion, and methy radical. In this perspective, Avogadro trades similar to interfaces like [gabedit](http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/). ![gabedit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554505-6e69ed1e-432b-4771-9996-c4bf568f104d.png).

Energy Efficiency,"Maybe something with the SMILES you process is wrong, which could be accidental (e.g., manual entry to a database), or systematic (a computer program generates the molecules/SMILES). Especially if it is for the later, it would be worth to identify the SMILES currently causing the problem in first place before engaging the generation of 2D or 3D structure for a .mol file. It is possible to run the program with SMILES as input as well as output format, e.g., by -ocan. Since SMILES of one (more complex) structure may differ depending on the algorithm/implementation used (e.g., universal, inchified, canonical SMILES in OpenBabel), this often is a good first (or zeroth) step when working with SMILES from different sources/databases anyway. To retain the problematic SMILES, it then might be a question of reading out the error stream, or a try-escape clause (in Python) to check if it is an error in SMILES syntax causing OpenBabel's message. If the molecule in question contains a great number of bonds which -- in principle -- are flexible to rotation, the conversion SMILES -> 3D structure may take substantially more time, than for rigid molecules (note that --gen3d only is one of five levels to guess a conformer, see the manual) though the syntax of the SMILES is a correct one. If you only want one conformer to start with, and not need the of lowest energy (OpenBabel equally offers a systematic conformer search), the two-step SMILES -> 2D (--gen2d) into a .mol, and subsequent 2D mol -> 3D mol (with --gen3d) sometimes is faster (this assumes you have a valid SMILES in first place).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2530#issuecomment-1229902870:1364,energy,energy,1364,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2530#issuecomment-1229902870,1,['energy'],['energy']

The Pubchem 3D shows the hydrogen in more detail. My point is that obabel's depiction of this molecule with the flags I used provides an image structure where this H 'protrudes' below the molecule, but in line with a C-C bond in the ring it is a member of, so you have both lines running in the same direction, one on top of the other, and although this may structurally possible, for the purposes of depicting the structure, it is less clear than the two references included above. Now this may be because I'm using obabel incorrectly, and if so, totally cool. But although I'm new to the notion of implicit and explicit hydrogens in the context of cheminformatics and 2D structure depictions, the flags I have used have hidden all the implicit hydrogens, but not the case H in point which appears to be nonetheless plotted, but in a way which is confusing, and irrespective, I was urged to log this as a bug by Geoff, so assumed it was therefore a bug. Therefore, I'm hoping that either; 1. Someone with authority admits this is a bug; 2.

Energy Efficiency,"Point a) I would describe this task as ""extend what obabel already can do""; Point b) I'm not aware if RDKit offers an interface to Materials Studio / .bgf files. The suggest to use multiple tools (the .sdf reconstruction with xyz2mol/RDKit, the preparation of .bgf with obabel) might be unfortunate for splitting the attention on two tools instead of one for the overall .xyz -> .bgf task ahead, but I presume the preparation of .bgf has to run only once and hence ""acceptable"". Point c) can one the tools detect if the .xyz is ionic? No, by now I do not think so. The method `xyz2mol` can be ambiguous because the charge parameter i) is *the overall charge*, i.e. an amino acid with simultaneous presence of ammonium and carboxylate is seen as neutral. And ii) no error is reported if the same data set about the cation is processed with `-c -1`, i.e. ```shell; $ python ./xyz2mol_b.py KAXWOV_cation_xyz.xyz -c -1 > negative.sdf; $ obabel negative.sdf -O negative.bgf; 1 molecule converted; ```. ![negative](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/01e25457-b8ff-4426-a659-969820435ce1).

Energy Efficiency,"Thank you so much for looking into my problem!; I tried `obabel -ipdb ligand_1.pdb -h -opdb -O add_h.pdb` in my environment and it results as you described. It kept the original atom label and the residue name. While, there are still 2 problems about this:; 1. The `--p ph` flag and the python usage `mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(False, True, ph)` still do not keep atom label and residue name, which the ph will make big difference on the result. In my result with ph=7.0, the phosphates are all deprotonated and openbabel gives a good formal charge along with the connectivity. ; 2. Even in the way that keeps atom label and residue name, there's no different name for newly added Hydrogens. I looked into the naming rule of tleap in Amber and it is just simply adding element count after the element name. Like this:; ```; HETATM 59 H UNL 1 66.036 57.777 14.518 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 60 H1 UNL 1 69.447 60.888 17.041 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 61 H2 UNL 1 67.790 60.750 17.415 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 62 H3 UNL 1 72.206 58.616 13.563 1.00 0.00 H ; ```.

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks for the reminder - sorry for the very slow review. It looks okay. My last concern is that with the current implementation, there's nothing guaranteeing that a molecule will have a full set of partial charges. I think I'd prefer that the OBPartialCharge class only accept charges as a full vector<double> and checks to make sure it's equal to the number of atoms before storing. The reader should then push_back() into a temporary vector in the gauss format.cpp code. This way, if there's somehow a corrupted file (e.g., it got killed by the queuing software before the job finished) the partial charges are still safe - it won't store a set of ESP charges that are only half the molecule. I realize that's an unlikely case, but I'm trying to think from the library API perspective - you can access a set of vector<double> but set the charges one-by-one.

Energy Efficiency,"The InChI string is a layered representation of the chemical structure; it contains at least the Hill formula and connectivity of the backbone atoms (in case of organic molecules, C, N, O, P, S, etc. but not H) are read from the .sdf/.mol file. *If* the structure described is charged, there will be an additional layer e.g., `q+1` (for single positive), or `q-1` (for single negative), too. Thus,. + processing a radical like the methyl radical yields. ```shell; $ obabel -:""[CH3]"" -oinchi; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in InChI code; #1 :Accepted unusual valence(s): C(3); InChI=1S/CH3/h1H3; 1 molecule converted; ```. + while the methyl cation yields; ```shell; $ obabel -:""[CH3+]"" -oinchi; InChI=1S/CH3/h1H3/q+1; 1 molecule converted; ```. + and the methyl carbanion; ```shell; $ obabel -:""[CH3-]"" -oinchi; InChI=1S/CH3/h1H3/q-1; 1 molecule converted; ```. These three InChI strings are dissimilar of each other.

In Open Babel, two additions were made with respect to the official MOL2. See: https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileFormats/Sybyl_Mol2_format.html?highlight=mol2. 1. Explicit declaration of the formal charges in the UNITY_ATOM_ATTR section (part of the official MOL2 specifications). No inference of the formal charge based on the atom types.

Energy Efficiency,"With openbabel 3.1.0 as provided in Linux Debian 11 / bullseye (branch testing) and your .pdb I performed the default protonation, i.e. `obabel -ipdb ligand_1.pdb -h -opdb add_h.pdb`. The newly written .pdb lists all atoms including the label `4CO`, too. Contrasting to the original file submitted, the new .pdb has an additional trailing column about the atom type. For most of the protonation suggested, chemically speaking (number of protons added, spatial arrangement vs. C, N, O), the results look plausible. The protonation of the phosphates _may_ be different. In the export of the protonated structure as .svg, the P=O in the terminal monophosphate is represented differently, than the P=O in the diphosphates. Possibly this is influenced on the P-O bond lengths determined. For a test, I reduced the information available in the .pdb about the protonated ligand to a SMILES string and let the structure recreate; the then displayed structure recreated from the SMILES does look plausible. Maybe this result already is good enough for your work. Maybe further evidence about the protonation at the terminal phosphate is important for you -- I don't know?

Energy Efficiency,"XCrysden, VESTA and even JMol all have variants of this format, and maybe a few other codes too, as the usefulness of this isn't restricted to solid-state applications. It's a very handy way to store and, through codes using the OB API, display vector fields, as well as vector quantities associated with points in a molecule, such as dipole moments, spin, force, displacement direction, eigenvectors of the charge density Hessian, etc.; I believe in XCrysDen, arbitrary points in space not associated with an atomic nucleus are given a dummy atom label. I have seen the same trick recommended for display of non-nucleus points in Avogadro (i.e. manually edit the included version of OB's atom types file to include Xa, Xb, Xc, Xd etc. types). Both recognised element symbols AND these dummy types could have, optionally, 3 extra columns in the atom record in the .xyz file. I see your point entirely about tensors (ordering convention).

I will have a look at how to use it for this. Would you recommend filling these data in moldenformat.cpp or completely separately (e.g. via language bindings)?. I am still wondering about what should happen in cases where the element symbol and the atomic number don't agree. I have a couple of molden files where this is the case because the atomic number is reduced by the number of cored electrons. So far, Open Babel uses the atomic number and disregards the element symbol, which caused converted geometries to have mostly wrong elements.

Energy Efficiency,"al charge"") is 1. This is what you need. ```; @<TRIPOS>UNITY_ATOM_ATTR; 4 1; charge 1; ```. 2. USCF dock scores support. This is equivalent to the SD tags in SDF/MOL files. A nice-to-have addon to support MOL2 files written by the DOCK program https://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/dock6_manual.htm. RDKit took a different approach. They infer the formal charges based on the atom types. How do they differentiate ions from radicals ? CH3+ vs CH3- vs CH3+ C.cat is indeed a SYBYL atom type, but there is no custom atom type for C-. Moreover, RDKit only supports CORINA atom typing scheme: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/3985.

Energy Efficiency,"canonical SMILES ok, but lost the stereochemistry on one of the two chiral centers when converted to InChI. If I read the connection table in the MolFile correctly, the two carbons in question are atom 2 (between the two oxygens, which are atoms 3 and 11) and atom 1 (methyl group); that bond appears to be explicitly specified as ""down"" chirality in the 2-1 bond row ('6'). For reference, the vendor-supplied SMILES string is C[C@@H]1OC[C@]2(CCN(C)C2)O1 while the OpenBabel canonical form is CN1CC[C@]2(CO[C@@H](C)O2)C1. The second problem is with a fused ring (not sure that's the correct terminology), molfile attached as OB02_FusedRing.mol. The molecule techincally has three chiral centers, but two of them may only have one R/L form sterically accessible (?). The molfile specifies chirality for all three. OB export to InChI results in loss of chirality information on all three centers ( InChI=1/C8H15NO/c1-9-6-2-3-7(9)5-8(10)4-6/h6-8,10H,2-5H2,1H3 ). OB export to canonical SMILES losses chirality on the hydroxyl. Working with the vendor supplied SMILES string ( CN1[C@@H]2CC[C@H]1C[C@@H](O)C2 ) as input instead of the molfile results in a chirality flip on the hydroxyl when output as canonical smiles ( O[C@@H]3C[C@H]4CC[C@@H](C3)N4C ), but proper chirality is conserved with InChI output ( InChI=1/C8H15NO/c1-9-6-2-3-7(9)5-8(10)4-6/h6-8,10H,2-5H2,1H3/t6-,7+,8+ ). It's a funky structure; it has a plane of symmetry through the hydroxyl, so I suppose it's a structural stereoisomer rather than specifically chiral, but I'm not sure given that the ring is constrained (? - would it be able to invert back-and-forth?). For that matter, I'm not sure that the stereochemistry describing the bonds to the nitrogen is totally sane in the molfile. I have other examples, but from scanning I found a few cases that I'm pretty certain are vendor-embedded differences (charge variation in a couple cases). Anyway if needed I can try to dredge up other examples.

Point c) can one the tools detect if the .xyz is ionic? No, by now I do not think so. The method `xyz2mol` can be ambiguous because the charge parameter i) is *the overall charge*, i.e. an amino acid with simultaneous presence of ammonium and carboxylate is seen as neutral. And ii) no error is reported if the same data set about the cation is processed with `-c -1`, i.e. ```shell; $ python ./xyz2mol_b.py KAXWOV_cation_xyz.xyz -c -1 > negative.sdf; $ obabel negative.sdf -O negative.bgf; 1 molecule converted; ```. ![negative](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/01e25457-b8ff-4426-a659-969820435ce1).

Energy Efficiency,"ned in the top right / top left ""biographic box"" (depending; if your script runs from left to right, or right to left). + With this dictionary in hand, check if your input SMILES structures; may be fully described by this reference. A potential pitfall is; how these amino acids are described in terms of a charge; (protonated / neuter amino group) in your reference SMILES about; individual amino acids / in the SMILES string. + Identify if / how OpenBabel / rdkit may linearly ""digest"" the; SMILES string, similar to reading the primary protein structure; about the consecution of amino acids only, and iteratively state; the single letter (FASTA) code. (A dictionary-based string; substitution would be more efficient and easier to maintain than; 20+ subsequent if-clauses.) This is based for on RDKit's; capability to identify structure pattern; Jan Jensen's beginner's; tutorial [1] showcases this for using Python in Jupyter notebook; about individual amino acids. I speculate OpenBabel is not competitive to folding algorithms; specifically designed to work on large proteins because the underlying; implementation of MMFF is a force field for / about small molecules; with a few degrees of freedom only. With what I retain from chem /; bio at grammar school, I equally assume one approach a protein folding; algorithm possibly probes is to start folding the protein right from; the moment when two amino acids form a dipeptide. To await the long; sequence to be synthesized completely and then to form the; secondary / tertiary / quaternary structure would be computationally; much more demanding (optimizing all degrees of freedom at once);; equally, proteins curl up right after leaving the ribosome / entering; the cytoplasm for a better state (energy wise). Stackexchange «matter modelling»,[2] while still in beta phase,; already allows to label questions with the tag «protein-folding», too.

Additionally, I just noticed that if I convert (with obabel) mol2 file to PDB file, optimize the geometries and calculate the partial charges with openmopac and convert (with obabel) the resulting PDB file (not MOO this time) to PDBQT-file, the charges are all total flat zero..",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2595#issuecomment-1596156455:1937,charge,charges,1937,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2595#issuecomment-1596156455,2,['charge'],['charges']
Energy Efficiency,"ttp://chemyang.ccnu.edu.cn/ccb/server/AIMMS/mol2.pdf Toolkits supporting the MOL2 file format took different approaches to add/guess missing information, such as the formal charge. In Open Babel, two additions were made with respect to the official MOL2. See: https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileFormats/Sybyl_Mol2_format.html?highlight=mol2. 1. Explicit declaration of the formal charges in the UNITY_ATOM_ATTR section (part of the official MOL2 specifications). No inference of the formal charge based on the atom types. Below, the atom number 4 has one custom attribute, namely its ""charge"" (Open Babel custom keyword for ""formal charge"") is 1. This is what you need. ```; @<TRIPOS>UNITY_ATOM_ATTR; 4 1; charge 1; ```. 2. USCF dock scores support. This is equivalent to the SD tags in SDF/MOL files. A nice-to-have addon to support MOL2 files written by the DOCK program https://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/dock6_manual.htm. RDKit took a different approach. They infer the formal charges based on the atom types. How do they differentiate ions from radicals ? CH3+ vs CH3- vs CH3+ C.cat is indeed a SYBYL atom type, but there is no custom atom type for C-. Moreover, RDKit only supports CORINA atom typing scheme: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/3985.

In a bash script,. ```bash; #!/usr/bin/bash. for file in *.mol; do; for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do; echo work on file ""$file"" level ""$i""; new_filename=""$i""_""$file"".xyz. obabel ""$file"" -h --gen3d ""$i"" -oxyz -O ""$new_filename""; done; done; ```; As an example, running `obabel case2.mol --gen3d -O case2_3d.mol` suggests unlikely catenanes . ![cases2_3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/173328419-ce836929-81f6-49d4-a367-7ef40c618b8a.png). ---. As a bypass to the problem, you might consider [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/). Launch the program from the CLI by `jmol case2.mol &`, or start the program by click and load the structure (File -> Open). . The program has its own command line interface (File -> Console), start this as second step. For addition of (idealized) hydrogens and subsequent optimization of the structure by the MMFF force field, enter `minimize addHydrogens;` after the prompt. (To run the optimization again, use a command in pattern of `minimize steps 1000;`.) When you are satisfied with the geometry suggested, either one of the following lines on Jmol's console yields a permanent record:. ```; write ""result.mol"";; write ""result.xyz"";; write ""result.png"";; ```. ![case2_Jmol_100iterations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/173328469-2f164aa0-2921-4f56-9638-5136ccf3d68f.png).

Integrability," Why are the docs not updated to warn prospective users of this at all? . This is getting ridiculous so let's try this one last time:. I have installed openbabel using the 32bit binary from [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases) on Windows 11. I have it in `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenBabel-3.1.1`. I have ensured that this dir is in my system path and user path variable:.

Speculation: the PLIB tool's file `requirements.txt` lists Open Babel (line 4, `openbabel~=3.0.0`), which might interfere here. It might be a library missing, or a conflict of ""which one to use"" e.g., if you have a system wide installation of OpenBabel, then partially overwritten by PLIB. My recommendation consists of. - to remove the current (local?) installation of Open Babel.; - if you reinstall Open Babel for general use on the computer (e.g., because of obgui), use the most recent version ([original source](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases)); - if you want to want to use Open Babel inside a Python project, use a virtual environment; isolated from the rest of Python libraries you have, an error in dependencies of the libraries were constrained to this compartment; - edit this (or any other) `requirements.txt` file. The current fetch of openbabel's Python bindings via pypi is known to be problematic; perhaps because it lists version 3.1.1.1 (four levels) on its [PyPi entry](https://pypi.org/project/openbabel/) instead of typical three (e.g., 3.1.1). Anyway, substitute the line of `openbabel` by `openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16` (as an example of application, see [here](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/fragments/blob/main/scripts/requirements.txt)) before running the usual `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to amend the local Python setup. [openbabel-wheel](https://pypi.org/project/openbabel-wheel/) aims to offer a temporary bypass; however, it requires the absence of any ""normal"" openbabel installation (within the virtual environement) to prevent confusion ""which version of library x to use"". It works reasonably well both in Windows, and Linux",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2677#issuecomment-1973548939:1342,depend,dependencies,1342,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2677#issuecomment-1973548939,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"### Hi tpfto,. - Have you looked at the error messages? The identical error message I assume you receive when running this command is also below. - Have you tried to generate canonical smiles also? I was having issues with my allenes when converting smiles->to canonical smiles, so that's how I got here. test:; ==============================; obabel -ismi -:""C(Cl)=[C@]=CF"" -ocan. output:; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in ParseSmiles; Ignoring stereochemistry. Not enough connections to this atom.; FC=C=CCl; 1 molecule converted. also: always good to check the documentation; https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileFormats/SMILES_format_using_Smiley_parser.html or here; https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/blob/master/src/formats/smiley.h. So, it is a smiles parser error. If I am not mistaken, the allene or cumulene stereochemistry is not well implemented in the obabel smiles parser/system, which means that when smiles are parsed, the allene stereochemistry label is lost before the coordinate generation and thus the result is not useful... This is based on these examples, not the documentation, because when reading the documentation and testing the example from the documentation... It also fails, even though there are as many differing substituents as there can be. test:; ==============================. obabel -ismi -:""NC(Br)=[C@@]=C(F)I"" -ocan. output:; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in ParseSmiles; Ignoring stereochemistry. Not enough connections to this atom.; NC(=C=C(I)F)Br; 1 molecule converted. I think this needs to be fixed, or the implementation reconsidered. I'm not sure if I get it but I would like that allene stereochemistry is recognized also if the determining centers are further away from the central atom, even though I am aware that this becomes computationally exhaustive rather quickly, but I think it this needs to be implemented, as allenic groups are not that rare and the resulting downstream ar",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1891#issuecomment-447419567:46,message,messages,46,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1891#issuecomment-447419567,2,['message'],"['message', 'messages']"

Integrability,", ostream* pos); {; if(pos) SetOutStream(pos, false);. if(!pOutFormat || !pOutput) return false;. SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-copy behavior when the API caller can promise that the molecule object won't be changed. I can look at this some more and improve the patch, but need feedback on which route to prioritize.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991:2167,rout,route,2167,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455228991,1,['rout'],['route']

The 'include' and 'directory' libraries aren't in the right place? How do i locate them? I have looked through the setup.py files which produce the error message 'SWIG failed....' and can't get my head around it?. Can you explain what your sudo line has fixed and therefore i may be able to do the same to mine. Thanks in advance!. >",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2408#issuecomment-1189168461:862,message,message,862,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2408#issuecomment-1189168461,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"> @fredrikw About this issue, I'm having another problem due to the unusual version (3.1.1.1).

The newer versions of Ubuntu (22.04, for example) and Arch/Manjaro, all of which compromise a fair amount of Linux users, use this path.

Integrability,"> If I grab a PDB file from RCSB, there are no explicit hydrogens:. It depends how the structure was generated. If it was determined with crystallography, there won't be any hydrogens because they can't be resolved from the electron density. If it's an NMR structure, it probably will include hydrogens. > How about this heuristic.. if the PDB file already has hydrogens, the default should be to assume all hydrogens are explicit?. That seems reasonable. Adding hydrogens to proteins needs to be done very carefully though. A lot of side chains are charged, so you don't want to just automatically fill in a hydrogen everywhere one could possibly go. And of course it depends on pH. Even if you assume you're only interested in pH 7, there still can be ambiguity. HIS has two forms that are equally common at pH 7, with the hydrogen on either ND1 or NE2. If one of the two is able to form a hydrogen bond, that stabilizes it, so you want to look at potential bonding partners to select which is more likely. In the example above, the file already has a hydrogen on CE1, and it adds a second one. That doesn't match any common form at any pH. So I guess there are three parts to the solution. 1. Provide an option for whether to add hydrogens.; 2. The default value for that option should depend on whether the file already has any hydrogens.; 3. Check the logic it uses for adding hydrogens, since there appear to currently be some cases where it creates unrealistic, nonphysical structures.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796:71,depend,depends,71,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796,3,['depend'],"['depend', 'depends']"

Integrability,"@RaphaelRobidas Contrasting to the mandatory Hill formula, the charge layer only is added to the InChI if the underlying structure is charged. The automatic charge recognition is embedded in the algorithm to yield the standard InChI. To best of my knowledge, this is not a parameter InChI trust's reference executables currently (version 1.6 by December 2021) offer to toggle off/relax as they do for the perception of stereochemistry. (And if engaged, this no longer yields the standard InChI `1S/...`, but one non-standard InChI `1/...`. Well, one .or. multiple options may be engaged simultaneously to yield *a* non-standard InChI; so *standard* is *agreed convention*.). On the other hand, there is ongoing development of InChI /per se/ as well as of applications engaging InChI.

Integrability,"@Ricardo The problem with all the SMILES strings around is that you; have to go far to recognize what type of SMILES string is offered to; you. In this perspective, I perceive OpenBabel as advantageous in; comparison to ChemDraw because with toggles like `-osmi` or `-ocan`; you may explicitly define which «dialect» the SMILES will be (e.g.,; canonical, universal, inchified). Like with any programs, as soon as you interface with other programs,; the lack of convention (or deployment of programs designed to adhere; different conventions), this may be anything in the spectrum of; «below the detection limit», «nuisance», and «incompatible».

Integrability,"@fredrikw About this issue, I'm having another problem due to the unusual version (3.1.1.1).; I want to use openbabel as a dependency of a Python package, and even though I install it using `conda`, it tries to upgrade the package when I install my package.; IMHO, bumping the version to `3.1.2` would be a good idea. Also, maybe `/usr/include/openbabel3` should be set as default in `setup.py`? The newer versions of Ubuntu (22.04, for example) and Arch/Manjaro, all of which compromise a fair amount of Linux users, use this path. If I use `--global-option` to use `-L` and `-I` I can install but I get the warnings:. ```bash; WARNING: Implying --no-binary=:all: due to the presence of --build-option / --global-option / --install-option. Consider using --config-settings for more flexibility.; DEPRECATION: --no-binary currently disables reading from the cache of locally built wheels.

Integrability,"@ghutchis Here are some more details regarding the testing I have been doing. I'm running the same smi-sdf-can roundtrip test from `test/testdistgeom.py` on a large dataset (eMolecules SMILES database, only considering chiral molecules). So far, **17670 molecules** have been processed **without any segfaults or wrong stereochemistry**. There is only a minor cosmetic issue which should be fixed I think. For some structures, the number of iterations in `OBDistanceGeometry` is not enough to generate a valid structure. This results in a warning message:; ```; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in AddConformer; Distance Geometry failed.; ```; The full roundtrip still produces the correct geometry since we now have an additional loop in Gen3D. However, seeing this message is confusing if the whole process actually worked. Ideally, `AddConformer()` would return a boolean to indicate success. This would change the API/ABI. Some possible workarounds:; 1. Increase the number of iterations (currently equal to the number of atoms).; 2. Add function and member variable (in `OBDistanceGeometryPrivate`) to silence this message.; 3. Remove message and add function to check succes/failure. For the 17670 molecules, there were only 7 such cases. These are listed below together with the number of times OBDistanceGeometry failed. ```; O\C=C1\CCCCC1=O 1 iteration failed; C[C@H]1CCC\C=C\[C@@H]2C[C@H](O)C[C@H]2[C@H](O)\C=C\C(=O)O1 5 iterations failed; Cl\C=C\Cl 1 iteration failed; CO[C@H]1[C@H](O)CC(=O)O[C@H](C)C\C=C\C=C\[C@H](OC2CCC(C(C)O2)N(C)C)[C@H](C)C[C@H](CC=O)[C@@H]1OC1OC(C)C(OC2CC(C)(O)C(O)C(C)O2)C(C1O)N(C)C 3 iterations failed; C\C1=C/CC(C)(C)\C=C\C\C(C)=C\CC1 1 iteration failed; CCO\C=C\CC 1 iteration failed; CO[C@H]1[C@@H](CC(=O)O[C@H](C)C\C=C\C=C\[C@H](O)[C@H](C)C[C@H](CC=O)[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(O)[C@@H](OC(=O)CC(C)C)[C@H](C)O2)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)N(C)C)OC(C)=O 5 iterations failed; ```; In any case, it might be a good idea to have a minim",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2158#issuecomment-610071981:547,message,message,547,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2158#issuecomment-610071981,2,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"@ignaspakamore Let me add two additional points; both are more comment-like:; + If you would like to have a recent compilation of the rules around .mol/.sdf (v3000) and elder .mol/.sdf(v2000), there is an archived .pdf of Biovia's documentation on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210219065450/https://discover.3ds.com/sites/default/files/2020-08/biovia_ctfileformats_2020.pdf). As far as I know, this is the most recent edition (August 2020). + As you mention crystal structures, on one hand, and mol files on the other, maybe the compiled set by [COD](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/index.php), named [cod-tools](https://wiki.crystallography.net/cod-tools/) is helpful for you. It includes `codcif2sdf`, an utility for the CLI to bring the .cif's structure model to the .mol/.sdf format. Often, if the cif2mol conversion by openbabel fails (e.g., ""completion"" of the structure based on the asymmetric unit), this one still finds a reasonable solution, especially for structure models of small organic molecules. Though conceived for the COD repository, thanks to the .cif standard, it equally processes .cif from other sources (publications' SI, CCDC from webCSD and conquest, etc.) Depending on the operating system, the collection equally may be available as a package easier to install, too ([example Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/cod-tools)). Though the tool (still) writes .sdf in the v2000 format, according to COD's maintainers, a new program is under construction which eventually is going to replace `codcif2sdf`. It were plausible that this one then will write .sdf (v3000).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2550#issuecomment-1323247057:1200,Depend,Depending,1200,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2550#issuecomment-1323247057,1,['Depend'],['Depending']

Integrability,"All I can say is that's right, and I've been aware for some time. AFAIK, obErrorLog is the only instance of an object in the OpenBabel library, and presumably there's something about instances that doesn't translate well in the SWIG paradigm (it only handles classes). I guess if a C++ method were added in the interface file called getOBErrorLog() all would be well? Maybe this is the 'correct' OO way of handling these things anyway (don't quote me).

Integrability,"As a comment, because it does not aim to solve the issue for Open Babel:. File `example_bad.cif` contains a syntax error because of the missing closing `'`. Note, from the perspective of the syntax of a `.cif` file, there is no need to enclose each of the symmetry equivalent positions by a `'`. However, if you choose to use an opening `'`, you need a closing `'`, too. You may submit any `.cif` to an checker like [checkcif](https://checkcif.iucr.org/) -- doing so for this file (here you need to choose option `Validation of CIF only (no structure factors)`) will both identify the problem as well as its location (line 36). Side notes:; - The _original_ `.cif` from the COD ([card #1011063](http://crystallography.net/cod/1011063.html)) does not use the single quotation marks and a conversion with obabel (3.1.0) works just fine. The same for its sibling entry, [COD 1011024](http://crystallography.net/cod/1011024.html) about ice III.; - One of the references of the `.cif` syntax is IUCr's dedicated [web site](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/spec/version1.1/cifsyntax).; - Assuming `example_bad.cif` is the result of an (automated ?) edit of a `.cif` from a database like the [COD](http://crystallography.net/cod/index.php): the checkcif service relies in large part on [Platon](https://www.platonsoft.nl/platon/) and its [validation routines](https://www.platonsoft.nl/platon/pl000601.html). It is possible to install Platon locally, and subsequently perform the checks on a batch of `.cif` files, too.; - Consider updates.

Integrability,"Confirmed. The two SMILES strings can be interconverted by swapping the order of two substituents (the amine and the amide) while changing the @ to @@, and thus they are identical (remember that swapping substituents inverts chirality). The error appears to be introduced in writing the CAN smiles string. The Clockwise or Anticlockwiseness in the original SMILES string should have been converted to an absolute configuration, and then converted back to Clockwise or Anticlockwise in the CAN smiles. Simply retaining the @ or @@ is incorrect as it is dependent on the order of substituents which is different. - Noel.

Integrability,"Dear Sir,; Thank you very much for answering and helping me. ; recently, several chemoinformatic tools has been developed to either cluster existing reactions using molecular fingerprint and machinery learning techniques, or produce new reactions for a set of molecules using the concept of generalized reaction rules. these methods are dependant on molecular fingerprints or mol files. as far as I know, the concept of aromaticity is only available in canonical SMILES structure not in molecular fingerprint or mol file. so when we convert an aromatic SMILES to these kind of molecular descriptor, we only consider one tautomer out of all possible structures. that is why I was looking for a function to produce all valence tautomers. I could generate kekule forms by writing the following c++ function:. pair<string,string> getKekulizedSmiles(const vector<string>& newVector, int i); {; string canSmiles;; string kekSmiles;; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; canSmiles = newVector[i];; if (! conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""smi"")); {; cout<<""Formats not available\n"";; }; conv.ReadString(&mol,canSmiles);; conv.SetOptions(""xC"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; conv.SetOptions(""xk"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; kekSmiles = conv.WriteString(&mol, true);; return {canSmiles, kekSmiles};; }. though, I still don't know what does '-xk' do. :)).

Integrability,"Each time one wants to report an issue about openbabel here on GitHub, the interface provides you with a template. This is to help you to organize your observation(s), and others to identify the possible cause; typically leading to an improvement how the program is used or/and an improvement of the program. You still can edit your question with the bits and bolts the template provides; perhaps especially to organize a report in sections (initiated by a head line following the `##`):. ```; ## Environment Information; Open Babel version:; Operating system and version:. ## Expected Behavior; <!-- Describe the intended output or what you expected to see. -->. ## Actual Behavior; <!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; ```. In addition, the interface allows to discern running text on one hand, from snippets of code / output back to the CLI on the other hand by markup as a code block: add three backticks in a line prior, and three backticks in a line following the section. Do not confuse backticks with single quotes. Because some characters might have a particular meaning to (GitHub flavored) [markdown syntax](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) used here, it equally is *safer* to enclose SMILES and SMARTS in backticks, too. This equally eases to copy-paste them from here to a local instance of running openbabel.

Integrability,"First, all the credit for the conda binary goes to @rwest and @connie (discussion [here](https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/pull/310)). All I did was run a more recent git commit through their build script. There's a note [hidden on binstar](https://anaconda.org/patrickfuller/openbabel):. > Tested on Python 2 and 3, Mac and Ubuntu. Requires adding asmeurer and rwest to your ~/.condarc channels. These channels allow the installer to grab the `pkg-config` and `cairo` dependencies. @rwest had to patch directly into openbabel's source to resolve certain dependency paths (the goal was to have _all_ dependencies managed through conda). If you don't use their channels for pulling dependencies, the links are going to be incorrect. For replication's sake, my `~/.condarc` is:. ```; channels:; - defaults; - asmeurer; - rwest; - rmg; - patrickfuller; ```. The binary should work. If it doesn't, my pre-conda workflow used a whole lot of `install_name_tool` commands. ```; install_name_tool -change libpython3.4m.dylib ~/miniconda3/lib/libpython3.4m.dylib ~/miniconda3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/_openbabel.so; for l in xmlformat pubchem cmlreactformat cmlformat cdxmlformat; do install_name_tool -change libxml2.2.dylib ~/miniconda3/lib/libxml2.dylib ~/miniconda3/lib/openbabel/2.3.90/$l.so; done; ```.

Integrability,"Hi @NooraAz. The problem was caused by missing ""ROOT"" and ""ENDROOT"" which are structural keywords in ligand PDBQT files for Vina. ; `-r` converts the molecule to a rigid receptor PDBQT. Your ligand is indeed fully rigid without undergoing ring breaking, but it has to have ""ROOT"" and ""ENDROOT"" to represent the ""tree structure"" of a ligand. . There are various options to prepare ligand PDBQT for Vina:; Obabel; `obabel -i pdb hexaA-result_106399.pdb -o pdbqt`; The residue names might change, but it's not harmful to the docking calculation. You can explore better ways of doing this within the version that's available to you, just don't use `-r`. . Geometry-based Approach; **prepare_ligand** in https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/documentation/; The residue names can be preserved. . Valence-based Approach with Interface to RDKit; https://github.com/forlilab/Meeko?tab=readme-ov-file#1-make-pdbqt-files; See if you'd be interested to register your ligand as a RDKit molecule along with the ligand preparation.

Integrability,"Hi @nbehrnd, thanks for taking such a deep dive into this. Actually I am working specifically on PLIP and 3lcs.pdb is only an example file I am currently using for testing. . I am looking into some issues regarding protonation - PLIP currently calls `AddPolarHydrogens()`.; I thought this was the Python Interface equivalent to the command line version with `-h`, actually it is probably the equivalent of `--addpolarh`. So yes, I am indeed only interested in polar hydrogens. However, I am getting a hydrogen atom added to one of the oxygens in glutamic acids side chain which I don't think should be there in physiological conditions. I was experimenting with using `AddHydrogens(True, True, 7.4)` instead to get polar hydrogens for a specific pH value. I thought this would be the Python interface equivalent of `-p`. Turns out, while using it via the Python interface messes up the file in a similar manner, the command line option in contrast to the Python interface option still leaves me with that unwanted hydrogen in glutamic acid's side chain. No idea how that happens...

Integrability,"Hi there!. I don't think it's so much a question on errors in the search routines, more a problem with how the searches in FastSearch files are working and the query smiles. The problem is that in SMILES/SMARTS C and c are different atoms, so they won't match. When using SMARTS, a possible way to solve this is to use [#6] instead of C and [#7] instead of N, so that the first Query would be [#6]c2ccc1ncc([#6])c([#7])c1c2. This would probably give the expected match if used like (untested); babel -s""[#6]c2ccc1ncc([#6])c([#7])c1c2"" example-1.sdf -osmi; The same is true for the second example. The ""unexpected"" hits in example 3 are due to the aromaticity detection. If you look at your query you haven't said anything on where the different bonds are located, only the atoms and that match all your hits.; Unfortunately, when using FastSearch files, you can't use SMARTS-based queries, the query needs to be proper SMILES and then I don't know how you could specify your queries to get the wanted result.

Integrability,"Hi,. A short question/remark. The round-tripped SMILES is missing stereochemistry on the nitrogens as you noted. It seems that Jan put some efforts into having the stereo on the nitrogens so it might be advisable to keep that if you are trying to use his protocol? Otherwise, you could loop through the atoms and remove stereo from any nitrogens in your python code.

Integrability,"Hi,. I am not familiar enough with CML spec to reply to your question. See below for more explanations. I am doing molecular simulations with empirical force fields (e.g. OPLSAA or other). In order to do a molecular simulation, I must assign a force field type to each atom in a molecule. Recently, I decided to use the AtomClass number as a force field type. I found that CML is the only output format that use the AtomClass number but I would like to output this information directly in tinker xyz file (instead of MM2 force field). My work flow for a molecular simulation is then: create a SMILE code for molecules including AtomClass number (or equivalently force field type), use obabel to output a tinker xyz file (with coordinates and connectivity informations) and a cml file (with force field information) from which as script creates input files for my molecular dynamics code…. This is just a second-choice route! Ideally, I would like obabel to do atom typing (associate force field to atoms from element names and connectivity using rules) just like aten does using NETA langage.

Integrability,"I also see only 2 molecules converted on 32bit Windows (with the development code). But the problem is data dependent and intermittent. Apparently irrelevant changes during debugging can make the problem go away and the read position in the input file apparently moves erratically. So an over-writing or alignment problem looks probable. The header is binary but its interpretation in C++ makes assumptions about how a C++ struct is laid out - clearly not a good idea. I have in the past written a version with the header in ASCII but did not proceed because correcting another bug seemed to solve the problem. . It seems likely that the bug is a more general I/O on the header and not confined to 64bit systems. I'll try revising the header reading and writing code. In the longer term I would like fastsearch files to be portable binary in Andrew Dalke's FPB format, if it ever comes to fruition.

Integrability,"I think I understand your concern: reading the listed atoms, you want to see at one glance which hydrogen atom is bond to which of the set (C,N,O,P,S). As far as I know, OpenBabel is not capable to do this for you. In small molecule crystallography -- and your ligand, if crystallized once, may fit into this category -- _typically_ the non-hydrogen atoms are identified first. Completing the structure solution, hydrogens are taken into consideration, too. Depending on the programs used (maybe [ShelX](https://shelx.uni-goettingen.de/) and [Olex2](https://www.olexsys.org/olex2/) are staples for you), and the quality of the experimental data available, this may be easy, because there are templates to start with. E.g., for a methyl group around a (sp^3) carbon, the program knows that three hydrogens in this tetrahedral arrangement at a certain (temperature dependent) distance to C usually is a good _initial_ guess. And hence labels these hydrogens bound to `C1` as `H1A`, `H1B`, `H1C`, too. This automatism to add hydrogens _and_ to label them according to their rooting atom _apparently_ is not / yet (completely) included by OpenBabel; worth a feature request. This suggest of the three hydrogens, as well as their labels is a mere _optional suggestion_ by the program to the user. S/He may decide to attribute experimental data to the hydrogens without this help, s/he may decide to label these as `H1`, `H52`, `H365`, too; the model is not better, or worse because of this, only less accessible to the next user deposit in the .cif format. As shown in the example attached below, even if these labels _initially_ were organized well, the direct conversion `obabel -icif example.cif -opdb -O example.pdb` may render this attribution invisible. A light-weight alternative thus may be, as shown, to read the initial .cif by Jmol, to write by Jmol an intermediate .pdb and to convert this file by OpenBabel into an eventually complete .pdb with header and detailed label information.

Integrability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1189615; Originator: NO. The reasoning, seen easiest with a single atom C fragment, was that almost every molecule would have this matched, given that the main use of this type of fingerprint is to index large >10000 databases of organic molecules. It would be unlikely that any body would depend on the single atom N fragment, in the way they would for say As. Rather, they would specify a N-containing group which would have larger distinguishing fragments. These bits would not contribute significantly to distinguishing between molecules and so should be omitted. . However, the gain from doing so is not much. So if the difference from Daylight's product is confusing maybe we should change it. Chris.

The strdup() function allocates sufficient memory for a copy of the string str, does the copy, and returns a pointer to it.

I'm currently suspecting the MinGW compiler 3.4.2 I use to be the reason (which has at least one problem with optimizations switched on), so I would like to have this bug reopened until I can verify this.

Integrability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1444119; Originator: NO. This is a bug in the canonicalizer. The canonicalizer figures out the symmetry groups of the atoms without taking chirality into account, so any time there are two atoms that are identical except for their chirality, you'll get two possible ""canonical"" SMILES. Another instance of this is documented in the code, where a cis/trans configuration is incorrectly analyzed because, without taking chirality into account, it appears to be symmetrical and hence not cis or trans. In this case there is an axis of symmetry through a ring, and the only difference in the two halves of the ring are the two chiral centers themselves. So when the canonical-SMILES tree-generator reaches the ring, it has a choice between going left or right, and both paths appear identical, so it can generate two different canonical SMILES. The canonicalizer needs to add chirality to the atom-invarients *before* it starts analyzing chirality. However, even this is tricky, because sometimes a center can be chiral or achiral depending on the chirality of *other* atoms, leading to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem. Maybe a two-pass symmetry analysis is needed: First without chirality, then add in the chirality as new atom-invarients when a tie between two chiral atoms is discovered, and re-do the symmetry analysis.

Since the conversion is done this is not really a problem, just that it's not very elegant ;-).

Integrability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: YES. Yes, this is definitely a workaround. In fact we do completely agree :). That OpenBabel parses files in a locale-dependent way, is clearly an OpenBabel bug, which needs to be fixed there. The C library (sscanf) apparently always honor the locale. So any code using it must be changed to use the C++ library (ifstream...) and call .imbue() on the stream to tell it to assume LC_NUMERIC=C. A while ago part of this was fixed in OpenBabel but last time I checked many places (probably in file format plugins...) still had to be ported.

Otherwise, it prints a warning message saying ""It looks like you don't have the Boost headers so the following formats will not be compiled: chemdrawcdx, etc.. This is probably because you are using GCC3.x and don't have Boost installed. For more information, see http://openbabel.sf.net/Install (Source Code)"". (3) If HAS_BOOSTLIKE_HEADERS is not defined, don't compile any format that relies on the existence of Boost-like headers. (4) Update the documentation appropriately. I will do 4, and I can test 1-->3. (By the way, I note that although ./configure --includedir=whatever correctly sets includedir in the Makefile, the value of includedir does not seem to be incorporated into $INCLUDES.). Noel.

Integrability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: NO. This fix has the effect of reducing the functionality of the bindings - I would say it makes them unusable. As an example illustrating the general problem, OBConversion is in obconversion.py, whereas the templates are in obtemplate.py. This means that any methods of OBConversion returning a std::vector will be unusable in Python, e.g.:. >>> obconv = ob.obconversion.OBConversion(); >>> obconv.GetSupportedInputFormat(); <Swig Object of type 'std::vector<std::string > *' at 0x8166a90>. Of course this can be trivially fixed by copying that template to obconversion.py. However, the problem is more general as it also applies to every method that returns a C++ object. An alternative suggestion is to find out (from the SWIG mailing list) whether most of the std::vector template verbiage can be suppressed (e.g. by editing std_vector.i). That is, when wrapping a std::vector all that's needed is the length and the ability to index it (or so) - there's no need for append and pop methods and so on.

Integrability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. Accessing GetVector() is fine. It appears to be properly wrapped. Accessing x() causes the segfault. I've just looked at the C++ code.

I think that the solution is make either vector3::Get() or vector3::operator[] work from the scripting languages, as these are really the correct way to access the data in C++.

Integrability,"May you please clarify what represents for you a «3D builder»?. *Assuming* this refers to a program to set up a computation in a program like Gaussian, Gamess-UK, Games-US, etc. the state of a molecule as radical is described by the spin of the molecule, independent to assigning the molecule as neutral, or charged. As an example, [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) may either read a normal closed-shell molecule (like methane) from a `.mol` or `.sdf` or one may build one from which e.g., hydrogens are removed. With optional extensions you may then export this as as starting point for quantum chemistry calculations as illustrated below:*. ![example_avogadro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554375-3077e7f3-932e-40dc-b8b7-cc81995097c0.gif). Some assignments of charges and multiplicities for CH3 above only serve as illustration that it can be set up yet it shows that you can discern between e.g., methyl cation, methyl carbanion, and methy radical. In this perspective, Avogadro trades similar to interfaces like [gabedit](http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/). ![gabedit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554505-6e69ed1e-432b-4771-9996-c4bf568f104d.png).

Integrability,"Maybe something with the SMILES you process is wrong, which could be accidental (e.g., manual entry to a database), or systematic (a computer program generates the molecules/SMILES). Especially if it is for the later, it would be worth to identify the SMILES currently causing the problem in first place before engaging the generation of 2D or 3D structure for a .mol file. It is possible to run the program with SMILES as input as well as output format, e.g., by -ocan. Since SMILES of one (more complex) structure may differ depending on the algorithm/implementation used (e.g., universal, inchified, canonical SMILES in OpenBabel), this often is a good first (or zeroth) step when working with SMILES from different sources/databases anyway. To retain the problematic SMILES, it then might be a question of reading out the error stream, or a try-escape clause (in Python) to check if it is an error in SMILES syntax causing OpenBabel's message. If the molecule in question contains a great number of bonds which -- in principle -- are flexible to rotation, the conversion SMILES -> 3D structure may take substantially more time, than for rigid molecules (note that --gen3d only is one of five levels to guess a conformer, see the manual) though the syntax of the SMILES is a correct one. If you only want one conformer to start with, and not need the of lowest energy (OpenBabel equally offers a systematic conformer search), the two-step SMILES -> 2D (--gen2d) into a .mol, and subsequent 2D mol -> 3D mol (with --gen3d) sometimes is faster (this assumes you have a valid SMILES in first place).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2530#issuecomment-1229902870:527,depend,depending,527,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2530#issuecomment-1229902870,2,"['depend', 'message']","['depending', 'message']"

Access to the functionality already part of OBMol could be realized via wrapper methods in the new class. That way, the current API remains fully intact while avoiding an arbitrary separation of functionality. One might add a ""warning"" (possibly in comment-form) to the manipulation methods that are currently part of OBMol to tell the users not to use them anymore if it can be avoided. Obviously, whether or not to introduce such a warning is not for me to decide.

Integrability,"On the list, Craig said:; ""This is OpenBabel's other main flaw (the first one being the handling of chirality, which is currently under revision). Here is a repeat of a message I sent to this list on 3/21/2006. ---------------------. Chris and Geoff,. I'm having a devil of a time with hydrogens, and it all seems to boil down to the lack of documentation in the original OpenBabel code. It appears that the notions of ""implicit hydrogens"" and ""implicit valence"" aren't documented, and it seems to be used to mean different things depending on who was writing code, where the molecule came from, and where it's going. * In some cases, the number of hydrogens is assumed to be the ImplicitHydrogen count (regardless of whether there are other explicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888:169,message,message,169,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/867#issuecomment-281794888,2,"['depend', 'message']","['depending', 'message']"

Crystallographers however are grateful to know about the outcome of such experiments in advance, and to subsequently check multiple different crystallographic models accordingly (e.g., Hamilton *R*-factor ratio test). Obviously, it is not good to describe all structures in *P1*, either. You may find at least one *similar* model of tetragonal space group symmetry in the [COD](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/index.php) (e.g., entry [9000071](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/9000071.html)) without doubled *c* axis, too. Depending on the question addressed to the database, the search masks by [COD](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/search.html) and by Volodymyr Vreshch on [crystallography.io](https://crystallography.io/) partially overlap and complement each other.

Integrability,"Point a) I would describe this task as ""extend what obabel already can do""; Point b) I'm not aware if RDKit offers an interface to Materials Studio / .bgf files. The suggest to use multiple tools (the .sdf reconstruction with xyz2mol/RDKit, the preparation of .bgf with obabel) might be unfortunate for splitting the attention on two tools instead of one for the overall .xyz -> .bgf task ahead, but I presume the preparation of .bgf has to run only once and hence ""acceptable"". Point c) can one the tools detect if the .xyz is ionic? No, by now I do not think so. The method `xyz2mol` can be ambiguous because the charge parameter i) is *the overall charge*, i.e. an amino acid with simultaneous presence of ammonium and carboxylate is seen as neutral. And ii) no error is reported if the same data set about the cation is processed with `-c -1`, i.e. ```shell; $ python ./xyz2mol_b.py KAXWOV_cation_xyz.xyz -c -1 > negative.sdf; $ obabel negative.sdf -O negative.bgf; 1 molecule converted; ```. ![negative](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/01e25457-b8ff-4426-a659-969820435ce1). The earlier Python script above however can be edited; molecules which (overall) don't carry a charge are rewritten as .sdf obabel can process. Structure files which might carry a charge in *excess* will be left untouched and there will be a note about them back to the CLI. The prototype script below allows both the sequential / use-1-CPU-only mode as well as one to spread the work of xyz2mol all CPU available. ```python; #!/usr/bin/env python3; """"""; name : filter.py; author : nbehrnd@yahoo.com; license: GPL2; date : 2024-05-03; edit :; purpose: perform xyz2mol on over all neutral molecules, inform abou the other; """""". import argparse; from multiprocessing import Pool # engage multiple CPU (Python standard library). import rdkit; from rdkit import Chem; from rdkit.Chem import rdDetermineBonds. def get_args():; """"""Get command-line arguments"""""". parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(; descrip",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2691#issuecomment-2093386462:118,interface,interface,118,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2691#issuecomment-2093386462,1,['interface'],['interface']

I am just baffled by the fact that OpenBabel turns an Alanine (small hydrophobic sidechain of single methyl group) into an Arginine (positive charge, large sidechain with guanidino group). Those residues couldn't be further in apart from eachother. Where is the code that determines the residue name when reading in a PDB formatted file? It should read ALA as alanine not arginine. This is what I am referring to being wrong:. ```python; from openbabel import openbabel. obConversion = openbabel.OBConversion(); obConversion.SetInFormat('pdb'); obConversion.ReadFile(pdbmol,""4GQ6.pdb""). ## WRONG residue name! This is an alanine ALA not an ARG (arginine).

Integrability,"Reference emails:. ```; Hi there,. I'm using the Python interface to OpenBabel to create 2D representations of my molecules. I'm having a great time except when it decides to draw extra hydrogens. I'm quite sure these hydrogens are not supposed to be drawn. In the attached image, the ""CH"" on carbon monoxide is not numbered; I think this means it's not explicitly represented in the OBMol object, but the SVG writer decides to draw it anyway. In the SVG file, the text comes out as ""CH"" in a single element. I've tried almost all combinations of add/delete, implicit/explicit hydrogens in the input and output options. If I set {""C"":True} in write(), it won't draw the ""CH"" on carbon monoxide - in fact it doesn't draw any atoms to the right of the triple bond, but I do want it to draw ""C"". I could just edit the .svg file manually, but that's probably not the best solution. Generally speaking, all I want is for OpenBabel to draw exactly the same atoms that I gave it! :). In [1]: import pybel; In [2]: mol = pybel.readfile('can', 'can.txt', opt={""h"":True}) ; In [3]: mol.next().write(""svg"", ""can.svg"", opt={""a"":True,""P"":600,""i"":True}, overwrite=True). Thanks,. - Lee-Ping; ```. ```; The H atoms are drawn intentionally. See the docs for the 'a' option:; a draw all carbon atoms; So propane would display as H3C-CH2-CH3. What you want is an additional option that draws the C's but not the H's. I don't have time now to do development, but it should be pretty easy to see where option 'a' is in the C++ code and add a new option to do as you suggest. Perhaps you, or someone else reading this, would like to try this. - Noel; ```. ```; Hi there,. I think I got it to work! I added a “capital X” option to the SVG output format, which sets the “allExplicit” option in OBDepict. This option makes OBDepict ignore the implicit hydrogen count on atoms, so it only draws atoms that explicitly there. Examples attached.

Integrability,"Regarding integration into OB (or any other open source project) t's usual to discuss planned large changes before the work is started so as to receive feedback and address concerns or consider alternatives. In particular, modifications to core classes are considered carefully. Creating a new canonical nomenclature is a very interesting project though, and impressive as an end of degree project.

Integrability,"Seriously, I'm not sure why anyone would want to do that. Why would you want to re-parse the same string repeatedly?. But what you're doing later is just bad code. You're parsing a molecule that Python probably treats as a temporary. Then you grab an atom reference. That's still probably a temporary. Then you put that into a list. Then *after* putting all those atom references in a list, you interrogate them? I'm not surprised it leads to weird behavior. Python (and the SWIG interface) can't determine whether the temporary can be free, so it probably frees some of them. Now you're asking for valence on some undefined C++ pointer.

The algorithm you implemented gives you the same performance O(N*logN). N you have when goes through all the atoms and logN - when insert item into std::set. The weak point is hash. To create it and after to compare. The best thing, IMHO, is to make the class in paragraph 1) which will be very fast (3 double comparison and one string).

Integrability,"The OpenSMILES spec at http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html#hydrogens says ""Question: are more than 9 hydrogens possible? Should they be supported?"".

[ZnH9][H] fall under none of these three exceptions. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that Weininger didn't think [*H10] would occur, rather than be definitive about avoiding more than one digit. FWIW, the spec and online documentation also say that there's at most one digit of charge, but [some years back](https://sourceforge.net/p/blueobelisk/mailman/message/29130183/) I pointed out the Daylight toolkit accepted even [C+65535] (which it interpreted as [C-]) - that is, just like the CEX example Noel pointed to, Daylight's code accepted a broader range of chemistry than Weininger (1988) or the online documentation.

Integrability,"The following can only cover some parts. Inferring from Linux Debian, Linux CentOS provides *some basic* support of Python; mainly to support the operating system itself. And if you perform a proper update of the operating system, then equally these supporting libraries are going to be updated. Now to your project. There is a set of modules deemed essential to Python; they constitute the Python standard library *every* Python installation includes, for instance `os`, `sys`, `argparse`. See for instance [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html). Additional functionality can be imported by additional libraries. One way to manage these *new dependencies* is by a `requirements.txt` file to list these modules -- preferably with indication of their (minimal) version known to work. For example. ```; CairoSVG>=2.7.1; openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16; rdkit>=2023.3.2; Requests>=2.31.0; ```. To keep the Python libraries which support your operating system in good shape, it is considered good practice to keep them separate (not accidentally modified) from packages used to develop and experiment with new packages. This is the background of using *virtual environments* which you. - first create, i.e. set up of a minimal clean Python environment; - second activate, i.e. to start using them; - third complement by additional Python packages (if needed) to provide additional functionality. *Here* the special file `requirements.txt` helps you because . ```shell; pip install -r ./requirements.txt; ```. is going to resolve the dependencies for you automatically. In case *virtual environments* is a concept new to you, Python documents it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Real Python offers a free [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) less technical if you prefer so. In each case: note that the commands in Windows, Linux, MacOS to toggle on/off the virtual environment differ ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034:716,depend,dependencies,716,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"The perception/assignment of bond orders for the xzy2mol conversion likely is based on geometry and distances (see, e.g. southern pyrrole in comparison with the three other ones in your illustration). Possibly other routines do so, too. The one e.g., by the Jensen group, [xyz2mol](https://github.com/jensengroup/xyz2mol), which by 2018 was written for «molecules containing the following elements: H, B, C-F, Si-Cl, Br, and I.» ([blog post](https://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/2018/01/xyz2mol-converting-xyz-file-to-rdkit.html)). Jensen provided additional insight about its function in his talk at RDKit UGM 2020 (3:21 mm:ss onward, [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD6IpXMVKeo)). You may edit the connection table in the .mol file manually (below the atomic coordinates); here, atoms are listed (integers by appearance in the model, count starts with 1) as well as the assigned bond order. For a molecule (still) this small, you may consider a visual edit, e.g., in [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)'s model kit as well, and save the newly written model in a separate file.

Integrability,"There are two approaches identified to address the issue. The first one will process the data with intermediate files you may check and use elsewhere. The second one relays the result of one step into the next one as input via pipes; aside of the very input file, there will be only one permanent record of the output. + approach a, step by step:. ``` shell; obabel small_mol_example.pdbqt -O without_hydrogens.pdb ; obabel without_hydrogens.pdb -h -O with_hydrogens.pdb; obabel with_hydrogens.pdb -xh -O with_hydrogens.pdbqt; ```. Note, the addition of hydrogens (`-h`, second step) is *a parameter*. The preservation of hydrogens (`-xh`, third step) is an *output option* to affect the format of the result already computed; this is similar to e.g., `-xc 8` for the generation of a .svg to display multiple molecules at once, but with an explicit, user defined constraint to write a table of 8 columns. + approach b, use of pipes. If your operating system allows to concatenate multiple instructions (e.g., Linux Debian), the result of one processing may be the input of the next. E.g.,. ``` bash; obabel small_mol_example.pdbqt -opdb | obabel -ipdb -h -opdb | obabel -ipdb -xh -O one_step_with_hydrogens.pdbqt; ```. Either one of the two routes proceeds smoothly (obabel 3.1.1, Linux Debian 12). In the display of e.g., Jmol, the addition of hydrogens appears plausible. Out of caution, I recommend to check if the indazole is the correct one; perhaps you have additional evidence for this, or its isomer. In the .zip attached below, I copy the results written by obabel, and visualizations by Jmol (14.32.79, 2022-10-26 15:52) reading the saturated .pdb and .pdbqt.

Integrability,"There are two separate problems here:. 1) The external build scripts for the Perl and Python bindings assume that libopenbabel will be in lib/, and they can't handle it if the library is instead in lib64/. CMake will put it in lib64/ if you tell it -DLIB_SUFFIX=64, which is the appropriate thing to do on a multilib system. . 2) The CMake build instructions for the Ruby bindings pass ""--with-openbabel-lib=${BABEL_LIBRARY}"" whereas what is wanted is ""--with-openbabel-lib=${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}"". That is, the library name is passed instead of the library directory. The latter is particularly insidious. If there is a pre-existing libopenbabel in the linker's library search path then the ${BABEL_LIBRARY} version will find and link against that, thus (a) masking the error, and (b) possibly recording the wrong soname as a dependency of the Ruby bindings. I can provide patches for both of these, but I don't seem to be able to attach files, and they would be mangled if I included them in-line. E-mail me if you want them.

Integrability,"This is a DDL2 dictionary tag ; (symcif: http://oldwww.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/cifdic_html/2/cif_sym.dic/index.html), which current OB code does not fully support. As Geoff said that tag is not supposed to be computer-readable, so the supplied CIF files are actually incomplete. But the ""_space_group.transform_*"" tags which should be used instead are not handled by openbabel right now (reading them is one thing, but the spacegroup routines would have to take those into account). It would be so much simpler if the files always included the unique Hall symbol, ot the list of transforms... All this being said, the list in spacegroup.txt does include all the origin choices 1 and 2 (e.g. ""P 4/n m m:1"" and ""P 4/n m m:2""). So I have now added a hack in cifformat.cpp, so that when a HM symbol is found an the _space_group.IT_coordinate_system_code is equal to '1' or '2', the HM symbol is appended with ':1' or ':2', which is then correctly interpreted by the spacegroup routines. This is available in SVN head. Since :1 and :2 probably are the most common cases for this tag, this should be helpful. Other values for this tag will generate an appropriate warning.

Integrability,"This is a bug when babel is used on the command-line . The sizing of the table works ok in the GUI and with the alternative command-line interface obabel (see the example below). The development code now has a fix for babel, but it requires the use of --rows and --cols instead of xr and -xc (and --px instead of -xp). With babel the options are shared with other formats, which causes conflicts when they take different numbers of parameters (as here). obabel is more flexible because it does not need to be told the number of parameters. This, and its greater protection against mistakingly overwriting input files, make it the command-line interface of choice. .

Integrability,"This was a ""feature"" when it was deliberately introduced about six years ago. I'm not sure that it is so dangerous that it needs over-hasty reaction just before a release. To have input and output files the same:; - on the command line, you have deliberately typed the same file name twice.; - on the GUI you have been warned when you entered the output file name.; - in a program or a script, and the names are not explicit, maybe the program should be more carefully constructed to avoid unwanted overwriting. There are legitimate uses for having the input and output files the same. Suppose you wanted to add a new molecule from a mol file to an existing cml file. obabel thecmlfile.cml extra.mol -O thecmlfile.cml. does this very nicely, without the tedious file deletion and renaming that would be necessary if you couldn't have the output and input the same. Editors of all kinds routinely read and write to the same file. OB is an editor sometimes: make the hydrogens explicit:. obabel file.mol -O file.mol -h. The command-line is not set up for interactivity; it has be an acceptance or a prohibition. I would favour acceptance. Chris.

Integrability,"To qualify as a `.cif` (smaller molecules) or a `.mmcif` file (for larger protein/DNA/RNA models), the file should equally contain information about the symmetries present in the unit cell, as well as about the three vectors defining the parallelepiped (i.e., cell lengths a, b, c and the enclosed angles \alpha, \beta, \gamma). Depending on the symmetry met, some of these values may be equal (e.g., cubic Bravais class). Your file seems to miss them. Because the data set seems to be the result of a simulation, do you have the option for an output in a different file format? Given the chemistry (size of the model .and. that there are so many amino acids around), `.pdb` likely would be available, too. Speaking of small molecule data (e.g., `.cif` from the COD like [this one](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/2005645.html)), the archive attached below provides an example converting a single entry. There, once a `.sdf` is in hand (with all molecules _in one model_) the `--separate` flag converts them into _multiple models_ one `.sdf` container. Later, these are split into individual `.sdf` files with `-m`:. ```bash; obabel transformation.sdf -O separate_models.sdf --separate --unique; obabel separate_models.sdf -O single.sdf -m; ```; (Note: use `--unique` with what you intend in subsequent processing in mind.).

Could you make that fix instead here - this should presumably also make the error message go away. Regarding the original problem, using temporary files in Python is not as straightforward as the OP might think; there are various ways this can go wrong. I would focus on whether the original code works without reference to temporary files, i.e. if you just create a file, write to it and close it.

Integrability,"We won't be changing our own Add/RemoveHydrogens to do this. The functionality you describe is outside the scope of Add/RemoveHydrogens() in a general purpose cheminformatics library. However, the required functionality can easily be implemented client-side by providing wrappers around the required functionality, e.g. NMRDATA::Add/RemoveHydrogens(OBMol*) which would call the relevant OBMol function and then have some extra code to update the sdf field. I should point out that this problem could have been entirely avoided by using a tag that didn't depend on atom order, but rather was based on intrinsic properties of the SDF file format, for example, involving atom labels rather than atom orders.

Integrability,"Well I started writing a blog post, but when I looked into it closely, I thought I'd better trim a few of more obvious ones:. > There's an intial slow period where OB is loading the plugins (or at least, that's my interpretation). Focusing on the plateau, it seems that 63% of the time is spent writing the molecule, while 31% is spent reading.

The fix here is probably to get rid of audit messages altogether, although avoiding the copy would an alternative. 3.4% of the time is spent on writing std::endl to the output buffer.

See for instance [atomic blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/import_export/mesh_atomic.html), and publications in JChemEduc ([example](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jchemed.1c00515), and [an other](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00907) just found by keyword `blender` for this journal alone).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2679#issuecomment-1988946089:2556,interface,interface,2556,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2679#issuecomment-1988946089,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"cript below performs a conversion explicitly requesting both standard output as well as the error stream. For unproblematic SMILES (i.e., entries reporting back with two lines [or line-feed separated records, in parlance of AWK]) the canonical SMILES string is provided. Though written for Linux Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing), by use of AWK, this approach aims to be portable for other platforms (maybe others may check on this). Reporting only the (processed) canonical SMILES passing the filter successfully equally should be helpful when running OpenBabel with the optional `--errorlevel <N>` (default 2 out of 5, cf. [section 3.2](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Command-line_tools/babel.html)). ```awk; #!/usr/bin/awk -f. # name: filter.awk; # author: nbehrnd@yahoo.com; # license: GPL v2, 2022; # date: <2022-03-23 Wed>; # edit: <2022-03-28 Mon>. # Retain ""reasonable"" SMILES strings OpenBabel may process gently.; #; # For a successful application of this filter, this AWK script depends; # on a running installation of OpenBabel and AWK.

Integrability,"g I have been doing. I'm running the same smi-sdf-can roundtrip test from `test/testdistgeom.py` on a large dataset (eMolecules SMILES database, only considering chiral molecules). So far, **17670 molecules** have been processed **without any segfaults or wrong stereochemistry**. There is only a minor cosmetic issue which should be fixed I think. For some structures, the number of iterations in `OBDistanceGeometry` is not enough to generate a valid structure. This results in a warning message:; ```; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in AddConformer; Distance Geometry failed.; ```; The full roundtrip still produces the correct geometry since we now have an additional loop in Gen3D. However, seeing this message is confusing if the whole process actually worked. Ideally, `AddConformer()` would return a boolean to indicate success. This would change the API/ABI. Some possible workarounds:; 1. Increase the number of iterations (currently equal to the number of atoms).; 2. Add function and member variable (in `OBDistanceGeometryPrivate`) to silence this message.; 3. Remove message and add function to check succes/failure. For the 17670 molecules, there were only 7 such cases. These are listed below together with the number of times OBDistanceGeometry failed. ```; O\C=C1\CCCCC1=O 1 iteration failed; C[C@H]1CCC\C=C\[C@@H]2C[C@H](O)C[C@H]2[C@H](O)\C=C\C(=O)O1 5 iterations failed; Cl\C=C\Cl 1 iteration failed; CO[C@H]1[C@H](O)CC(=O)O[C@H](C)C\C=C\C=C\[C@H](OC2CCC(C(C)O2)N(C)C)[C@H](C)C[C@H](CC=O)[C@@H]1OC1OC(C)C(OC2CC(C)(O)C(O)C(C)O2)C(C1O)N(C)C 3 iterations failed; C\C1=C/CC(C)(C)\C=C\C\C(C)=C\CC1 1 iteration failed; CCO\C=C\CC 1 iteration failed; CO[C@H]1[C@@H](CC(=O)O[C@H](C)C\C=C\C=C\[C@H](O)[C@H](C)C[C@H](CC=O)[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(O)[C@@H](OC(=O)CC(C)C)[C@H](C)O2)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)N(C)C)OC(C)=O 5 iterations failed; ```; In any case, it might be a good idea to have a minimum number of iterations to handle these small molecules.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2158#issuecomment-610071981:1142,message,message,1142,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2158#issuecomment-610071981,2,['message'],['message']
Integrability,"hanks for the hint to use `echo` to pipe a SMILES string to OpenBabel. So far, I used a syntax like. `obabel -:""c1ccccc1"" --gen3d -oxyz`. to obtain the backbone of benzene. _For OpenBabel_, the input. `obabel -:'c1ccccc1' --gen3d -oxyz`. -- the SMILES string enclosed by single quotes instead -- yields a result equivalent to the other (just checked again, OpenBabel 3.1.0 running in Linux Debian 11/bullseye, testing) as long as there is no space between the colon and the leading single / double quote. The absolute (x,y,z) coordinates about the same atom may differ from each other for either one of the two approaches. But, this equally is the case running either one of the two commands again, and again, too. I attribute these small variations to the MMFF optimization OpenBabel uses to offer rapidly a geometry «good enough» to continue work elsewhere. This being said, I see the number of protons differ from how `-p <integer_value>` is used. In contrast to my anticipation, this number however varies, depending if `--gen3d` is used, or not. Your suggest to pipe the intermediate SMILES string adjusted for the pH value explicitly set _then used_ for `--gen3d` is the better, because safer approach. With the same setup, results indeed differ as shown below:. + formic acid in acid, as expected 2 protons:; > $ obabel -:'C(=O)O' -p 1 -oxyz; > 5; > ; > C 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > O 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > O 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > H 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > H 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > 1 molecule converted. + formiate, as expected only one proton:; > $ obabel -:'C(=O)O' -p 14 -oxyz; > 4; > ; > C 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > O 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > O 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > H 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000; > 1 molecule converted. + formiate, unexpectedly writing two protons:; > $ obabel -:'C(=O)O' -p 14 --gen3d -oxyz; > 5; > ; > C 1.10369 -0.02330 -0.04653; > O 0.44240 0.56154 -0.88483; > O 2.44963 -0.04201 -0.01971; > H 0.68143 -0.60513 0.78745; > H 2.79396 -0.56462 0.72",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2358#issuecomment-823088435:1012,depend,depending,1012,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2358#issuecomment-823088435,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"hemical Formats ; seems to be to a 256 character limit on the filter string ; and has only come to light when all the formats were ; included. Why this should occur needs tracking down. (5) illustrates a UI dilemma. Should ; a)the type of file requested, or ; b)the extension of the file selected by the user ; have priority on what format OB attempts to convert. I ; chose b), and I provided a Force this Format checkbox to ; cover the case where this was not what was required. You ; prefer a), giving priority to the user's earlier choice ; via the Format dropdown and an opportunity to Force file ; Extension via a checkbox. Both are reasonable, but I ; prefer a) on the principle that it uses a later deliberate ; user choice. (6) I agree that more feedback is needed to help the user ; to know whether local or file input is being used. Making ; it read-only when the file option is selected and ; automatically updating the contents from a file seem to be ; good ways. (8) This is not a bug. SMILES has no coordinate ; information; a straight conversion correctly gives zero ; coordinates. At present OpenBabel doesn't have the ; capability to generate coordinates. I'm not an expert, but ; I suspect that this can be done at many levels of realism, ; with the top ones being big computations. OB needs ; something though, and the user must be given it as an ; option and be made aware somehow of the possible ; deficiencies. The 4mols.smi wasn't really intended as an example; it ; just got left there. I agree that a 3D molecule would be ; better. The GUI really needs to display error/audit messages, and ; I guess this could be a pane at the bottom of the window. ; It also cannot handle some feature of the commandline ; interface - like specifying the target for a fastsearch as ; a file, and setting audit levels. And of course it needs a ; graphical display for molecular structure and some of the ; other nice features of Chris Swain's Mac interface. .

Integrability,"nbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2. This however is more and more an exception.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1832,depend,dependencies,1832,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"om) and \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 90 (degrees), yet stating the triclinic space group P1. Solution NMR does provide other information about protein structures, in _partial_ overlap with what protein crystallography by diffraction on solid samples provides. One may anticipate some quality checks for model data from crystals are not applicable here. Contrasting to this, a .pdb file does not require the provision of lattice constants because the description of a single, individual, isolated molecule is sufficent. So if there are no a, b, c, \alpha, \beta, \gamma in original .pdb accessible to you, openbabel has nothing to add about them when exporting a .cif. On the other hand, the conversion of the (multimodel) .cif provided by the database into individual .pdb (one molecule each) still is possible with other programs than openbabel. From the terminal within [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/), for example, you may access the multimodel .cif by. ```; load ""1ner.cif"";; ```; where it will recognize the presence of 30 models. It is possible to access them one by one via the GUI (right mouse button click into the canvas), or from the program's console, e.g. ```; load models ({4}) ""1ner.cif"";; ````. to access only the fifth model in the .cif file. From there, it is possible to export them, for example by either one of the following. ```; write ""model5.pdb"";; write ""model5.sdf"" as v3000;; ```; (the `as v3000` is to access the more modern variant of .sdf allowing e.g., a larger number of atoms). If you anticipate the conversions ahead are multiple, consider to write a [Jmol script](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/) and run Jmol without a GUI:. ```bash; jmol -ions water_script.spt; ```. with . ```; -i,--silent silent startup operation; -n,--nodisplay no display (and also exit when done); -o,--noconsole no console -- all output to sysout; -s,--script <arg> script file to execute; ```.

Integrability,"orial/stdlib.html). Additional functionality can be imported by additional libraries. One way to manage these *new dependencies* is by a `requirements.txt` file to list these modules -- preferably with indication of their (minimal) version known to work. For example. ```; CairoSVG>=2.7.1; openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16; rdkit>=2023.3.2; Requests>=2.31.0; ```. To keep the Python libraries which support your operating system in good shape, it is considered good practice to keep them separate (not accidentally modified) from packages used to develop and experiment with new packages. This is the background of using *virtual environments* which you. - first create, i.e. set up of a minimal clean Python environment; - second activate, i.e. to start using them; - third complement by additional Python packages (if needed) to provide additional functionality. *Here* the special file `requirements.txt` helps you because . ```shell; pip install -r ./requirements.txt; ```. is going to resolve the dependencies for you automatically. In case *virtual environments* is a concept new to you, Python documents it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Real Python offers a free [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) less technical if you prefer so. In each case: note that the commands in Windows, Linux, MacOS to toggle on/off the virtual environment differ of each other. The advantage of this development *separate* from the libraries used by your operating system: you don't harm your OS. If you are stuck in an error, deactivate the virtual environment, delete the whole folder of this virtual environment, and start all over from scratch. Obviously, for your project, you have to identify and use *your project's* `requirements.txt`. If there is no `requirements.txt`, get in touch with the author of the application. Else, set up a virtual environment, activate it and install [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to quickly generate a `require",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034:1596,depend,dependencies,1596,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"possible, I recommend the use of of the `.sdf` format for the intermediate step because (in contrast to e.g., `.xyz`) it equally contains what MDL coined as _connection table_ about which (and how) atoms are bound. A) The more verbose approach consists of three distinct instructions to the CLI. This documents each step by a permanent record.; `obabel -:'OC(C1=NC=CC=C1CC2=CC=C(C3CCC(S(=O)(NC)=O)CC3)C=C2)=O' --gen2d -osdf -O 2D.sdf`; `obabel -isdf 2D.sdf --gen3d -osdf -O 3D.sdf`; And, because you want to continue with the `.mol2` format; `obabel -isdf 3D.sdf -omol2 -O 3D.mol2`. B) The more condensed approach uses the intermediate output of one of the steps mentioned above as input for the subsequent step. Thus, you start with the SMILES string to form the `.mol2` files without creation of intermediate permanent files. Call OpenBabel with one line of instruction in the pattern of; `obabel -:'OC(C1=NC=CC=C1CC2=CC=C(C3CCC(S(=O)(NC)=O)CC3)C=C2)=O' --gen2d -osdf | obabel -isdf --gen3d -osdf | obabel -isdf -omol2 -O 3D_relayed.mol2`. The comparison of the two approaches reveals that coordinates in the `.mol2` files written differ from each other. As shown, e.g. by vimdiff ([an introduction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vim/vim_diff.htm), but you may use a difference viewer of your preference), these differences however _do not_ affect the connection tables in the later part of the `.mol2` files:. ![diff_view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/114673269-878cbc00-9cf5-11eb-8cef-6c68f1e53f15.png). Depending on the intended use of the `.mol2`, these differences may not be relevant to you.*) Or, you use them anyway as a _starting point_ for further minimization with one of the force field options in OpenBabel or a third party program. *) Simplified into the `.xyz` format, you may quantify the difference of the geometries, e.g. by a [Kabsch test](https://github.com/charnley/rmsd).

Integrability,"recognize what type of SMILES string is offered to; you. In this perspective, I perceive OpenBabel as advantageous in; comparison to ChemDraw because with toggles like `-osmi` or `-ocan`; you may explicitly define which «dialect» the SMILES will be (e.g.,; canonical, universal, inchified). Like with any programs, as soon as you interface with other programs,; the lack of convention (or deployment of programs designed to adhere; different conventions), this may be anything in the spectrum of; «below the detection limit», «nuisance», and «incompatible». Say you; successfully load the structure in the JS of ChemDraw mentioned; earlier and request the interface to provide the SMILES string. You; may feed this string into OpenBabel in a pattern like. ```bash; obabel -:""c1ccncc1"" -osmi; ```. to ask OpenBabel for a SMILES representation (here about pyridine,; just substitute the SMILES string from ChemDraw accordingly). Here,; `-osmi` and `-ocan` yield the same SMILES string. With a molecule; more complex, like the cyclic one of yours, however, you are going to; recognize differences how input vs. output may differ, and how; different output options yield different SMILES generated by; OpenBabel, too. I don't know what you intend to do with the SMILES strings in hand.; Given observations like the ones mentioned above, I however notice my; tendency to withdraw from them and to deploy either InChI (for the; description and recreation of the structures), or InChIKey (their; hashes, for a convenient recognition of identity of two entries). For reasons beyond your initial question, I currently use one of the; handy reference implementations available for free (as in free beer); from the InChI trust.[1] These are compiled to run from the get-go; with 32 or 64 bit (either Windows or Linux, no separate Mac version); from the CLI to perform the assignment on (multi-model) .sdf files.; OpenBabel equally offers an interface to these two formats. https://www.inchi-trust.org/downloads/",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358:2017,interface,interface,2017,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"tension](https://github.com/diegoferigo/cmake-build-extension) to build the cmake project through `pip`. It works fine. Here openbabel library is installed into the Python directory `python3.x/site-packages/openbabel/lib/openbabel/3.1.1/`.; ```py; from cmake_build_extension import BuildExtension, CMakeExtension; setup(; ext_modules=[; CMakeExtension(name=""OpenBabel"",; install_prefix=""openbabel"",; source_dir=str(Path(__file__).parent.absolute() / ""source""),; cmake_configure_options=[; ""-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE="" + sys.executable,; ""-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"",; ""-DWITH_INCHI=ON"",; ""-DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON"",; ""-DRUN_SWIG=ON"",; ""-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=""+sysconfig.get_config_var('INCLUDEPY'),; ""-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=""+sysconfig.get_config_var('INCLUDEPY'),; ""-DBUILD_BY_PIP=ON"",; *cmake_options,; ]),; ],; cmdclass=dict(build_ext=BuildExtension),; ); ```. I modified the install directory of the Python module to make them directly install at `python3.x/site-packages/openbabel`. The build dependency can be defined in `pyproject.toml`:; ```toml; [build-system]; requires = [; ""setuptools>=61"",; ""setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2"",; ""wheel"",; ""cmake_build_extension"",; ""cmake"",; ""ninja"",; ""swig"",; ]; build-backend = ""setuptools.build_meta""; ```. 3. In the Python module, I have to set the environment `BABEL_LIBDIR` and `BABEL_DATADIR` at the beginning of the module. ```py; import os; base_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)); os.environ[""BABEL_LIBDIR""] = os.path.join(base_dir, ""lib"", ""openbabel"", __version__); os.environ[""BABEL_DATADIR""] = os.path.join(base_dir, ""share"", ""openbabel"", __version__); ```. 4. Finally I defined the configs for cibuildwheel, where I copied some configs from rdkit-pypi to install some dependencies.; ```toml; [tool.cibuildwheel]; test-command = ""python -c 'from openbabel import openbabel'""; build = [""cp37-*"", ""cp38-*"", ""cp39-*"", ""cp310-*"", ""cp311-*""]; skip = [""*-win32"", ""*-manylinux_i686"", ""*-musllinux*""].

Integrability,"thers to identify the possible cause; typically leading to an improvement how the program is used or/and an improvement of the program. You still can edit your question with the bits and bolts the template provides; perhaps especially to organize a report in sections (initiated by a head line following the `##`):. ```; ## Environment Information; Open Babel version:; Operating system and version:. ## Expected Behavior; <!-- Describe the intended output or what you expected to see. -->. ## Actual Behavior; <!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; ```. In addition, the interface allows to discern running text on one hand, from snippets of code / output back to the CLI on the other hand by markup as a code block: add three backticks in a line prior, and three backticks in a line following the section. Do not confuse backticks with single quotes. Because some characters might have a particular meaning to (GitHub flavored) [markdown syntax](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) used here, it equally is *safer* to enclose SMILES and SMARTS in backticks, too.

Integrability,"xplicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle cases where an atom is not in its normal valence state, or where the element's valence is not obvious. Once the actual-hydrogen or actual-valence values is defined, the ""implicit valence"" and ""implicit hydrogen"" count functions can be rewritten as derived properties rather than fundamental properties, and ""implicit valence"" functions can be marked as ""deprecated"" in the documentation. The SMILES parser could then easily note what an atom's actual valence is, as could other parsers. I think it's critical that we fix this, first by documenting how it is *supposed* to work, then by fixing the two most-affected parsers: mdlformat.cpp and smilesformat.cpp. (Or, I should say, these are the ones I need ;-) )."".

Modifiability," Babel Warning in CreateCisTrans; Error in cis/trans stereochemistry specified for the double bond. COCC(=C(OC(=O)C)CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(=C)CC=C)OC(=C)O)O)OCO 1 molecule converted; ```. The meaning of the formulae provided by CDKDepict[2] did not alter -- e.g., no change in the configuration of the stereogenic centers, and the double bond still can't be assigned to match either the pattern of (E), or (Z):. ![2022-03-30_CDKDepict_entry04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/160856599-8123cc0e-39b3-44b7-a2be-019bf7d5294b.png). Because I'm not aware if OpenBabel can resolve such ambiguities (here: to return one SMILES string with the explicit (E), and an other SMILES string with the explicit (Z) double bond) -- wouldn't be the more strict (pedantic?) remove of this entry an; advantage to address specific configurations?*. Last (but not least), the explicit return of problematic SMILES. The in-silico generation of molecules as SMILES appeared to me as affordable (enough) to skip entries with SMILES OpenBabel/partialsmiles perceive as problematic. Thus my change to focus on SMILES approved by partialsmiles/OpenBabel may process (the complementary set). The above SMILES string yielding a warning because of extended stereochemistry (options for .and. and .or.) equally calls for an adjustment of the parameters how the molecules are generated (outside OpenBabel) to use only SMILES with unambiguous stereochemistry. ---. *) On a tangent, this reminds me a bit to the extended stereochemistry options in .sdf (v3000 format) with logical .and. and .or. as seen e.g., in a presentation[3] by Andrey Yerin's about how to possibly improve InChI:. ![2022-03-30_Yerin_InChI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/160856761-5908e26c-1f6d-4657-b6cb-0d55acbd2c53.png).

Modifiability,"(i) checking if the compiler has support for a flag using CMake:; check_c_compiler_flag(-mpopcnt HAS_POPCOUNT). (ii) I think the check Noel is referring to, and @jeffjanes for cross-compilation, is processor support. I agree with @jeffjanes that there is an issue where the library could be compiled on a computer with processor support, then run on a computer without it. The most common example is packaging for operating systems. Shipping rpms that require the popcnt instruction would be less than ideal. I also know of several pharma companies that use a module system such that openbabel is run from the same binaries/dynamic libraries on disparate hardware from new to 6+ years old. So, I think there should be some CMake variable set by the user at compilation time for turning it on or off.

Modifiability,". Do you think OpenBabel's report about this entry qualifies to skip the entry altogether?. For checks with partialsmiles'[1] `validate.py`, the entry passes well:. ```bash; $ python3 validate.py ""CC(O/C(\CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(CC=C)=C)OC(O)=C)O)=C(\COC)/OCO)=O""; Input: CC(O/C(\CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(CC=C)=C)OC(O)=C)O)=C(\COC)/OCO)=O. 1. Parse as full SMILES:. OK. 2. Parse as partial SMILES:. OK. 3. Parse substrings as partial SMILES:. OK; ```. OpenBabel however issues a warning/error _interpreted_ as serious enough to remove this entry for good:. ```bash; $ obabel -:""CC(O/C(\CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(CC=C)=C)OC(O)=C)O)=C(\COC)/OCO)=O"" -ocan; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in CreateCisTrans; Error in cis/trans stereochemistry specified for the double bond. COCC(=C(OC(=O)C)CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(=C)CC=C)OC(=C)O)O)OCO 1 molecule converted; ```. The meaning of the formulae provided by CDKDepict[2] did not alter -- e.g., no change in the configuration of the stereogenic centers, and the double bond still can't be assigned to match either the pattern of (E), or (Z):. ![2022-03-30_CDKDepict_entry04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/160856599-8123cc0e-39b3-44b7-a2be-019bf7d5294b.png). Because I'm not aware if OpenBabel can resolve such ambiguities (here: to return one SMILES string with the explicit (E), and an other SMILES string with the explicit (Z) double bond) -- wouldn't be the more strict (pedantic?) remove of this entry an; advantage to address specific configurations?*. Last (but not least), the explicit return of problematic SMILES. The in-silico generation of molecules as SMILES appeared to me as affordable (enough) to skip entries with SMILES OpenBabel/partialsmiles perceive as problematic. Thus my change to focus on SMILES approved by partialsmiles/OpenBabel may process (the complementary set). The above SMILES string yielding a warning because of extended stereochemistry (options for .and. and .or.) equally calls for an adjustment of the paramet",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256:1238,config,configuration,1238,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256,1,['config'],['configuration']
