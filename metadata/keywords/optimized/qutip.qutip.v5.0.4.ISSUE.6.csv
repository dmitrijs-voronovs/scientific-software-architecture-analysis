Testability,"Hey,. It seems the sigmam() operator incorrectly returns True when tested with isherm.

You are right, there is a bug in the error handling.; ```; File ""C:\Users\OlekAdmin\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\qutip\qip\circuit.py"", line 2114, in initialize; raise ValueError(""dimension of state is incorrect""); ```; This check is wrong. It assumes that the state is a qubits state. Our test didn't cover the `run` method with multi-level systems. Here are the ways around:; - If you know how to hack the package, you can simply find the file and delete this error handling (lines 2113 and 2114).; - If you don't know how to do that, you can also use; ```; gate_sequence_product(qc.propagators()); ```; to compute the unitary representation of the circuit first and then apply it to the input state. I'll make a bug fix soon. But the next release may still take a while. Using `QubitCirucuit` for qutrits and qudits should be fine, it is rarely used though.

Testability,"Hi @VolodyaCO, thanks for reporting this!; I think the reason for `tlist` being overridden is because the result will be independent of `tlist` when the input is a steady-state. This can be seen in the following equations:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57414022/121327018-5d313680-c913-11eb-9760-ca6004daca18.png); where rho is the initial state (`state0`) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. I use the fact that rho is a steady-state to remove its temporal dependence. This derivation is simplified assuming unitary evolution (no collapse operators) but the same applies in the most general case where we include the collapse operators. This is my guess on why `tlist=[0]` is employed when using `state0=None`: the result does not depend on `tlist`. Hence, this is probably not a bug as the result should be mathematically correct. That being said, I would also expect the same output shape for the cases shown above unless explicitly mentioned in the docstring of the function. Thus, I think the way to go here is to document this behaviour in the docstring (as well as removing the t appearing in correlation_..._1t docstring) as any change in the output shape will break backwards compatibility. However, it may be worth considering whether this is the intended behaviour for QuTiP 5. I would suggest removing `state0=None` as possible input for simplicity in the maintenance and testing or at least I would make the example shown by @VolodyaCO to be consistent and have the same output.

Could you maybe leave some more descriptive comments in the tests? I find it a bit hard to follow the logic when tests are automatically generated or parametrized, e.g. in test_control_pulseoptim. A lot of things are defined for the fixtures in the beging. It took me some time to understand what is happening. I guess it is because I'm not yet very familiar with the tools in pytest. Maybe some description like ; > We first define 4 test cases: ... or. > Test function1 against case1, case2 ... This might make it easier for whoever wants to add more tests later to understand what has been tested without too much digging. And another personal idea, maybe it is good to make a separate PR every 10 or 15 tests? A new branch can still base on this one.

Testability,"Hi @nathanshammah,. Could this issue perhaps be broken into sub-tasks in some way, perhaps, in order to enable work starting on it a bit more feasible?. Also, I can see it's been labelled as a ""good first issue"" but it seems to me the definition of done (i.e., what would a PR - or a set of PRs - that would successfully address the problem entail?), with respect to the entire issue, could be clarified a bit further, and the breakdown into sub-tasks (which itself might result organically from some further discussion) might help a bit in that direction. Regarding possible approaches for handling randomness - I have to admit I've started looking into QuTiP only very recently, and I'm yet to start familiarising myself with its more intricate details and get to run the full set of tests, and investigate what kind of test failures occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:786,test,tests,786,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Hi @pschindler,. Indeed, the behavior you show is a bug in qutip 4.7.0. Thanks for reporting this! However, it is actually a bug in the `sparse=True` case. The scipy case gives a different result compared to qutip sparse because of the method used. `eigh` assumes the input is hermitian but `op` is not. You can see the correct eigenvalues using:; ```; In [7]: scipy.linalg.eigvals(op.full()); Out[7]:; array([-1. -2.22044605e-16j, -0.5+8.66025404e-01j, -0.5-8.66025404e-01j,; 0.5+8.66025404e-01j, 0.5-8.66025404e-01j, 1. +0.00000000e+00j]); ```. I am genuinely surprised that the `sparse=False` is bugged in the latest version of qutip. Fortunately, I tested this in the master branch of qutip (this contains the qutip 5.0.0 alpha version) and the bug seems to be solved there. This operator is indeed subjected to the same bug Eric shows (it is non-hermitian). However, due to the real part of the eigenvalues, it actually shows the correct answer (similar to the example I showed in my previous comment). I will try to find the source of the error but it seems very likely that we incorrectly label the operator as hermitian and hence uses the wrong method to find eigenvalues.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348:653,test,tested,653,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348,1,['test'],['tested']

A couple of small things:; - We try to make qutip python3 compatible, so please use python3 compatible print(...) function calls instead of print ... statements.; - Functions super_to_choi and choi_to_super seems to do the same thing, while the function names suggest complementary conversion. Is this intentional?; - I think it would be better if you move the test code from within the if **name** == '**main**' to a separate file in the examples directory, or even better as unit tests in qutip/tests/; - Avoid global import of qutip ""from qutip import *"" by only selectively importing the functions that you need (we try to do this internally in qutip to avoid circular module dependencies).; - Make relative import of qutip functions (for example from qutip.super_to_choi import super_to_choi). This is also required for python3 compatibility.; - Add an import of the main functions (for example subsystem_apply) to qutip/**init**.py ; - I would probably prefer the super_to_choi.py module be called something more general, like choi_decomposition,py (or something like that), which would reflect that it does not only contain the super_to_choi function but other related functions as well.; - Avoid printouts in choi_to_kraus function. If you want to enable debugging or diagnostic info, consider adding an optional function argument debug=False or verbose=False and print the vals and vecs variables only if the user explicitly asks for it. Otherwise, one could get an excessive amount of printouts if your code is used in a loop.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/22#issuecomment-18592742:426,test,test,426,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/22#issuecomment-18592742,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

If you want it to be part of qutip itself, since it solve the same problem as `sesolve`, it could be inserted as an options to `sesolve` or be it's own function. It would be better to not have too many function doing the same thing, but since we don't have many alternative method in `sesolve` it could be overlooked. Seeing the state of `krylovsolve`, both would be quite easy to do. Do you have benchmarks to compare it to `sesolve`?

Testability,"Hi Vutshi. Thanks a lot for this contribution! It's looking very interesting indeed. I'll be looking into the details of your code, notebook and your paper in the coming days, but from a first look it's looking great! I've been working a lot on the stochastic solvers the last few months, but it is still very much under development. The milstein method has been on my todo list for a long time, but I've not gotten around to work on it yet, so your contribution is very timely and most welcome!. I have tried to design the API in the most general way I could think of while still keeping the complexity from growing too much. Defining an SME with its RHS function, D1 and D2 functions has worked for most problems I considered so far, but I'd be happy to discuss further if this could be changed to something more flexible, like a function for calculating rho_{n+1} like you suggest. We hope to have the stochastic solver API ready and mature enough to include in the next qutip release sometime this fall, so it would be good to have these things tested and thoroughly discussed before then. But until the stochastic module is officially in the QuTiP API we still have a lot of freedom to shake things up if necessary. Also, to keep complexity and code duplication down I wanted to follow the pattern. smesolve (choose solver by argument) -> smesolve_generic -> specific method and SDE by rhs, d1, d2 selection. So it would be good if smesolve_mil and smesolve_impl in your code could be combined with smesolve, and if smesolve_implicit and smesolve_milstein could be combined with smesolve_generic, etc. That would reduce a lot of code duplication I think. Of course, if smesolve_generic needs to be changed to accommodate this that would be totally fine with me. It would be great if you could do a pull request of this to the qutip master, then we could discuss details in the PR.

Testability,"Hi all,. I'm not sure how to do pull request in this case so let it be a new Issue. I have implemented Milstein method for solving SME for homodyne detection scheme. For my problems it works much better than the simple Euler-Maruyama method. In case of a single Wiener increment all what is required is the new rhs function (see notebook attached). For multiple Wiener increments the provided infrastructure of QuTiP is not enough. One needs to provide all of the A_ops to the rhs. The modified stochastic.py file is also attached (from qutip.stochastic import smesolve_mil). The attached Notebook contains an example of SME with an analytical solution. Which allows to test smesolver for a single quantum trajectory. The notebook and the modified stochastic.py is here:; http://db.tt/dJNjGo3g. P.S. Due to nonlinearity in the stochastic term of quantum SME the simple Euler-Maruyama scheme doesn't work properly sometimes. Even Milstein struggles. From my experience semi implicit methods help.

Testability,"Hi guys, thanks for looking at this! I actually made a fork to implement this: https://github.com/lfry512/qutip. In my fork I added some extra type checks and some extra functions in _LiouvillianFromFunc that support a c_ops callback. The way this was done just requires the user to use qt.lindblad_dissipator where appropriate. The use case that isn't implemented is H in list format and c_ops as a callback. @Ericgig thanks for the neat suggestion! This is very pertinent as I then moved on to try the same functionality with mcsolve, which doesn't support a callback for H and c_ops in the master branch. Yesterday I got callback functionality working for H in mcsolve but haven't committed it yet. However it's about 20 times slower than using the equivalent list format in my tests. @jakelishman it sounds like you worked on mcsolve. If you are interested I would love to discuss with you how to make the H callback method for mcsolve more efficient. I'm also trying to figure out if it is possible to make a cython callback builder class that can be used for building the Lindblad operators from instantaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian more efficiently.

Testability,"Hi guys,; yeah, the conflicts are because of the now merged #1224, which we knew about when we merged that one. It's a simple fix, but I'm hesitant to do it directly on this PR, depending on how we want to merge it.

Testability,Hi! I tried running `conda install nomkl qutip` and then ran the test. I can confirm it solved the issue. I doubt it is a good permanent solution though. Would you recommend reverting back to MKL and upgrading numpy to 1.22?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1750#issuecomment-1005729943:65,test,test,65,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1750#issuecomment-1005729943,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Hi!. #### Imports; Honestly it wasn't really a particularly conscious decision, and there's no problem with `from qutip import (x, y, z)` lines though I don't think `from qutip import *` is a very good idea, especially with quite how many names `qutip` exports. The `from qutip.very.deep.nested.module import name` is certainly good, and I think I've generally left those. I think I started converting in a few places because there were things like `from qutip import Cubic_Spline` and `from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline`, and then the test was unreadable as to which was which. Having `qutip.Cubic_Spline` and `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` is unambiguous. The smaller cases like `from qutip import Qobj` are highly unlikely to have any conflicts, but in general I just went for consistency. That all said, there's certainly arguments both ways, e.g. explicit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:544,test,test,544,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Hi!. About the comments: yes, absolutely I'll leave more. It's a bit silly that I haven't yet, since one thing that was frustrating me previously was not understanding what was trying to be done! I think as time goes by I'm getting a bit better about being clearer in the code - some of the earlier parametrizations I did were too aggressive because I wasn't used to the tools yet. The `test_control_pulseoptim` parts are very complex, in part because the underlying calling convention of that code is complex too. I'll try and add more comments to it to ease that along, especially in the part where I just defined a load of systems to test. That certainly should have been commented. There are general comments about what I was using the `pytest` tooling for in the commit messages, but I didn't necessarily want to leave ""intro to pytest"" comments throughout, because it would mostly crowd out the actual tests, and the `pytest` documentation online is probably going to be a better explanation than what I can do. I'm also learning `pytest` by doing this (I'd not used it before I opened the first PR)!. About the PRs: I'm happy with whatever workflow works best for you guys - I don't have any control over when the PR gets merged. It might be a little difficult for me to maintain two branches at once (i.e. if the first PR with ~10 tests is awaiting merging), because there's likely to be conflicts in `conftest.py` (in particular). Even if I branched the new PR off the previous one on the expectation that it would be merged, I'd have to keep adding merge commits into (or force-rebasing) the other branch to keep it up-to-date, which wouldn't be completely ideal in that it would make a bit of a mess in the git log. If you want to merge this one (after I've gone through and put some more comments in), I'm happy to start a new one. I can also start a new one on a new branch, I think it might just make a bit more of a mess than it solves.

Testability,"Hi, this is just a refactoring of @nwlambert 's code for a generic HEOM solver which takes in a set of exponents and coefficients for a spectral density function and can be used to work with arbitrary spectral density functions. In comparison, the current `heom` solver in QuTiP is specialized. . Specific quantum systems in the `qutip/models` sub-module could have the following signature:; ```; model = System(hamiltonian, **params); result = model.solve(initial_state, tlist, options); ```; System specific functions could be in the model class. For instance,; ```; model._rhs(); ```; gives the RHS (a matrix equivalent to an effective Liouvillian) of the density matrix evolution equation. If any system can be written down as the evolution of an initial density matrix as dp/dt = (RHS)p, and there is an optimised way to solve, it can be written down as a qutip.model. The other necessary function would be a basis change map or a lookup dictionary for translating a state tuple to the index in the larger density matrix which is used for the evolution using the effective Liouvillian. This is the `_heom_state_dictionaries` in this case and `jmm1_dictionary` in case of the WIP #753 . The code in the current form is good enough to be used but it needs to be optimized further.

Testability,"Hi,. I have been trying to use `qutip.floquet.floquet_master_equation_steadystate` method to get the steadystate of my system, but the docstring is not super useful. From the docstring, I guess I should call it as `qutip.floquet.floquet_master_equation_steadystate(H, A)` where. * `H` is my (time-dependent) hamiltonian, similar as the one used in http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html#floquet-formalism-in-qutip.; * `A` is the [`A` matrix output](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py#L587-L588) from `floquet_master_equation_rates` call. I think I missed something as I am getting an error; ```; TypeError: Solving for steady states requires Liouvillian (super) operators; ```; from https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/steadystate.py#L224. Additionnally, I think there is a much easier way to find the steadystate of such a system, using something like (not really well written nor optimised):. ```python; def floquet_master_equation_steadystate2(A):; """"""; TODO. Parameters; ----------. A : TODO; A matrix used to build the master equation.; """"""; B = np.zeros_like(A); N = A.shape[0]; for a in range(N):; for b in range(N):; # Convergence of off-diagonal terms in density matrix to 0; assert(-0.5 * np.sum(A[:, a] + A[:, b]) < 0); # Diagonal terms of density matrix; if a != b:; B[a, b] = A[a, b]; else:; B[a, b] = -1.0 * np.sum([; A[nu, a] for nu in range(N) if nu != a]; ); eigval, eigvec = Qobj(B).eigenstates(); assert(np.isclose(eigval[-1], 0, atol=1e-15)); return eigvec[-1] * eigvec[-1].dag(); ```. which basically looks for the eigenvector associated with 0 eigenvalue of a matrix derived from `A`, which is basically coming directly from equation 251 of [Gri98](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/biblio.html#gri98).",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/768:1250,assert,assert,1250,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/768,2,['assert'],['assert']
Testability,"Hi,. I think your new implementation of API should be flexible enough to incorporate any explicit scheme. The reason I think it is useful to calculate \rho_{n+1} is to apply a semi implicit method. This is what is done by Lsparse. I tried two ways of doing it. First, one can calculate (1 - (L+d1)_dt)^(-1) and apply it to to the stochastic part of the equation. Another way is to calculate the deterministic evolution expm[(L+d1)_dt] and also apply it to the stochastic part. Both of these methods work for linear deterministic part like in the homodyne detection. I've got good results with these semi-implicit methods on a problem with a few qubits. Due to a big nonlinearity for some parameters regime it really helps to apply the true deterministic evolution (or its approximation). For another regime it is better to use explicit method. In principle it should be good to adjust degree of implicitness. Anyway I'm still looking into the problem and comparing different possibilities. I hope to produce a new notebook with tests soon. This Milstein realisation is compatible in principle with the heterodyne detection. I'm not sure it is possible to express everything in terms of d1 and d2 only. The point is that I need to use derivatives of d2. I don't really see a problem to have separate RHSs for homodyne, heterodyne and photocurrent detections. I'll think a bit more about unification of homodyne and heterodyne and then I'll submit a pull request. Regarding expm for large systems. We need to calculate it only once, it works for small systems so I think it is a good option to have.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22116628:1028,test,tests,1028,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22116628,1,['test'],['tests']

I did drop in a couple of comments in-line (minor nitpicking), but given that this file may well get pretty much overwritten - keeping the actual tests, of course! - in short order, I wouldn't consider them changes that need to be made, unless Boxi asks.

Tests here seem to be two-folded:. - Test classical controlled gates in a circuit; - Test the measurement functions. So maybe we can split it. The teleportation circuit test can be done without measurement. Just check the final state tracing out the ancillary qubits. The test for measurement can probably be done for single or two `Qobj` along without circuit. But `run_circuit_statistics`... Probably we then only need to check if the number of elements in the result is correct after some 50 runs?. On a different matter, I'm wondering if running the statistics takes so long, for such a small teleportation circuit, is it still advantageous in any case? Since we are doing simulation and have the full quantum state, one can actually calculate all 4 possible final states, classically mix them into a density matrix with the corresponding measurement probability and calculate the exact statistics distribution.

Testability,"However, I think the logic behind BLAS Info is not robust. For context, debian builds packages against generic libblas.so (libblas-dev package). The various optimised BLAS implementations are supposed to be binary compatible, such that the system administrator can install the preferred implementation for use at runtime (the identity of libblas.so is controlled using debian's alternatives mechanism). On my system, OpenBLAS is indeed installed. But taking a closer look, I'm not sure it was detected for the right reason.; The blas configuration is identified by the `_blas_info()` function in qutip/utilities.py. It uses the local numpy configuration (`np.__config`), testing the availability of various attributes in the numpy config, in the form of ; ```; if hasattr(config,'mkl_info') ...; elif hasattr(config,'openblas_info'); ```. MKL was not used to build debian's numpy package, and I don't have it installed. So mkl_info is not detected. OpenBLAS was not used to to build numpy either, but it is installed, so I want look closer at the logic. config (i.e. `np.__config__`) does indeed have an openblas_info. But it is empty (`{}`). Nevertheless `hasattr(config,'openblas_info')`returns True, since the empty dict is there. As far as MKL goes, mkl_info is indeed not there, so qutip does not detect MKL BLAS. But there is a `blas_mkl_info` attribute, and `hasattr(config,'blas_mkl_info')` returns True, same as with openblas_info. numpy provides a summary of its configuration in `np.show_config()`:; ```; numpy.show_config(); blas_armpl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_mkl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blis_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; openblas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; accelerate_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_info:; libraries = ['blas', 'blas']; library_dirs = ['/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu']; include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']; language",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053:1259,log,logic,1259,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"I added a section to the test suite that will skip the tests if pyopencl is not installed in the last commit. To get them working, installing pyopencl via pip will not be sufficient. There are nice guides for setting up OpenCL in [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OpenCL) and [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU#OpenCL). But most OpenCL implementations are proprietary. I found an example of installing AMDAPP in a travis vm [here](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/OpenCL.jl/blob/master/.travis.yml). This is the OpenCL implementation I would recommend in absence of a GPU. But this script circumvents the license agreement and I am not sure whether this is legal. If you still intent to set this up, you can push changes to this branch as well. As for documentation I feel there is not much to document. There are already notebooks showing how to use `mcsolve` [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/example-photon_birth_death.ipynb) and [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-6-Quantum-Monte-Carlo-Trajectories.ipynb).

Testability,"I added a test that compares `correlation_2op_1t` to its analytical solution.

I was wondering whether the analytical solution I got was wrong or whether this actually makes sense. I was thinking that the difference probably comes from the cut we use for the number of states (`N = 20`).

Testability,I agree with @jakelishman's general principle (and maybe we should even move the tests out of the `qutip` package for v5 still) but it's also really important to have an easy way for data layer implementations to run a comprehensive test suite *that is defined by the data layer*. I suspect that if anyone is running tests against master (i.e. what is currently dev.major) they will *want* tests to break if we add new methods. I have a slightly different proposal:. What if we create `qutip.core.data.testing` which is an explicitly exported suite of pytest classes that we intentionally expose for data layers to use? Initially the file can just import test classes from `qutip.tests.core.data`. I would also not use `__all__` in the individual test packages but instead import the test classes explicitly in `qutip.core.data.testing` so that it's 100% clear by reading just that file what the exported interface is (and adding new tests requires explicitly adding them into the exposed package).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979884874:81,test,tests,81,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979884874,11,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"I completely agree with you that random tests really aren't the right way to go in general, but right now our problem is that basically QuTiP's entire testing suite is based on randomised tests, and that's an awful lot of technical debt to overcome any time soon :(. . The `dnorm` tests have historically been a huge problem, even though basically nobody's worked on `dnorm` for a long long time now (for context, see in particular #880 and #874). We don't actually even know if the failures in `dnorm` are deterministic and reproducible, although it turns out that I had a brief look into this when I joined as a GSoC student about a year ago... I don't remember doing it at all!. I know this is super inelegant and not the perfect method, but it's kind of a nasty trade-off - I don't have time to really dig into `dnorm` (a topic I know almost nothing about) to work out an appropriate solution to temperamental errors, we do want `dnorm` to be tested since we're shipping it, and the slight flakiness keeps causing us test suite failures about 1 in 10 times. I'm somewhat opposed to fixing the random seed because having the variance over several test runs does actually help us cover more ground (eventually) - fixing it to a ""known good"" seed actually seems to me to be more of a mask of potential problems than this. Of note: the pytest plugin I'm using reports the number of reruns it performed in the analysis at the bottom - they show up in a yellow alongside the ""skips"" and ""xfails"" - so it's not completely hidden. I'd love to have a property-based testing suite like hypothesis up and running - that definitely seems like the proper solution to this in the end. In the meantime, I'm open to swapping to a fixed random seed if you think that's much better - testing is one place where I'm really aware of my lack of formal experience in software engineering, so I'm basically just learning as I go.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227:40,test,tests,40,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227,9,['test'],"['test', 'tested', 'testing', 'tests']"

When that previously happened, the package actually worked, it just reported that error. My guess is that this happens if `pyximport.install()` has already been activated when `qutip` is imported, and consequently the test in `__init__.py` as to whether `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs` is importable causes this error. It should not be able to even attempt to import it _unless_ `pyximport` has been turned on, and if it's been turned on by something other than QuTiP, then it should fail with a `numpy` header file error instead (this is something we should probably fix too, but I've not noticed it before).

Testability,"I don't have xvfb (pytest-xvfb) installed specifically for qutip, but it is used by other packages (The general use of pytest-xvfb is to facilitate testing of GUI, graphical or windowing functionality without having an normal Xserver active. That is, it can be useful for automated CI testing of gui packages, for instance in chroots or cloud CI infrastructure). Since qutip doesn't use xvfb directly this bug won't be a problem for general CI testing, where only qutip is loaded on a cloud instance (for instance Debian testing done at https://ci.debian.net/packages/q/qutip/). But before I upload a package to the Debian infrastructure, I like to run the tests on my own system to be confident they're likely to pass. So this is where the problem happens, running tests on my own system, where I have pytest-xvfb installed for testing other packages. (pytest has this bad habit of loading all available plugins whether or not they're actually used by the tests being run. It's quite annoying actually. It would be better if it only loaded plugins specified in conftest.py). So the use case is running the qutip tests on my own system, where pytest-xvfb simply happens to be installed for other purposes not related to qutip. There are ways of working around the problem, for instance the `--no-xvfb` option could be explicitly added to the `pytest` command line.

So with a tol at 1e-8, the test can fail from numerical error with nothing wrong in the test. If you look are the sparse eigen solver, for a 100x100 matrix with only 10 non-zero values, all along the diagonal, it does not find any` 0` eigen values: there are about 89x `~e-36`, 1x `~e-17` and the 10 non-zeros values.

Testability,"I don't think this is the right way to solve your problem, but we probably should be consistent. `Qobj` is not a container for arbitrary data, and a 1x1 `Qobj` basically should never exist. If I remember correctly, the auto-promotion to `Qobj` is to avoid breaking backwards compatibility, because 4.x doesn't use the `@` syntax at all. We almost certainly should be moving to remove that ""feature"", not add to it - it should never work with compound Hilbert spaces (we should be safe-by-default), and trying to detect special behaviour on 1x1 inputs just leads to weird edge cases and breakages all over the place. You probably want some sort of different mechanism for deciding what types a `Qobj.data` instance can accept in `mul`. At the moment, the test is `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`, but you want to accept `tensorflow.Variable` if the backing data is TF-like.

Essentially I think the issue is your A operator is diagonal, and in 4.7 there is a check that notices it is diagonal, and quickly returns the result. In v5, there is a similar check for sparse matrices, but the default behavior is to convert to dense, so the check is not done. if you use expm(dtype=""CSR"") the v5 example should be quick (with the caveat that the result is nan in both 5 and 4.7).

Better visualization such that all initializations, measurements and corrections can be stacked in one line. 3.

Testability,"I know you've marked this as draft, but let me point out that you've not really aligned your `master` with ours after the merge (one of the reasons it's not a good idea to develop using `master`). You've merged in the changes from our branch, but really you needed to overwrite your local copy with ours; I squashed the previous PR down into just one commit to keep the commit log cleaner and easier to interpret. In this sort of triangular workflow where you're proposing PRs that might not be merged as-is, you need to treat our repository as the single source of truth - you should never change your `master` branch except by doing `git pull` to our repository, so you can't get out of sync. Since you've now developed on the top of an incorrect tip, it'll be a bit difficult for you to untangle if you're not very familiar with `git`. You _can_ do it with rebasing or cherry-picking techniques to keep what you've done, but in this particular case (and there's no way you could have known this), I was actually just about to publish PR #1490 that makes all these same changes in `test_metrics.py`, but also goes a lot further in rewriting the tests in a more pytest-y style. It might be better for you if you reset your repository to match ours exactly, and then start again using the proper branching structure for the superoperator and tensor tests you wanted to look at. Perhaps you could have a look at #1490 as well to see how I go about parametrising tests and organising everything to keep it tidy (not saying that my code is perfect by a long shot, and the concept of ""random"" tests is questionable overall, but it's what we've got at the moment). Remember as well that readibility is a big concern. Using an automated tool to enforce pep8 compliance often won't get you the best results - our real style requirement is that it's easy to read, so linebreaks should be in sensible places (that still abide by pep8).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778:377,log,log,377,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778,5,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'tests']"
Testability,"I looked at the failures and they seem to be in parts that are completely disconnected from logging. I have no idea why they aren't also in the main branch, but I'll investigate. Anyway, I agree with you, @jrjohansson, that the current implementation is not in keeping with the design of Python's logging package. At the time, it was a bit of a hack to try and make it fit as well as possible, but I think in retrospect that may have been misguided.

Testability,"I made some benchmarks timing different way to call matmul and contouring the dispatcher is worth it. ; For 10x10, CRS x Dense, it's 4x slowdown for matmul and 2x for expect.; For 1000 x 1000, it's 10% and 5%, reasonable but still felt. The easiest would be having `matmul(self, Dense in, Dense out)` method for Data layer. There is no need for all pairs of layer types to be supported by this, states in scipy's solver are always Dense. But it's a little late for that. Not having that, since 99% of users will use our data type and we only really need it for `matmul` and `expect`, we can so a manual disptach for just those. The way I did it was quite ugly, I wanted to limit the calls to `isinstance` which are not proper cython so did it once moving the type. I did not think of `type`...; `type(op) is CSR` is 15x faster than `isinstance(op, CSR)` and about as fast as comparing for enums, making have `layer_type` useless.

Testability,"I think `hypothesis` is the best method here in the long term, but it will most likely have to be a long-term goal. I think the main pro in favour of it is that it actually is making an attempt to remove randomness; it's attempting to comprehensively test a spanning set of input parameters, rather than just Monte-Carlo'ing our way through and hoping. There's a couple of points which make it difficult to implement:. 1. QuTiP can be quite fragile with respect to unexpected input formats, particularly in older parts of the code.; 2. Various components are only accurate up to some tolerance, and the error propagation to work out how that corresponds to useful measurable quantities can be rather tricky. Those are certainly both solvable problems, and point 1 in particular is just general improvement of usability. The second point is about designing the tests well, which again is certainly doable, but will take a while (it takes long enough just to refactor them, let alone a total rewrite of large chunks of them!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663:251,test,test,251,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"I think the module should really be `qutip.testing` (or `qutip.test` if the name's already taken), not `qutip.core.data.testing`, if you're going to add one. It's very likely to be the case in the future (if it isn't already) that you'll need additional dependencies to define the tests, and you don't want to force _all_ runtime users to have them to install QuTiP. If you put the package in a separate top-level module, it's _far_ easier to separate out all the code, and have `qutip/__init__.py` not import `qutip.testing`, so things won't break. Also, tests generally need to work with a fully imported version of the module. If we start putting testing infrastructure in the core, we're going to encode a whole lot of cyclical dependencies right away, or end up with `testing` modules scattered all across the codebase, for no real gain. For discovery: that would only happen during test generation, which comes after importing the modules and defining the classes, so you'd still be able to define tolerances and influence how the tests ran. The problem with _not_ having discovery is that it becomes very easy to forget to test a function, and with so much of the machinery automated, it's also easy to forget it when reviewing a PR. That's particularly true once you have external contributors writing these sorts of things - we have it in Qiskit, where people add things to our ""standard equivalence library"", and new contributors and new reviewers don't know where all the different tests are, so our discovery tests have helped catch bugs. That happens even with super experienced team members. I'd argue that code coverage metrics are possibly a better way of detecting missing tests - that fails safe if you add broken code and forget to test it, whereas having to specify the tests explicitly means you can accidentally add broken code to a dispatcher and not know, if you forgot to add the test.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735:43,test,testing,43,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735,17,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"I'd be vastly surprised if there's a way of permitting a test which passes 99% of the time - on any particular test run how would it know?. I don't remember having seen anything about setting the initial seeds, but relying on a previous test to set a seed isn't a good idea - you'd always have to ensure that no tests were ever added or changed in-between that ever used random state or everything would get lost. We could fix the random seed for any test which uses random methods with a fixture to get around that. I actually think this is a true failure; the default solver `rtol = 1e-6`, but here we're using `rtol=1e-7` as the test, so the test is bugged (it's probably not the only one, and I may have missed some of these in `mcsolve` too).

Testability,"I'm not at all a fan of making tests part of the public interface like this. It's something that we make absolutely no stability guarantees about, and coupling downstream packages to our own tests just sounds like a recipe for disaster - if we find a bug in main QuTiP and need to change tests or add methods (which we should be able to do completely freely), we're going to inject a ton of extra code into downstream packages, and may completely break them. To be honest, I'm not even wild about how we distribute our tests as part of the module code at all, but that's what we've got. It _could_ be ok if you import the test case base, and redefine your tests from there. We still don't make any stability guarantees about that, but it's conceivable that we could (though of course, the problem of ""what if we need to add methods"" persists). That would also solve your problems about saying you can't import individual tests.

Testability,"I'm not sure about that, for two reasons. First, `super_tensor` doesn't implement a tensor product but a useful combination of reshuffling and the tensor product that, so calling it `tensor` alone may result in confusion when trying to match to the mathematics of papers and lecture notes which use the tensor product more literally. Second, it's a pretty significant break with previous behavior, such that if someone has implemented reshuffling themselves, that would then stop working if `tensor()` dispatches based on `is_super`. As an alternative, maybe some new function with a name like `composite()` that calls `tensor()` or `super_tensor()` respectively? That way, you're referring to the logical act of compositing two systems together, rather than to the mathematics behind it, and could leave code invariant when changing from unitaries to CPTP maps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-57070065:698,log,logical,698,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-57070065,1,['log'],['logical']
Testability,"I'm not sure solution 3 will work as easily as this - if the user's `scipy.linalg.eigh` is broken, then calling it doesn't help, surely?. Also, I can reproduce the segfaults with both `np.ascontiguousarray` and `np.asfortranarray` on my machine, but it is a size of 64 that seems to reliably do me in. Script to reproduce:; ```python; import numpy as np; from scipy.linalg import eigh. def random_hermitian(n):; h = np.random.rand(n, n) + 1j*np.random.rand(n, n); return h + np.conj(h.T). for n in range(1, 101):; print(n); for _ in [None]*100:; x = eigh(np.ascontiguousarray(random_hermitian(n))); ```; and this segfaults on `n=64` reliably with the `pip` version of `scipy` (linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.7), and always succeeds with the `conda` version (linked against MKL 2019.4). Both `scipy` versions are 1.4.1 here. I did the most bare-bones install to test this:; ```; $ conda create -n blastest python; $ conda activate blastest; $ pip install scipy; $ python blas.py; ```; where `blas.py` is the repro script above. Doing this, `pip` pulls me OpenBLAS 0.3.7. Looking at the source of OpenBLAS, the whole heavy-lifting implementation is in Fortran - there's the classic LAPACKe C wrapper around the core Fortran LAPACK, but everything eventually goes down to the Fortran. If it helps, it's an out-of-bounds access error that causes the segfault for me, and the address it's trying to access doesn't look like dummy nonsense (`0x101b95010`). I'm pretty sure it's a nasty Mac/OpenBLAS bug. If the problem is particularly in `zheevr` we could swap the call to `eig` (instead of `eigh`) for Mac only, which should hopefully sidestep the problem, because it'll call `zgeev` instead. All recent pip installs of `scipy` link against OpenBLAS, so there's not much that can sidestep it there, other than mandating `conda` usage, because you can't relink `scipy` to decent libraries without compiling from source.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955:858,test,test,858,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"I'm sorry I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment, but just to add an extra point (that it looks like I didn't think about before): if we _do_ add this, then any method that requires an unconditional `import qutip` in downstream packages probably isn't a suitable solution - `import qutip` already takes far too long (though a lot of this is importing various parts of `scipy`, which another library might do on our behalf), and it means that they'd have to do their own import checking to handle optional dependencies. In that sense, (ab)using Python's duck-typing with a magic method might be the best way to break the dependency/import problem. I'm definitely still against implicit conversion to `Qobj` in pretty much any situation - I can imagine we could define a safe, fairly forward-compatible interface for letting people do `qutip.Qobj(x)`, but as it stands, that's the limit that I'd want the interface to be used for. I particularly am really against the idea of implicit conversion. I don't see an advantage to allowing QuTiP functions to act implicitly on other objects; it means our own functions are slower (because we have to explicitly test inputs on _everything_), and it restricts us more from improving `Qobj`'s internals, because we have to maintain compatibility with the interface. We'd never really be able to output anything _other_ than a `Qobj` without this, so there's no reason not to just have the user convert the inputs to `Qobj` explicitly themselves - that isolates the efficiency penalty so you only pay it if you need it, and it'll likely be clearer in the end anyway, because explicit is better for following the logic than implicit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301:1163,test,test,1163,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"

Testability,"I'm very surprised to see that there is a failing test on qutip.qip, which is pure python and is unlikely to be platform dependent. I have a guess that this one may have something to do with pytest parameterization. I had a problem with that on Mac OS (not M1) before, which I still don't fully understand and I left a comment back then:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/3ff3f42d2cd950c99af8936b12d9221ed79de5e3/qutip/tests/test_scheduler.py#L92-L94; If I split the test and run them (`test_scheduling_gates2` and `test_scheduling_gates3`) one by one, it is fine. But if I use pytest parameterization to initialize several of them, it fails. And now this time it happens at exactly the same place. If you would like to, you can copy that failing test and run it (without using pytest parameterization but giving the input explicitly) in a Python console.

Testability,"I'm wondering whether setting `auto_tidyup` per data type is a good idea? One expects the mathematical operations performed by different data backends to give the same results but setting `auto_tidyup` to `[""CSR""]` by default will break that assumption quite badly. For example, matrices might become singular when sparse and not when dense. There is also a danger of making some benchmarks artificially fast. If we're going to compare backends, we should probably look at both backends with tidyup on or off. Is there a reason that tidyup cannot just be specialized for the new backends that need it?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881301573:380,benchmark,benchmarks,380,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881301573,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']
Testability,"I've been playing around with larger systems recently; when I started out ptrace had a memory issue and couldn't handle what I was doing, so I had written a home-made version to do it. Recently I ended up doing the ptrace with the fixed built-in function and I found it to be much slower. I did some testing with my new function. At least on the machine I'm running on, with 9+ qubits it's about 10x faster for calculating a partial trace on a density matrix. If you're starting out with a ket, you can go even faster, an additional 5x improvement: (test code below); ```; Running time (ms/trace); 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 qubits; ptrace (dm) 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.6 1.9 6.6 33.4 137.9; new func (dm) 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.7 1.0 2.8 13.1 ; ptrace (ket) 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.9 2.7 8.5 37.2 167.7; new func (ket) 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.0 3.2 ; sum((rho-rho).norm()); dm 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; ket 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; ```. My new version is pretty simple, using numpy's built-in ndarray routines. I've looked at the code for ptrace and it's a bit opaque to me; at the moment I don't feel quite up to modifying it, so I'm just putting up the code I've used instead of doing a pull request. My new function is here:; ```; def ptracealt(rho,qkeep) :; rd = rho.dims[0]; nd = len(rd); qkeep = list(sort(qkeep)); dkeep = (np.array(rd)[qkeep]).tolist(); qtrace = list(set(np.arange(nd))-set(qkeep)); dtrace = (np.array(rd)[qtrace]).tolist(); if isket(rho) :; vmat = (rho.full(); .reshape(rd); .transpose(qkeep+qtrace); .reshape([prod(dkeep),prod(dtrace)])); rhomat = vmat.dot(vmat.conj().T); else :; rhomat = np.trace(rho.full(); .reshape(rd+rd); .transpose(qtrace+[nd+q for q in qtrace]+qkeep+[nd+q for q in qkeep]); .reshape([prod(dtrace),prod(dtrace),prod(dkeep),prod(dkeep)])); return Qobj(rhomat,dims=[dkeep, dkeep]); ```; and the test code here: ; ```; Nqmax=10; ntest = 100; trdiff = np.zeros([2,Nqmax-1]); ttr = np.zeros([4,Nqmax-1]); for nd in range(2,Nqmax+1) :; r0 = [ rand_d",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1076:300,test,testing,300,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1076,2,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"
Testability,"I've been thinking about how this interacts with our build and test infrastructure, and I'm writing some of those thoughts here partly for myself:. - We currently build with oldest-supported-numpy, and we want to keep that because which is the earliest supported numpy varies by Python version and operating system and changes over time, so it's good if someone else worries about that for us. - We require for installation currently numpy >= 1.16.6 and that is probably what we want to update to match the NEP. There is a question here of whether we should specify our minimum supported numpy in ""install_requires"" in ""setup.cfg"" or not. - The majority of our test matrix should *build* qutip with oldest-supported-numpy to match what we distribute. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest numpy we require (i.e. oldest NEP) and one for the most recent (i.e. latest numpy). . - We should include at least one test run for the oldest Python we support and one for the newest. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest SciPy we support and one for the newest. - The NEP doesn't say anything about SciPy, but I propose we select the oldest SciPy that supports our oldest NEP numpy.

Testability,"I've done some simple benchmarks and indeed there seems to be a nice speedup. http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jrjohansson/e63daeb3a41f95f163ad. so it definitely seems worthwhile to add support for this type of time-dependence in QuTiP. But string part of the definition of H is your example can be automatically generated knowning the times array, as I did in the notebook linked above. Therefore, I wonder if it may not be even more convenient if one simply could do. ```; >>> H = [H1, [H2, pulse]]; ```.

Don't worry about the random test failure you got in a pickle test one time - that wasn't your fault and we know about it and have fixed it for the next major release of QuTiP already. Also don't worry about the speed of the CI tests. You can't reliably benchmark by comparing CI runs because you never know what else was running on the physical hardware at the same time.

Testability,"If it helps in the future, you can use `pycodestyle` (available in `pip` and `conda`) to check pep8 compliance on your end before pushing a commit. As to the actual command, we might not actually want to remove the usage of `convert` - it's quite possible that a lot of people are still using ImageMagick 6, since for most people it's just a dependency that got installed by something else, and isn't frequently updated. `qutip` doesn't list it as an official dependency, so it wouldn't get updated on our behalf. We could catch which version of `ImageMagick` to use with something like; ```python; def _magick_comamnd():; for command in ['magick', 'convert']:; try:; subprocess.run((command, '--version'), capture_output=True); return command; except OSError:; pass; raise FileNotFoundError(""Couldn't locate system ImageMagick""); ```; and cache the result on import (below into the variable `_magick`).

Testability,"If it's something we want to support, we'll need a bit of a rewrite of the data-layer testing infrastructure, but nothing too major. I'd be in favour of a bit of a larger restructure:; - rearrange the repo root to have `/src/qutip` and `/test/qutip` instead of `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---.

Testability,"If the initial state was found to be of type 'oper', no further testing was done in initialisation of mesolve on the dimensions. For example, if a user incorrectly created a density matrix, such as by doing; ```python; tensor(basis(20, 0), qeye(20)/20); ```; (presumably intending `basis(20, 0).proj()` or similar), it would have a type of 'oper' inside Qobj, and mesolve would recognise it as a ""proper"" density matrix, even though the shape was actually incorrect. Such an object would get passed down into the C layer, which does no shape checking, without having its shape explicitly tested, and eventually could cause a segfault in the matrix multiplication routine. The correct check in this setup is to test the shapes when passed into `mesolve`, if this is possible. If the Hamiltonian/Liouvillian is generated by a Python callable, we have to test every time the time-dependence function is called.

However, this is not a desired behaviour of a module to do like this: importing qutip shouldn't impose that numpy is imported in any particular way (even though qutip uses numpy internally). For example, if a user prefer to import numpy as `np`, then it is pointless that qutip exposes numpy as `numpy` as well. It because even weirder when an import pattern like `import qutip as q` is used, because as it is now then numpy is available through `q.numpy`, which is unnecessary and causes problem with for example nose unit testing of qutip module (because it finds numpy and run all numpy tests as well) and also with module autocompletion in for example spyder and ipython.

Testability,"If you click into ""Files changed"" you can just tick the files as you've looked at them. To make it easier for you, I'd suggest having a copy of the old version next to them and reading the full commit message, because I usually explain what I'm doing in them and why I'm doing it that way.

Testability,"In #1332 there is a huge drop in reported test coverage by Coveralls. This is because large tracts of the most-tested Python files were either severely reduced in length, or converted to Cython files, and it seems that Coveralls does not correctly handle Cython; it reports the existence of a `x.py` file for every `x.pyx` file that exists, with the `.py` file having 7 lines, all of which are apparently untested. The new data-layer types _are_ tested albeit not as completely as they will be once they're finished, but Coveralls has reported a huge drop in coverage. I don't know if any coverage estimators exist for Cython (I would expect not due to their compiled nature), but it's perhaps something we should consider. Also, Coveralls counts the test files as part of its coverage indicator. By my rough count, there are 42,223 SLOC in `qutip` (i.e. excluding comments and whitespace but unfortunately including docstrings), of which 11,259 are in `qutip/tests`. Aside from a couple of skipped tests, 100% of the lines in `qutip/tests` will be run, so if we produce a modified coverage report, having 61% of the SLOC covered in _all_ of `qutip` is equivalent to; ```python; >>> (0.61*42_223 - 1.00*11_259) / (42_223 - 11_259); 0.4681898; ```; **46.8% true coverage**.

This transpired to be because `coverage.py` wasn't able to find our `.coveragerc` file correctly when `pytest` was called in the manner it is on Travis. This PR then does a couple of things:; 1. correctly locates the `.coveragerc` file; 2. excludes the Cython bootstrapping code from being part of the coverage; 3. correctly locates the pytest configuration file `pytest.ini` (although now we have a `pyproject.toml`, we could move that configuration there); 4. completely reorganises `.travis.yml` to remove dead configs, properly share common setups, and generally make it a bit easier to read and see what's going on; 5. fixes file reporting in Coveralls (look at the ""tree"" tab in the Coveralls web report compared to the current `master`); you can now click on the files and get proper line-by-line detail on what was covered and what wasn't, e.g. [here's the report for `mcsolve.py`](https://coveralls.io/builds/32982136/source?filename=qutip/mcsolve.py).

I might return to the Cython elements to see how much of them when _can_ reasonably do coverage analysis on. My prediction about actual test coverage dropping once the test files are correctly omitted, which I mentioned in #1339, came true though not _quite_ as cataclysmically (`coverage.py` uses statements, not SLOC as its metric); coverage drops from ~71% to ~63%.

Testability,"In certain cases in matrices containing values smaller than the tolerance for Hermicity, a matrix can be considered Hermitian even if its transpose does not have the same sparsity pattern as itself. The previous version of this function would give false negatives in these circumstances, whereas now we fall back on the more computationally and memory intensive version of constructing the transpose completely, and comparing element-wise. We offset some of this slowdown by optimising the floating-point comparisons to avoid calls to `sqrt` (via `abs`), and by removing a redundant test of the sparsity pattern in the inner loop. Fixes #1350 for the `master` branch, but still to do for `dev.major`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1352:583,test,test,583,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1352,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"In certain circumstances, `zcsr_isherm` can give a `False` negative. This is usually masked by the `auto_tidyup` option being turned on.

This happens when a small non-zero value (lower than the tolerance) is compared to a zero. This is because the structure test in `zcsr_isherm` assumes that for Hermicity to hold, there _must_ always be an explicitly stored corresponding element for each entry, however clearly this isn't always the case. It hasn't appeared before because we always have `auto_tidyup` turned on with a sufficiently large tolerance that these values would be removed by almost all operations which could have introduced this disparity (mostly matrix multiplication).

Testability,"In general in pytest we use the bare keyword `assert` for almost everything. All the functions in `np.testing` are from the ""before times"", when test tooling wasn't as good as it is nowadays - they were a big improvement on available warning messages back before 2015. Nowadays, though, `pytest` does introspection on assertion failures, so it has even better message reporting than the `np.testing` functions, and it lets you write much clearer code. For example, `assert_equal(x, y)` is much better spelled in pytest as `assert x == y`, because it's much faster to read and pytest does better error reporting for it. Similarly, testing for exceptions is better with; ```python; with pytest.raises(ValueError):; call_that_raises(1, ""hello, world""); ```; as opposed to the numpy form `np.testing.assert_raises(ValueError, call_that_raises, 1, ""hello, world"")` - the pytest one is much easier to read, and the error message is better. The only numpy one we still use is `np.testing.assert_allclose` when we're comparing several numpy arrays. That's just because `pytest` doesn't have a good function that's aware of multidimensional arrays (at least not one that I know). This file still has a load of old numpy testing code in it (e.g. `np.testing.assert_equal`) because it was written quite a long time ago, when that was the recommended way of doing things. We're changing over slowly, so we can take advantage of all the nice features of pytest. In this case, I changed `np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y, atol=tol)` to `assert abs(x - y) < tol`. I removed `np.testing.assert_allclose`, because that gives the mistaken impression that we're comparing arrays (we're not, we're comparing two scalars). I could have changed it to `assert x == pytest.approx(y, tol=tol)`, except in this case the test file hasn't been converted to `pytest` style yet, and I wanted to keep the total change of this PR as small as possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671:46,assert,assert,46,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671,16,"['assert', 'test']","['assert', 'assertion', 'test', 'testing']"
Testability,"In general the biggest thing you should consider is readability, and to be fair, that's a little subjective. You're welcome to comment on my PR if you think I've done anything that's unreadable. You can scope fixtures at whatever level is appropriate. In this particular case, I scoped the `dimension` fixture at the module level, because there's loads of places that needed to test varying dimensions, and it's very convenient to define it just once. In the few cases where we needed to override that (e.g. in `dnorm`), I overrode it by providing a definition in a tighter scope - either at class level or per-function (via `pytest.mark.parametrize` directly). The correct scoping just depends a lot on the type of tests you're writing - if you're going to have to overwrite something constantly then module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation.

Testability,"It seems to work now (the failing test is unrelated). I will briefly summarize what I found out and changed. Setting up and using an MPI environment is surprisingly difficult, and I don't think it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:34,test,test,34,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"It would be good to understand why the qutip-qip test started failing now. Perhaps it is related to the new specializations for dense that were merged on Friday? Previously some operations that went via the sparse data layer may have been tidied up and now they are not. The use of `p != 0` existed in version 4 and is, I think, correct in this particular case. If a POVM is supplied as a list of operators, and some of those operators have zero probability, then one cannot provide a normalized final density matrix, but one still needs to return a value to the user, since they specifically asked about that POVM. Perhaps qutip-qip could apply a tolerance itself on the returned probabilities?. We could also add an atol parameter to some measurement functions for v5, but I think that ship has sailed for 4.7.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2029#issuecomment-1336427119:49,test,test,49,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2029#issuecomment-1336427119,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"It would maybe be good to keep everything in one PR that can be squashed into a single commit at the end - this is only a single ""logical"" change at the end of the day. Nice to get these things tidied up. You probably need to run all the tests locally before just pushing to check if everything works; QuTiP has quite a few code generation steps and indirect evaluation that can't be detected with static analysis, which is why you're seeing a lot of test failures (though that's _mostly_ `.pyx` files). Something seems wrong with the static analyser if it's not spotting that `Qobj` is used _everywhere_, though, and I notice in several commits it has a lot of false positives for removal. I can't imagine any situation where a static analyser should remove an in-library import from an `__init__.py` file, but it's done that in a couple of places.

Testability,"Just that we also have '_noise_direct()' which does a bit of linear algebra to avoid using the pseudo-inverse. i think it can be a bit more numerically efficient than mucking around with the inverse itself. Maybe doing the pseudo-inverse tends to involve a big large dense matrix, and this avoids it?. iirc, the logic of noise_direct is, since we write the pseudo-inverse like $R=QL^{-1}Q$, the annoying term we have to evaluate in the noise expression is something like:. $$y = I QL^{-1} Q I \rho. $$. so we substitute, for the last few terms. $$x = L^{-1} QI\rho $$. we multiply from the left by L, to get. $$L x = Q I \rho$$. and we can find x using a scipy's solve or something equivalent, and then find y with. $$y = IQ x$$. In the skewness you have this new term,. $$y =I R R I P I \rho$$. which is a bit clunky to manipulate.; maybe we can write something like. $$x = L^{-1}QIPI \rho$$. and again, multiplying by L. $$Lx = QIPI \rho$$. to get x, then the original expression is now. $$y = IQL^{-1}QQx$$. defining a new variable. $$t = L^{-1}QQx$$. we can again, multiply by L. $$Lt = QQx$$,. solve for t, then we get . $$y= IQ t$$. ? i probably made a mistake, so take with a grain of salt!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2138882230:312,log,logic,312,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2138882230,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Looks like a reasonable and practical solution to me. Regarding the logging system in qutip, I think that it also would be worth making some changes to how it is used. As it is now, qutip does not really use the Python logging system in the way it is intended. The best way to use it would be to have each submodule that use logging use something like:. ```; import logging; logger = logging.getLogger(__name__); ```. and then log at different levels using the logger instance, for example. ```; logger.debug(""debug msg""); ```. or. ```; logger.warning(""warning msg""); ```. etc. The only utilities that would be required in qutip.logging_utils would then be to optionally create a stream or file handler for the ""qutip"" package or any of its submodules. This would allow selectively tuning logging for different submodules if requried, and there we not be any need for checking if qutip.settings.debug is set or to set logging levels explicitly in any submodules (as currently in done in the steadystate module for example).

Testability,"Makes sense, thank your for the explanation Eric! While trying to set a sensible value for `tol` I got the problem that 3% of the times the tests fail independently of the `tol` value. This is because the numpy function returns `nan` whereas `trace_csr` does not. To replicate the problem I used the following code:; ```python; import qutip; import scipy; import numpy as np; from qutip.tests.core.data import conftest. # Catch one of those matrices that return nan in the nuclear norm; for i in range(100):; matrix_csr = conftest.random_csr((100,100), 0.001, True); matrix = matrix_csr.to_array() ; result = np.linalg.norm(matrix, 'nuc'). # If it is nan store the matrix for analysis.; if np.isnan(result):; print('got one of those tricky matrices'); nan_matrix = matrix ; nan_matrix_csr = matrix_csr; ; # Scipy's and numpys methods return nan; sc_norm = scipy.linalg.norm(nan_matrix, 'nuc'); print(f'SciPy linalgn nuc norm: {sc_norm}'). np_norm = np.linalg.norm(nan_matrix, 'nuc'); print(f'NumPy linalgn nuc norm: {np_norm}'). # Using svd wich is similar to what numpy/scipy should be doing; u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(nan_matrix); print(f'SVD method: {s.sum()}'). # Qutip sparse method; print(f'QuTiP trace_csr:{qutip.data.norm.trace_csr(nan_matrix_csr)}'). # This prints; # SciPy linalgn nuc norm: nan; # NumPy linalgn nuc norm: nan; # SVD method: 6.456744360029763; # QuTiP trace_csr:6.456744366739419; ```. As you can see in the above code, it fails to compute a value for NumPy/SciPy but not for a direct method (SVD) or the QuTiP method (which is different to the SVD method but still works). @Ericgig, do you get the same results? They look quite weird and I wonder if I am doing something wrong or whether this is a NumPy/SciPy bug. ```; np.__version__='1.21.2'; qutip.__version__='5.0.0.dev0+7a90dbd'; scipy.__version__='1.7.0'; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1635#issuecomment-930224872:140,test,tests,140,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1635#issuecomment-930224872,2,['test'],['tests']

OpenMP is ignored for now as low-priority. We'll need to get it working before a QuTiP 5.0 release, but I'm not working on it at the moment. `CQobjEvo` has been absolutely stripped bare. All its variants are gone, since the data layer types will handle this instead. `QobjEvo` is basically managed by shim at the moment, and needs a huge tidy up to bring it up to speed with the new data layer, and keep it maintainable. The data layer types have been taught to pickle themselves safely and automatically, and so consequently `QobjEvo` is magically pickle-able (aside from the OpenMP types).

Testability,"Not to discourage you from contributing, but there's already been some movement on #1208 in #1209.

But yes, any changes to that should be in a new PR, because it's a different logical unit of work. There's some movement on that too (e.g. #1181). About pep8 changes: I'm not a maintainer, but it might be a good idea to be conservative about changing actual public APIs in the name of pep8. Changing public APIs that work fine means the users, who are the reason we're writing the code in the first place, have to adjust, and the pep8 spec explicitly warns against breaking backwards compatibility to match the pep. `N` is fairly consistent within `qutip` for the number of qubits, and the `U` in `U_list` refers to unitary matrices, which are conventionally a capital `U` in mathematical writing.

Testability,"Note: in theory you can install QuTiP from the test PyPI server right now by doing; ```; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; ```; (that's just the name - you still do `import qutip`) but since it's on the ""wrong"" server, you first have to manually install `numpy` and `scipy`. When it's released properly on PyPI it'll handle the dependencies correctly - this is only an artifact of being on the testing server. Running that command will install a binary version with no compilation, and should work on any (reasonable) Linux machine, Mac (possibly not M1 chips) and Windows. It's possible you may get an error about `ndarray size changed ... this may indicate binary incompatibility` - if so, either force `numpy` up to the new 1.20 or down to 1.19 (whichever one you don't have). This was a breaking change in numpy 1.20. Per my reading of the release notes, it won't be an issue provided in the future we always build against `numpy>=1.20` (even when using lower `numpy` at runtime) because the new version updates a certain C-API macro to take into account the possibility of runtime variability. I have pushed an additional change to the build requirements to ensure this always happens. This has another knock-on effect: numpy 1.20 only supports Python 3.7+ (released June 2017). Currently, officially QuTiP supports Python 3.6, but I think it's reasonable to follow numpy's footsteps and **drop support for python 3.6 from qutip 5.0**. It's offset by gaining support for 3.9.

Testability,"Numpy 1.20 officially deprecated use of `np.int` and other things like `np.complex`. These were just thin aliases to Python types anyway, so that replacement is safe. Swap `float` and `complex` to `np.float64` and `np.complex128`; these still match Python precision (and standard double-precision floats), but more importantly we assume at all points in Cython code that we're dealing with double-precision arithmetic. Anything else would be a larger problem for us. In cases where `np.int` was used as a type check, we actually care more about checking for Integral typing, rather than specifically the int class; super weird constructs like; ```python; isinstance(np.int64(1), int) == False; ```; so taking indices out of an ndarry may lead to incorrect results when this sort of test is used. Better to use the abstract; ```python; isinstance(..., numbers.Integral); ```.

Testability,"Oh, I completely agree with the argument nested loops/if/else. I was more talking about the logistic depth requirement (edit: wrong again, it is called Cognitive Complexity) of code climate. I just realized that is not the climate issue here. But, anyway, indeed `circuit.py` is quite messy. And the Gate class is more or less just a place holder. A refactoring to define each gate as a subclass should make things much easier. Also for this latex method. I like it very much what is going on in `dev.major`!. Tbh the millions of `_gate_resolved` functions are actually already after a short refactoring last year by a brave volunteer. It used to be 400-line functions. That was horrible. Just like the `adjacent_gates` method in `spinchain.py` (another F). I haven't dared to touch it... > For say qobj.py, the master version has maintainability F, while `dev.major` has maintainability A with the only issues being TODOs and like 5 pep8s. That's amazing!

Thus, had to move to the Trusty build stack. 2) Although it took forever to hunt down, it appears that when .pyx files are included as package data, Py27 may try to rebuild them upon calling **init**.

Testability,"Ok, it turns out I got the numpy release notes the wrong way round; we have to build our binaries with `1.16.6 <= numpy < 1.20` to maintain ABI compatibility no matter the numpy version. I have updated the compiler infrastructure to take this into account - this is in some ways a temporary restriction until two or three years in the future when we can drop support for all numpy versions less than 1.20. This is ready for final review. If you're fast, you can also try installing from the test PyPI server to see if the wheels work for you. While it's on the temporary server, you need to install `numpy` and `scipy` manually yourself (as they don't exist on test.pypi.org), but pip will do the dependencies correctly for you once it's publishing to the full repo.; ```bash; conda create -n pypi-test; conda install python pip numpy scipy; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; python -c 'import qutip; qutip.about()'; ```. @hodgestar, @nathanshammah: perhaps you could just glance over this again and make sure everything looks right to you? Simon, I know you already looked over it once, so if you've not got time again, no problem - barely anything has changed since you last saw it. Nathan: in theory once we're in a position where deployments push to PyPI I think I can write an action for qutip/qutip.github.io to push a commit updating the website with the new information too. However, with the docs currently using a completely separate build process in a different repo, they can't really be triggered by a release here.

Testability,"Ok, so I did some benchmarking at https://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/06_example_3states_benchmark.ipynb ([gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf)), based on [one of the example notebooks from the Krotov package](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/06_example_3states.html). I'll be referring to the numbered cells in that notebook in the discussion below. @jakelishman in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859873615:. > I think you might be able to achieve a lot of what you want already. The pseudo-code looks like it's not using `mesolve` super efficiently, though maybe it's only because of simplifications to make a MWE. For example, if your controls are piecewise constant, then it might be inefficient to represent those terms as ""time dependent""; doing so means you incur the cost of multiplying each term by a scalar at every intermediate step the integrator chooses to take, then you have to perform the matrix-vector product for each one individually and add them up. That's certainly worth trying: when calling `mesolve` in a loop over the time grid, I did indeed see a significant speedup when summing the Lindbladian into a single constant `Qobj`, see `In [21]` vs `In [24]`. On the other hand, it doesn't always give a speedup: in the low-level [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) it actually makes the propagation slower, see `In [29]` vs `In [32]`. It's a bit surprising, but then, as you say:. > [...] This isn't guaranteed, because it involves copying rather more data _before_ the call. So that's ok. > Would something like this work for you? [...]; >; > By giving `mesolve` the Liouvillian instead of the Hamiltonian and collapse operators separately.

Testability,"Ok, yeah, I definitely see the use-case here. I'll leave it removed from `matmul` for the time being because I hadn't really organised that code to allow safe calling of the function with an `out` parameter, but I'll look to re-instate it, similarly with `add`. For `add`: I envisage a nice possibility for `QobjEvo` using `CSR` backing along the vein of `CQobjEvoTdMatched`: on instantiation we add together all the matrices, then we `memset` all zeroes along the `data` array and store it as `self._structure`. Then each time we `__call__` the object, we simply do `out = self._structure.copy()`, and use that as the output matrix, because we guarantee we'll always have enough space and the correct structure. There's a couple of minor kinks in the logic of `add_csr` that we might have to iron out in order to avoid an additional matrix addition, but the savings in memory allocation could be good. You're absolutely right about the `pxd` files - I haven't taken enough care to make sure they've got all the definitions in yet.

Testability,"On the `test_dqd_current()` test: it appears that the problem is with the element 14 in the `eps_vec`. I did some more checking with different values for `eps_vec`, and there are other values which give problems, you can see the code below. . I defined a function that returns the values for a given value of `eps`:. ```python; def current_noise_eps(eps):; H = (eps/2 * sz + tc * sx); L = qutip.liouvillian(H, c_ops); rhoss = qutip.steadystate(L); current, noise = qutip.countstat_current_noise(L, [],; rhoss=rhoss,; J_ops=J_ops). current2 = qutip.countstat_current(L, rhoss=rhoss, J_ops=J_ops); assert abs(current - current2) < 1e-8. current2 = qutip.countstat_current(L, c_ops, J_ops=J_ops); assert abs(current - current2) < 1e-8. current_target = (tc**2 * GammaR; / (tc**2 * (2+GammaR/GammaL) + GammaR**2/4 + eps**2)); noise_target = current_target * (; 1 - (8*GammaL*tc**2*(4 * eps**2 * (GammaR - GammaL); + GammaR*(3*GammaL*GammaR + GammaR**2 + 8*tc**2)); / (4*tc**2*(2*GammaL + GammaR) + GammaL*GammaR**2; + 4*eps**2*GammaL)**2); ). return current.flatten()[0], current_target, noise.flatten()[0], noise_target, rhoss; ```. Now I have the following:. ```; >>> res = current_noise_eps(1.04); >>> print(res[2:4]); (0.06374906663351243, 0.0011104778081249154); ```. So the `noise` is quite different from `noise_target`.

The way it stands, it also depends on [Eigen C++ header library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), but it should be easy to remove this dependency as it is only used to specify the input matrices. Other minor dependencies are easily removed. I'm not sure what underlying mechanism you use in QuTiP, but it should be relatively straightforward to reformat the whole class into a C implementation with only SCS as a dependency. Unfortunately the python `scs` package does not install C headers, so that dependency might turn out to be something to worry about. Perhaps SCS itself can be integrated in the QuTiP source?.

Testability,"QuTiP is currently incompatible with numpy 1.20. Tests will fail to even collect with an error such as; ```; AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'dag'; ```; and a lot of functionality will break - anything that requires `Qobj.eigenstates()` for example. This is because `Qobj` defines `__array__`, one of numpy's ""array interface"" functions, intended for classes that can be safely converted _implicitly_ into an `ndarray`. This isn't really the case for `Qobj` - it loses all sorts of information when you do that, which is why we've maintained the separate `Qobj.full()` for explicitly getting the dense matrix representation of a `Qobj`. This is not to mention that numpy ufuncs probably should not be able to implicitly convert `Qobj` - I'd strongly argue that `np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1))` should be `TypeError`, _not_ `array([[0. +0.j], [0.84147098+0.j]])` (like it is right now). We actually already removed this ""functionality"" in `dev.major`. The most pressing incompatibility is that a few points in QuTiP put a few `Qobj` into a `np.array(dtype=object)`. In numpy 1.20, this no longer produces a 1D array of `Qobj`, but a 3D array of complex. This breaks `Qobj.eigenstates`, and prevents test collection due to it being present in `states.py::qutrit_basis()`, which is called during parametrisation. There are a two possible ways to solve this, and we ought to release a fix with one of them in a patch ASAP:; 1. remove `Qobj.__array__`; 2. remove all use of `Qobj` in `np.array`. I'm personally in favour of ""explicit is better than implicit"" in this case, i.e. removing `Qobj.__array__` and relying on `Qobj.full()`. As another example along this vein, note `scipy.sparse` matrices don't implement this either, and they're arguably closer to being safely coerced to `ndarray` than we are. ### Related issues. #938: feature request for implementing `__array__`. This only asks for `np.array(qobj)` as a convenience, acknowledging the availability of `Qobj.full()`.; #1017",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433:49,Test,Tests,49,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433,1,['Test'],['Tests']
Testability,"Questions / doubt I still have is about making the `default` mandatory for states.; At first I wanted to pass `qzeros` with the dims fetched from those of the `QobjEvo`, but sometime we need to use the args first to get the QobjEvo's dimensions...

The integral to solve reads as:. $$ \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T dt e^{-ik\Omega t} f(t) $$. where $k \in \[-k_{max}, k_{max} \]$ and $f(t)$ is a $T$-periodic function.

But the solver tolerance is for the state itself, not expectation values and other scalars obtained from them. The test is not to check numerical error.

Testability,"Repeating just changes the probability of failure, rather than actually detecting whether it was a rare fail, and `mesolve` tests aren't always the fastest, so repetition here isn't great. For simple unitary qubit operations, I think it should be easy enough to work out how the tolerance translates. It's difficult to say that if there's a numerical error then the error will be much greater - I caught some errors in the `test_gates.py` (I think) that were sneaking through because the tolerances were set too high. It's probably best to keep as tight a tolerance as is reasonable - here I think `2 * qutip.Options.rtol` would always be correct if the numerics are.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1249#issuecomment-625344751:124,test,tests,124,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1249#issuecomment-625344751,1,['test'],['tests']

Of course I understand that the message is technically correct, and we could work around the problem in `krotov`, but it was nice to be able to use `mesolve` as a catch-all for either a Schrödinger equation or a master equation. We'd have to start routing different cases to `mesolve` and `sesolve` manually, otherwise.

Testability,"So I pushed two commits here - one which makes the changes to `setup.py`, and another which doesn't just remove the commented reference to `nose`, it completely overhauls `test_qobj.py` into a more `pytest`-friendly format. I found that removing the comment would have left a very odd function that was used to decorate test cases, which isn't necessary in `pytest` so much because you can use parametrisation, more description function names, and grouping in `Test*` classes to achieve the same goal with less custom wrappers. Once I was on that, I kind of got carried away changing the rest of the file. Let me know if that's too much - I could rebase this PR (and resubmit it) to split up the commits if you'd rather, or I can I just remove that last commit which makes all those changes.

Testability,"Solvers: absolutely the solvers should always be packaged with the main `qutip`. I had sort of envisaged that we'd put them in a `solve` package, which would be exported into the main namespace just like `core` is. This way is more just for greater separation, so that the full core isn't entangled with the solvers themselves - I think separating them like this will help us ensure that we specify the data layer API much more cleanly if the solvers aren't referenced within it. (i.e. there's no reference to any solver within `core`, but the API is built sufficiently cleanly that they can still access all the internals). OpenMP check: I think there's two neater ways:; 1. perhaps `settings` should just be in `core` too? I avoided putting the check in `core/__init__.py` because I'm really trying to avoid bi-directional dependencies between the packages, but moving `settings.py` into `core` would solve that.; 2. alternatively, we could just write `settings.py` as part of `setup.py` - determine whether we built against OpenMP/MKL at compile-time, and then just write it in? We can still choose whether or not to use it in various runtime situations. As for the current test - yeah, the comparative complexity is kind of indicative that this isn't the right way to do it. It's a relatively straightforward use of `importlib`, but still it's more difficult.

Testability,"Sorry for such a long delay... @QuantumFall This issue somehow escaped from my email list and I never noticed it. This is actually a situation often encountered when testing just one gate. If Hamiltonian acts trivially on the state for a few time steps, the adaptive solver may decide on a step size so large that all the reaming pulses are skipped. Set the max step size fixes it:; ```python; options = qutip.Options(max_step=0.05); processor_state = processor.run_state(init_state, options=options).states[-1].tidyup(1.0e-6); ```. Usually, this is because the Hamiltonian is 0 at the first few steps. This example is actually slightly different. The first pulse is a non-trivial (sxsx+sysy) (swap-like). Maybe it is because it has no effect on the initial state `(0,0,0,1)`. But `(1,0,0,0)` seems to work well. It seems really necessary to adaptively choose a step size for the simulators.

Testability,"Sorry, I made some mistakes in my previous post, and you are right on the paper. I think I can summarize the two MC simulation strategies into two kinds: one is that we generate a random number at each time step, and then compare it with the jumping probability (**1-P(no jump)**), and decide which jump to make using the jumping operators; the other one is that we generate a random number, and let it to be the no-jumping probability, and let the system evolve until it ends at the so-called waiting time by judging if the probability of no-jumping reaches the generated random number, and then decide which state to jump. My hope is that our mcsolve function can allow users to choose which strategy to employ in the simulation, as both of the strategies are valuable for different purposes, as I have claimed in my earlier thread. This is the feature I am looking for. Is that feasible and reasonable? . I read over the mcsolve code a little bit. From my understanding, the core algorithm of the MC simulation is in the ODE's single-trajectory definition part (_mc_alg_evolve...). Looks like the code is applying the second strategy I mentioned before. But I am not totally sure, as I am confused and got lost on many variables. Like, what does the RHS of the ODE mean? How comes the **array[1, 10, 11]**? ... . At this stage, I have to resort to the original author of the code, and would like to hear your opinions and detailed guidelines.

Testability,"Sorry, my holidays were not that long... Here are some tests of the proposed modifications. 1 ) Computation of the weight; The proposed modification may lead to a large change of the weight in some circumstances.; For example :; ```; H = sigmaz(); c_op_list = [1e-8*sigmap()]; L = liouvillian(H, c_op_list); n = H.shape[0]; b = np.zeros(n ** 2); print(L.data.todense()).

The elements of the Liouvillian have modulus close to unity, which should be reflected in the value of the weight. ```; # Current version; weight = np.mean(np.abs(L.data.data.max())); print('Weight',weight); b[0] = weight; Ldense = L.data.todense(); Ldense[0, :] = +np.diag(weight*np.ones(n)).reshape((1, n ** 2)); rho1 = np.linalg.solve(Ldense, b).

The proposed modification computes the modulus before evaluating the maximum for each line and then takes the mean. This may change the final steady state in some circumstances, but I could not rapidly find a situation where this is actually important. In this example, the two steady states are the same even though the weights are very different.; ```; np.linalg.norm(rho1-rho2); >> 1.1102230246251565e-16; ```. 2 ) Construction of the matrix to obtain the steady state; As mentioned by @fminga, this should not change anything in most situations.

Testability,"Thank you for such a quick response. I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner. > First of all, are you sure that either of DrudeLorentzBath and DrudeLorentzPadeBath give the right solution? Because the ck_real / vk_real are supposed to be the coefficients / exponents of the real part of the correlation function (and the others the imaginary part), and if you plug in imaginary parameters, then terms that previously were only in the real parts could pick up imaginary parts etc. Perhaps this kind of thing cancels out when you add the two unphysical D-L baths to get the shifted D-L bath?. One can use the analytic expression for monomer absorption spectra to test which Drude-Lorentz bath is correct. Also, one can use [DM-HEOM](https://github.com/noma/dm-heom) [2], where they have implemented the ""Shifted Drude Lorentz Bath"" [1]. Compared with their Matsubara implementation, it gives the same density matrix evolution (up to the numerical accuracy) as QuTiP's HEOM gives with `DrudeLorentzBath` and $\gamma \rightarrow \gamma \pm \Omega$ and $\lambda \rightarrow \lambda/2$. But it is not the case for `DrudeLorentzPadeBath`. You are right to think that the unphysical part goes away when two baths are added [1], one with $+i\Omega$ and the other with $-i\Omega$. > However, I would want to be very sure that in the case where the parameters are all real, the results are not affected by the change. Is that so? Only asking because that is not clear to me at first glance. You are very much in the right to be absolutely sure before making a change. As far as I understand and have tested, it will not change the real case because the changes are as follows (I have removed all the other lines in between for clarity):. ```python; - ck_real = [np.real(eta) for eta in eta_p]; + ck_real = [eta for eta in eta_p]. - ck_imag = [np.imag(eta_p[0])]; + ck_imag = [-lam*gamma]. - eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0) - 1.0j)]; + eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274:666,test,test,666,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,Thanks Chris. This is looking good. I'll try it out in more detail in the comings days. Some immediate comments:; - I don't think we should keep two code-paths for parsing the config file. So either we keep using the old manual parsing or we make configobj the official and only way to parse the config file. In that case I think it would be Ok to simply fail to parse the config file if configobj is not available. I don't think many users use the config file so would be to worried about breaking backwards compatibility with respect to this.; - I think I'd prefer to have the logging module called logging.py rather than _logging.py even though it is supposed to internal to qutip. ; - Please add a `__all__` list in logging.py; - Shouldn't configspec.ini be added to the setup.py file?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881:579,log,logging,579,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881,3,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"Thanks both @jakelishman and @hodgestar for your comments! I agree that I may be depending too much on the classes in `qutip.tests.core.data` to do the testing both in qutip-tensorflow and qutip-tensornetwork. I myself was worried of ""who is going to tests the tests"" if this trend continued with other packages. Reusing the `qutip.tests.core.data`'s code though helps to speed things up in the development process and also allows QuTiP to strictly define what each specialisation is meant to do. . As you mentioned above, I think it would be best to create a `qutip.core.data.testing` module where all the classes for testing are implemented. Then these classes could be tested to ensure that the proper tests are created and these classes ca be used by both QuTiP and downstream packages. I do not have time for this now but I will come to this later, so lets keep this PR open to discuss any ideas!. ----. > the data layer tests should really discover the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR). I am not sure about this one. Automatic discovery of tests for specialisations seems to lead to very restricted flexibility in how tests are parametrized. For instance, I needed to change the `rtol` to accommodate the tests for the complex64 data layer in qutip-tensorflow and I am not sure how this could be added automatically. . Also, as @hodgestar mentioned today, you probably want to be explicit on adding tests so that you are confident that those tests are running. Otherwise you need to constantly check the log to ensure the proper tests are running. . Another thing is that by being explicit on what is tested, you could assert if the tested specialisation has not been registered (which actually happened to both qutip-cupy and qutip-tensorflow before: specialisations where being tested but, surprisingly, they were not registered).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356:125,test,tests,125,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356,21,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'log', 'tested', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"Thanks for looking deeply into it. It's good to know the cause. We shouldn't remove support for SciPy 1.4 unless we _absolutely_ have to. Most users won't use matrices that large so won't be affected, and SciPy 1.5 is only a year old which is too recent to be a requirement in an academic setting. We should maintain at least a 2-year dependency window (like NumPy). Any constraints we make on allowable versions affect any packages downstream of us as well, so we want to try and stay as permissive as possible, as long as there's not new features that we absolutely must have. We already have mechanisms for working around an unstable `eigh` implementation because of problems with mac OpenBLAS `zheevr` in some cases, so we can add in this additional test when setting `eigh_unsafe` in our initialisation. The principle is that we decay to using the general-purpose `eig`, and include a specific orthonormalisation step to stabilise the eigensystem afterwards. This code is already in `qutip/sparse.py`, so it shouldn't be too hard to add an extra condition in `qutip/__init__.py`. Could you also test if the issue is also confined to MKL, or if it persists in OpenBLAS with SciPy 1.4 as well? We lose precision when swapping down to `eig` in place of `eigh`, so it's good to confine the switch to the minimum known-bad set.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109:754,test,test,754,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Thanks for the quick response @bencbartlett. . Feel free to ignore the comments regarding the shortening of arguments. That was just a suggestion to make things shorter. But as you said clarity is more important. I will not change `waveguide` to `wg` and I think you should leave the others as they are if you can't think of shorter ones. Same applies to the `temporal_basis_vector`. I think you can even add a `temporal_basis` as you mentioned. Regarding the double line breaks wrapping top-level functions, I know the pep8 standard is two newlines but some other QuTiP modules follow just a single line break, e.g., [floquet](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py). But again some other modules in QuTiP follow the pep8 standard and wrap two newlines for top-level functions. I am in favor of the pep8 standard and have two newlines. @ajgpitch what do you suggest?. Please remove the helper function `count_filled` without the test if it is not required. We aim to test as much as possible and remove redundancy in code. About `__all__`, I will shift all the rest in a new PR and we can keep yours as it is now.

I am also working on a new non-Markovian method which requires a class. Something of that sort is already used in `qutip.nonmarkov.heom`. I understand that many of qutip's solvers are written to be isolated functions but that should not mean that we should not write code to fully use the object oriented framework Python provides. Moreover, I noticed that you have to rewrite wrappers for the functions anyways to deal with repeatedly calculating things such as `scattering_probability` which clearly can be made much more compact if we use a class based approach.

Testability,"Thanks very much @Ericgig for preparing this!. I feel like it will be quite confusing if gates like `cnot` have different signatures than the ones in qutip-qip. Moreover, many of those gates/transformations are not only relevant to `qip`, but also used in other applications, so maybe we should keep more of them in the main qutip. One of the reasons that we want to include those gates into `qutip.operators` is because a few other downstream packages (e.g. `krylovsolver` that is now merged into qutip, and `qutip-tensornetwork` also uses Hadamard transform) also use them for testing (only) purposes. Having them in the main qutip may save them from depending on qutip-qip. I guess it would be better if we either; - Remove all qip and only define a few `_cnot`, `_swap` as private functions for testing inside the main qutip. And ask whoever else wants to use some gates to install `qutip-qip`. This may result in e.g. `qutip-tensornetwork` depending on `qutip-qip or having to implement a copy of some gates. or; - Include some more commonly used gates like `rx`, `ry` (they are unitaries generated by the Paulis and directly relevant to quantum control) `iswap` etc and keep them identical to the ones in qutip-qip, so that those who just want some gates for testing does not have to download the full qutip-qip. If the problem is the `qutip.qip.expand_operator`. I would argue that we can even include it into the main qutip. It is `tensor` + `permutation` and works not just for qubit systems, but also for other composite Hilbert spaces (provided a `dims`). It is quite handy not just for `qip`, but also for control and probably some other applications.

Testability,"Thanks victor!  My main worry as it stands is that, as I mentioned in the previous issue, this fix, on its own, introduces an unwanted additional error for the case with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, as then that time dependence essentially gets shifted twice, once by the H_shifted change, and once again by adding tlist[idx] to tau_list. ; This case of a time-dependent H could do with a test as well I guess. . This can be easily remedied by completely omitting the old method of shifting the time-dependence (e.g., using H and c_ops instead of H_shifted and c_ops_shifted in the call to mesolve(), for example).    But I am a little concerned that the the old method of shifting the time-dependence in H_shifted and C_ops_shifted was there for a reason.  @Ericgig any thoughts?. As an aside, I guess _correlation_mc_2t()  also needs a fix, but maybe better to do that in a separate issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1929#issuecomment-1153462129:390,test,test,390,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1929#issuecomment-1153462129,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Thanks, Kevin. And sorry for being slow to review this. I'll certainly merge it soon. One small thing, could you change naming (most importantly in the exception you raise at some point, and also in naming of the unit tests, etc) from old-style to function-callback style, which is how we usually refer to this td-format. I don't like the ""old-style format"" because it suggests that it is deprecated or inferior or has been replaced. Both function-callback and the list-string format for cython are fully supported methods and have their own distinct use-cases. While the cython format is faster, it is rather limited in what it can do, and sometimes the flexibility of the function-callback format is called form. Also, I wonder if you're method could not also be applied to `_correlation_me_2op_2t` ?

Testability,"The current `Qobj.type` attribute will be stored within the dimension object; unlike the list format, each object is unambiguously one single type (1D spaces are a problem in list form). Similarly, the ""size"" of a given dimension object is stored within it. ### How this solves the problems. Type inference is removed as a problem; each `Qobj` type has only one unambiguous representation when expressed as dimension objects. The actual name of the type could be stored as a string attached to the objects to maintain compatibility with the 4.x branch. Dimension compatibility test speed are solved by having dimensions represented by singleton class instances like the Python builtin `None`. The reason to use a singleton class is to replace `==` tests with `is` tests; the former is structural equality and requires walking the tensor structure, whereas the latter is referential equality, and is true if and only if the two operands are the same object in memory. For example the dimensions test of the `add` operation is now `left.dims is right.dims`, which is the same speed as comparing two integers. Dimension/shape compatibility is solved by attaching size information into the singleton classes. As the dimension objects are singletons, the size of a dimension object is calculated only on creation of the object. All subsequent `Qobj` that are of the same dimensions as one that came earlier will consequently reuse the same dimensions object, which already calculated its size. This avoids (relatively) expensive calls to `np.prod` on Python lists. The current list syntax allows for invalid dimensions to be represented such as `[2, 1]` (should be `[[2], [1]]`, probably). These sorts of failures cannot be represented in the new system. Similarly, `[[2], [1], [1]]` cannot be represented as the `Map` constructor will take only two arguments. ### Problems this does not immediately solve.

Testability,"The eigenvalues can be found with the typical functions present in qutip, such as `eigenenergies()` and `qutip.eigenstates()`. However, there can be some spurious eigenvalues, as detailed in this issue, #993. Only the steadystate, with eigenvalue 0, is assured to be correct. If you are just interested in the Liouvillian gap only, that should be fine. . Another faster and more stable technique that can be used in the case that only local dissipation processes are present (while the Hamiltonian is long range), is that of calculating the ""antigap"": since an additional weak PT symmetry is present, the symmetry of the Liouvillian spectrum in the complex plane can be exploited by just calculating the two largest eigenvalues. More details about this method, also benchmarking the validity of the Liouvillian gap calculated from a PIQS object, can be found here https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07570. .

As an example, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/amcdawes/437f8756fcb8ff8ca4c1b720600adf43) demonstrates a fix whereby all eigenstates are made to have positive initial values.

Testability,"The internal data type for storing dynamics generators (Hamiltonians), propagators, and the time evolution can now be set as Qobj. When using Qobj the propagators are computed using qutip methods for expm. Resolves #370; The default for small systems remains ndarray, as this provides much faster execution (factor of 10 approx). However, it is assumed, but not yet tested, that for larger systems the Qobj propagation will be faster, and certainly less memory consumptive. The internal data type (if not specified) is chosen automatically using the same criteria Qobj.expm() uses to determine whether to use the (cython) sparse method.; The main motivation for implementing this change is for users developing their own custom fidelity and gradient measures which use the partial trace method. Consequently, preserving the dimensions is important. This has been shown (by colleagues testing) to be more efficient than recreating the Qobjs from ndarrays.; The internal operator processing methods and attributes have been renamed with underscores preceding to indicate that these will be of the internal operator data type. Accessors have been added that will always provide Qobj representations of the operators.; Theoretically any operator data type that supports the dot() method could be used, e.g. some other sparse matrix type, however this has not been extensively tested and should be considered an experimental feature.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/397:366,test,tested,366,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/397,3,['test'],"['tested', 'testing']"

Also, sometimes the processing is terminated early (by the scheduler on the cluster we use), and so having some filesystem output can mean that some kind of result can be extracted.

Testability,"The problem appears in qutip version 4.0.0 when considering the tensor product of a few systems, and including more than one dissipation channel. I noticed a similar issue on a much more complex system, but in the code attached I consider the simplest system on which I have found the bug to appear. Consider three uncoupled qubits, each with a distinct frequency. The Hamiltonian is (ignoring tensor products with identity matrices) :. H = (w1 / 2) * sigmaz_1 + (w2 / 2) * sigmaz_2 + (w3 / 2) * sigmaz_3. Let us couple qubits 2 and 3 to independent white-noise environments through operators sigmax_2 and sigmax_3. Qubit 1 is decoupled from the other qubits, and does not couple to any relaxation channel. We consider the initial state |1:e, 2:g, 3:g>, where g(e) labels the ground (excited) state of a qubit, and evaluate the population of the excited state of qubit 1 as a function of time using bloch_redfield_tensor() and bloch_redfield_solve(). Since qubit 1 is decoupled from the other qubits, its excited-state population should remain 1 at all times. Yet, qutip yields exponential decay of the population of qubit 1. I noticed that when I remove dissipation for qubit 2 (keeping only dissipation through sigmax_3), the problem disappears and qubit 1 forever stays in its excited state. So the problem seems to arise when combining two relaxation sources. I am using qutip version 4.0.0. A colleague of mine tried the attached test code on qutip version 3.1.0 and did not catch any bug (i.e. qubit 1 did not relax with qutip 3.1.0). So the problem seems to be related to versions of qutip later than 3.1.0. Can anyone replicate the bug with the attached code ? .

Testability,"There were a few invalid escape sequences and scipy imports that somehow escaped being fixed #1493, so this fixes those. Also, in #1480 we issued deprecation warnings for user-facing uses of `eseries`, `essolve` and `ode2es`, however we are not deprecating the correlation and spectrum methods (in QuTiP 5.0 the necessary components are just absorbed into private functions inside `correlation.py`), so these should not generate warnings. Simon (@hodgestar) and I briefly discussed whether we needed a special warnings filter inside those functions, but we thought we didn't need it because default Python filters would prevent `DeprecationWarning` from being shown, since it is triggered by library code and not code in `__main__`. The problem is that not everything uses the default filters; both `pytest` and the documentation build do not suppress all `DeprecationWarning` messages. This was a particular problem in `pytest`, where approximately 68,000 warnings (!) were generated. Since this is _not_ deprecated functionality, nor is it using deprecated functionality, so there shouldn't be any warnings. This PR removes those as well. The end result is that a completely clean documentation build now should generate 0 warnings. My eventual intent is to create an automatic documentation build process, which treats warnings as errors to prevent us from breaking it in PRs. This cannot happen until the merger of the documentation into this repository, however, because otherwise new features/feature removals could get into an impossible situation where the two PRs to `qutip` and `qutip-doc` would not be aware of each other, so would return failed CI.

Testability,"There's a distinction between `git` and GitHub here, in that PRs are purely a GitHub thing. As far as `git` is concerned, there's actually no problem at all with a PR being merged from `master` on somebody else's fork (`master` after all is an arbitrary label). The reason to do it is that the person who created the PR will find it harder to incorporate upstream changes, because their `master` will now always be out-of-sync from ours until they fetch from our `master` and do a `git reset --hard` onto it, which would delete their commits and force their branch to line up with ours again. From our side, it makes no difference except that the default commit message that Github gives us will say `Merge branch mlaguna10:master into qutip:master`.

Testability,"This PR fixes every warning reported in `pytest`, and then makes `pytest` treat warnings as errors to hopefully make sure we stick to this state of affairs. (Or at least it fixes all the ones that appear on my particular machine...). The reason this is desirable is that it means we cannot ignore deprecation warnings in dependencies or even in our own code. It also helps us not let certain parts of the codebase get lost in the sands of time, or at least compels us to do something about potential problems before they actually become catastrophic. This is _somewhat_ of a trial, though I hope we can stick to it; warnings usually indicate that something's wrong. Tests can still test run code that generates warnings, but you now have to mark it explicitly in `pytest`. This doesn't mean you should just ""blank out"" warnings by filtering them away. You should first consider if what you're doing is the right way to do it (fix the warning), and then only if it absolutely is and you're testing something that is _supposed_ to warn, then you can use `pytest.warns` to _assert_ that it warns. Of note: a `warnings.catch_warnings` block _inside_ a test (i.e. in test code, not module code) does not work when `pytest` is treating warnings as errors. There are a few classes of fixes in this PR:. - filtering ""expected"" warnings from `pyximport` (hoping to remove QuTiP's dependence on this in 5.0 anyway); - removal of the old `np.matrix` type in favour of `ndarray`, with some changes to accommodate the different arithmetic semantics; - convert an `__init__` method in a test into just class attributes to allow `pytest` to collect it; - bug fixes for behaviour that was raising warnings we hadn't been paying attention to.

It ""simply"" writes the entire history of the `qutip/qutip-doc` repository into `qutip/qutip` as if it has always been there within the subdirectory `doc`. The commit objects of `qutip/qutip-doc` are all _technically_ completely rewritten (all the hashes change when you change the tree structure), but I kept all the metadata of them so they'll appear the same, and you can traverse the history just like you could before. Aside from the complete rewriting of history to place it inside a `doc` subdirectory, `git` sees this PR as an actual merge commit, because I melded the two repositories together. All commits will appear separately in `git log`, as you'd expect (although by default `git log --graph` might only show you one branch). I rewrote history to make using `git log` and `git blame` a little less confusing; if I had just made a single commit renaming everything into the subdirectory, there might have been weird name conflicts and a rename to navigate when trying to look through the history. This PR also logically changes a few links, so there are 3 commits tacked on the top to make the necessary changes within the `doc` folder and within the main QuTiP README. These include moving the docs GitHub Actions workflow up into the root of the repository (and suitably modifying it), and updating several links within the documentation. The documentation build action [has succeeded on my branch](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip/runs/2469049269). I have excluded the `docs` repository from the CodeClimate analysis, since it's not really part of the code we want tested. I'm not absolutely certain that this is the correct decision (there's plenty of ancient code within `docs`), so I'm open to changing it.

Having them in QuTiP should help a lot. I've run some informal checks against other libraries, and the results returned by the new dnorm method agree pretty well; I'll write more formal tests soon. Adding tensor swap and dual channel functionality is helpful in writing specialized cases for dnorm based on the observation that the diamond norm for positive maps is the same as the completely-bounded infinity norm (see [Johnston and Kribs](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0948v2.pdf) and Watrous' notes). I hope to have this case added to dnorm soon as well, but I wanted to focus on making sure that the prerequisite features are included and well-tested.

Testability,"This branch adds support for `rho0` argument to `mesolve` being a superoperator, to resolve #384. The functionality has been added to all the different mesolvers (but not the sesolvers). Unit tests are added to tests/test_mesolve.py in a new class, `TestMESolveSuperInit`. There are tests for all the different mesolvers, and the result with `rho0` as a density matrix is compared to the result for `rho0` being the identity super-operator, by comparing the fidelity of the resulting states in each respective case. The reason the tests are a little bit slow compared to, e.g., the tests in `TestMESolveTDDecay` is the computation of the fidelity of the states at all the different times. If you think the tests are too slow, i can change them, and for example only check the fidelity of the final state. As a side note: As I wrote this new functionality, I also ran some simple tests comparing a pure python implementation of the right hand side for `_mesolve_const` to the cython implementation (I did this because I was considering how much cython code I had to write, or if a pure python implementation of the new functionality would suffice). I actually found that a pure python implementation was as fast (or maybe slightly _faster_) than the cython implementation. The pure python implementation of the right hand side is simply (see lines 767-769 of mesolve.py). ``` python; def _ode_rho_test(t, rho, data):; # for performance comparison of cython code; return data*(np.transpose(rho)); ```.

Testability,"This document is a design specification for new dimensions handling. It is only a draft right now; please feel free to offer comments and suggestions. If you only read one section, read ""Overview"" inside ""Proposal"" to get the gist of what will happen. ## Background. For an extended discussion of some of the problems in 4.x branch dimension handling, see #1320. With the new system, we aim to solve a few main problems:; 1. `Qobj` `type` inference should be instantaneous; 2. Binary operation dimension compatibility tests should be instantaneous; 3. Dimension/shape equality tests should be instantaneous; 4. Invalid dimensions should not be representable; Currently, dimension handling is the major overhead in `Qobj` because these problems are not solved. The allowed exception to point 1 is if we include a short-hand notation to represent dimension objects; we may allow a ""pure-Python"" representation (effectively the current dimension specification) to be parsed into new-form dimension objects for user convenience. Certain objects, like the excitation-number-restricted spaces (enr) may not have ""compatible"" dimensions and shapes. This may need further discussion elsewhere. ## Proposal. ### Overview. The principle change is to make dimension objects singleton instances of classes. All `Qobj` of the same dimension will have a reference to the exact same object, which has all the expensive operations already calculated. Internally, dimensions will represented in a very pure linear algebra manner. A dimension object is a single `Dims` object, which is exactly one of the subclasses:; - `Space` representing a vector space; * `Space(size: int)` is a standard ket; * `Space(Map(...))` is an operator-ket; - `Space(Map(from, to))` representing an operator in column-stacked format.; - `Map(from, to)` representing some mapping `Dims -> Dims`; - `Field` used only to represent the absence of `Dims` in `Map` and `Compound`.

At the time we fixed those tests (#1298, #1301), but this intermittent failure of `test_diag_liou_mult` may have slipped through. Equally, at the same time on `dev.major` I think I was moving the `brtools` internals to use the new `CSR` types, which involved rewriting things like `diag_liou_mult`. I don't think this is the cause (though I may have done at the time), because we see the intermittent test failures still on `master`, which does not use the new types yet.

Testability,"This is a tidied up and completed version of #934. The first commit is credited to the original author (although I fixed up some little concerns in the PR and rebased it), because it's logically built off that PR, although in the end it's a complete reimplementation. This is a complete rewrite of the Husimi Q calculations, to make a more formal split between the iterative (low-memory) and precomputed (faster) algorithms, giving full access to both of them. It's a bit easier to use from a user's perspective, and it's faster than #934 as well. The concept of the precomputed matrix is encapsulated into a class with a cached tensor, so that the same precomputed system can be used for many states of different sizes, and autoexpands (up to the memory limit) to accommodate larger states. This is called `QFunc` as opposed to the standard function interface `qfunc`. It also adds rather more error checking on its inputs, and adds a complete testing suite for the new implementation. Closes #934. ## Examples. Let's say we have some states, and the phase-space coordinates we want to calculate the Husimi Q function at.; ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> states = [qutip.rand_dm(32, density=0.2) for _ in [None]*100]; >>> xs = np.linspace(-2, 2, 401); ```. Now the normal way of calculating the Q distribution for a single state is; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs); array( ... ); ```. This already has some speed advantages over the pre-PR version of `qfunc`, because it caches a lot of its intermediary results, to avoid recomputing them. This results in calculating more matrix-vector products than before, but far fewr FLOPS overall. By default, `qfunc` issues a warning if it exceeds a certain amount of memory, and falls back to the low-memory version. You can control this limit with the `precompute_memory` option:; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs, precompute_memory=0); qutip/qutip/wigner.py:822: UserWarning: Falling back to iterative algorithm due to lack of mem",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583:185,log,logically,185,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583,2,"['log', 'test']","['logically', 'testing']"
Testability,"This is causing test failures in all CI builds against scipy 1.5 currently. The other failing tests on scipy 1.5 are due to changes to the handling of `csr` matmul operations, which is fixed in patch #1298. As far as I can see, there is no way to recover the exact same behaviour as existed in scipy < 1.5 (there's optimisations of the `lwork` input to the LAPACK routine), and consequently we are not getting the exact same set of eigenvectors for problem dimensions > 32. This does not mean that `brtools` is suddenly doing something wrong. It just means that the test assumed we would have the exact same output as `scipy`, and we don't any more. . This is an annoying problem to fix, I think. Two possible methods:. 1. attempt to ""trick"" scipy into doing the same pre-1.5 behaviour. Possibly this would involve monkey-patching out the ability of `eigh` to optimise the `lwork` parameters (i.e. stubbing out `scipy.linalg.lapack._compute_lwork` to always return `lwork=18*nrows`, `lrwork=24*nrows` and `liwork=10*nrows` to match `qutip.cy.brtools.ZHEEVR`).; 2. do some linear algebra work to determine that the eigenvectors we have returned are equivalent to the ones scipy has returned. 2 is a better solution, but harder to implement, especially in the presence of degenerate or near-degenerate eigenvalues (of which there are likely a lot around 0). 1 is very unsatisfying, but might be enough. In general, this problem will hopefully be solved a bit more thoroughly when `brmesolve` is updated to use the new data layer types, and we standardise the calculation of eigenvalues and -vectors across QuTiP. Hopefully someone has a better idea than me? @Ericgig, @nonhermitian.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1299:16,test,test,16,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1299,4,"['stub', 'test']","['stubbing', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"This issue has a two-fold interest: decreasing test time in general and expand the platforms through which QuTiP is available. . What is the reason it takes so long on Nix?

Much of this I think is due to the Cython configurations, indeed the no-cython option takes only 13 minutes. My first suggestion would be to try without Cython if things speed up, from those requirements (@Ericgig set that up and I am not knowledgeable about it). . From your PR on `nixpkgs` do you build on Travis CI or a similar cloud? If you could give a list of time taken by the different tests that would help. .

Testability,"This moves our entire testing apparatus over to GitHub Actions, since Travis has changed its pricing model and we can no longer rely on it. This actually has several advantages for us right now:; - better integration with other GitHub Actions workflows; - more concurrent jobs; - more access to Windows and macOS machines; - easier job dependency graphs within our resources. This first commit does not add in any Windows tests because they're currently known to fail, but the intention is to turn them on. The blocking issue is currently a failure of the multiprocessing capabilities, which also affects mcsolve. We can now reasonably run coverage reporting on every test run, and upload all of them to Coveralls at the end, so we get accurate stats on what lines were actually tested. I've also turned pytest's timer, so it reports all tests that took longer than a second to run. This should really help identify where the real problems in our testing are - right now you should see that there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now.

Testability,"This relaxes the amount of sorting required in the `add_csr` operation. In the current version in `dev.major`, both the left and right matrices are sorted in all cases. This PR makes `add_csr` an `Accumulator` operation, which straight away reduces the number of sorts required to one. Second, I add a track inside `scatter` to know whether the scatters were in sorted order; if so, there's no need to sort within `gather`, which removes the other sort from `add_csr`. Effectively, this means that `add_csr` is O(n) when both input matrices are sorted (the most common) and O(n lg(n)) when either isn't, and we don't actually have to perform a separate test to decide between them. In practice, this is around a 2x speedup for most common sparse matrices, and goes up from there. I have also made `Accumulator` a C struct, and all the operations on it header-file only. This allows them to be operated on without holding the GIL (though threaded access to the same one would be unsafe anyway), and it also allows them to be inlined - if they are defined in the `pyx` file, then they will be compiled into a separate object and so must be called. We had talked about making `CSR` have a ""guarantee"" that it is always sorted, but I haven't implemented that here. Because of the changes to `scatter`, that would no longer give an algorithmic speedup in this case for matrices that are sorted (although we could avoid the use of `Accumulator` which would be more efficient). All of the operations I have written return a sorted matrix, so generally matrices will tend to become sorted over time anyway.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1362:653,test,test,653,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1362,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"This test would fail approximately 1 in 10 times. I have parametrised the test case so pytest sees the different dimension runs as separate elements, which gives us better information on what's going on. I have only seen the test fail on CI on Mac, as best as I remember, and after a bit of experimentation, I was able to reproduce the issue on my Mac at approximately the same frequency as we saw it on Travis, if I was using OpenBLAS. I couldn't reproduce the failures with MKL, so I'm fairly sure this is to do with our use of `eig` instead of `eigh` on Mac/OpenBLAS to avoid segfaults (see #1197, #1288). This makes some sense - the tolerances of `eig` are effectively slightly more permissive than `eigh` when dealing with real numbers, because there's more scope for an eigenvalue to be different by having a small imaginary component (contributes in quadrature) as opposed to only having the linear difference. I'm pretty confident that there's no logic error that caused the tolerances to slip a little, it's just a reality of dealing with an imperfect eigensystem solver, so I've relaxed the test tolerances by just a little.

Testability,"This took longer than anticipated because of a bunch of knock-on nasty Cython problems, and I struggled to get OpenMP running locally on macOS ([but I've got it now](https://www.binhbar.com/posts/2020/06/compiling-openmp-libraries-on-macos/)). Tag: @Ericgig, @ajgpitch. ---. Separate out what will become the ""core"" of qutip into its own subpackage. This package is intended to have most of its public symbols re-imported into the global package namespace. There should be no substantive changes to any actual worker code in this large commit, just what is necessary to carve out a major entangled part of the core library. Some files currently in core may be moved out in a future version (e.g. graph, metrics, semidefinite), but right now they are too entangled with `Qobj` or other true-core parts, and to remove them now would require too much substantive change to the code, which would be difficult to review in this commit. Major changes required as part of this:; - module-level imports (e.g. `from qutip.qobj import Qobj`) are replaced with simple ones from the namespace (e.g. `from qutip import Qobj`). While inside the `core` package, imports are kept as module-specific, largely to support the mess of circular imports present in qutip at the more.; - .pxi files are no longer recommended as the way to share code between Cython files, so these have been converted into proper Cython modules and added to the distribution.; - collection of Cython extension components in `setup.py` is consolidated to support them no longer all existing in the same place. As the data layer is fleshed out, likely there will be even more Cython locations present.; - the test for OpenMP in `__init__.py` had to be made more indirect via importlib to avoid causing a full import of `qutip.core`, which would in turn cause Qobj and other parts to be imported.

Testability,"Two small bugs appeared in floquet steadystate in v5, this is a quick patch. **Description**; Two bugs:. 1) Small minus sign error in one of the terms (comparing to v4.7 and what is written in the old toolbox guide). 2) Some kind of data copying confusion with the S and T operators when updating their data contents with the results. Just initiating these two separately seems to fix it. other minor fix: updated the link to the toolbox guide. Some other minor niggles that I didn't fix:; - some of the optional solver methods dont work (seem not to support square right hand sides in '_data.solve()'. I didn't dig much on fixing these though. - the 'splu' method fails for a couple of reasons. I can get it to work by removing the choice of warnings as errors in 'solve.py' (which make it fail in other instances as well i suppose, like with normal steadystate()), making sure the solver option is not passed to steadystate(), and making sure that S and T are always converted back to CSR() after being updated in the iterative bit (in `steadystate_floquet()' they get returned as dense from _data.solve). I did not include those changes here though as the docstrings dont actually indicate support for splu anyway, so perhaps not needed. I am marking this as draft at the moment as I also want to update the test to be sensitive to these bugs (its a bit too coarse at the moment), and double check that the results from this solver are now correct. **Related issues or PRs**; fix #2386",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393:1311,test,test,1311,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Update Travis build passes. ### Summary . This PR helps convert between superop reps with non-square shape. This is needed because quantum channels can have input and output spaces of different dimension. It works between super, choi, kraus. It correctly handles tensor product structures and systems with different dimensions e.g. a qubit and a qutrit. . It does not work for Chi rep or the Steinspring rep. In the Chi rep only the qubit Pauli basis has been implemented. One would need to first get the Chi rep working for Qudits. At the moment it is unclear how to generalize to the Stinespring rep. . **changes**; - in `type_from_dims` the flag `enforce_square` was set to `False`. This helps in the conversion.; - in `qobj`, `__mul__` was extended to allow construction of non square operators from an outer product using the suggestion of @Ericgig ; - `_super_tofrom_choi`, `choi_to_kraus`, `kraus_to_choi` have been changed so they work with non-square shapes.; - to support the above changes `vector_to_operator` and `vec2mat` were changed to allow for non square shapes. **other changes**; - `Qobj permute`. `tidyup` was removed from to resolve a failing test at the suggestion of @nonhermitian ; - `choi_to_kraus` and `to_kraus`. When converting from Choi to to Kraus there are many small norm Kraus operators. A `tol` parameter was added to help remove these spurious operators. ### Added Tests; **test_superoperator_reps**; - Convert non-square Kraus operator to Super + Choi matrix and back.; - Neglect tiny Kraus operators when converting Choi to Kraus. **test_superoper**; - Operator - vector - operator conversion with a tensor product state.; - Operator - vector - operator conversion for non-square matrix. **test_qobj**; - bra and ket multiplication with different dims e.g. [N, 1] and [1, M] for M \neq N",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1098#issuecomment-576981021:1164,test,test,1164,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1098#issuecomment-576981021,2,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'test']"

Testability,"Using integer-like floats in `math.factorial` is deprecated as of Python 3.9. Glancing over the rest of the code, I'm fairly sure `math.factorial` is only called on floats formed by (e.g.) `N / 2 + 0.5`, which is guaranteed be an integer for all odd `N` integers, but to be safe I inserted the same test that `math.factorial` will do as well. By the way: depending on how accurate you actually want/need to be with your degeneracy calculations, a common way to deal with these binomial quantities is to work in the logarithmic space --; ```python; def factln(x):; return scipy.special.gammaln(x + 1). def energy_degeneracy(N, m):; return int(np.exp(Decimal(factln(N) - factln(N/2 + m) - factln(N/2 - m)))); ```; This is pretty much guaranteed to be faster, but a little less precise; double-precision floats have ~15 decimal digits of precision compared to the `Decimal` default of 28. You have to be careful that the `np.exp` call doesn't overflow (unless you can use the number in logarithmic space as well), but you can just use a single `Decimal` instance like I did if it really matters to you to have huuuuge numbers output. I suspect it doesn't, since you multiply it by a float right after, which will overflow to `inf`. Timings:; ```python; from math import factorial; from decimal import Decimal; import numpy as np; from scipy.special import gammaln. def degeneracy_all_decimal(N, m):; return int(Decimal(factorial(N)) / (Decimal(factorial(int(N/2+m))) * Decimal(factorial(int(N/2-m))))). def degeneracy_log_then_decimal(N, m):; return int(np.exp(Decimal(gammaln(N+1) - gammaln(N/2+m+1) - gammaln(N/2-m+1)))). def degeneracy_log(N, m):; return int(np.exp(gammaln(N+1) - gammaln(N/2+m+1) - gammaln(N/2-m+1))); ```; ```python; In [3]: %timeit degeneracy_all_decimal(1000, 0); ...: %timeit degeneracy_log_then_decimal(1000, 0); ...: %timeit degeneracy_log(1000, 0); 831 µs ± 1.91 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each); 31.9 µs ± 190 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs,",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1550:299,test,test,299,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1550,2,"['log', 'test']","['logarithmic', 'test']"

Testability,"Well, the default implementation for states is actually nearly completely unchanged (the only difference is that I replaced `np.fliplr(array)` with `array[::-1]`, which I think is a more readable idiom for ""backwards""). You're right that in the new form, basically the method is that you cache various parts of the `np.polyval` call into a 3D tensor, rather than recomputing this large polynomial each time. The `np.polyval` call is how you actually go from an array of different values of `alpha` (which comes from the meshgrid) to the coherent state, but doing it with `polyval` means you construct the coherent state and do the dot product simultaneously to save memory. If you need to repeat the calculations a bunch, and you've got enough memory to spare, you can build up all the `alpha**n / sqrt(factorial(n))` tensor once, then just dot it against every state. Since we're dealing with _complex_ Hilbert spaces, the inner product isn't a straight dot product, it needs the conjugate of one of the sides, so we only store the conjugate of the alpha tensor. You can see in the timings that this isn't _always_ the biggest win you'd expect; in some cases, the additional memory usage causes you to be more heavily bound by memory bandwidth issues rather than CPU pipelined stuff, which is another reason we allow forcing either method to be used. If you're interested in the most readable implementation, you might want to look at the test:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/a20c26307e2f6e738f87efd75abafc3dff4daad5/qutip/tests/test_wigner.py#L251-L260",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877254212:1440,test,test,1440,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877254212,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"When I tried to use the `qutip.squeeze` function for my simulations I noticed that something was off. Upon further investigation I found out that the output is not a truncated version of the single-mode squeezing unitary, but rather the matrix exponential of the truncated generator. These are _very_ different things!. Am I right in assuming that the most useful matrix would be the truncated unitary? If that's the case, the current method to compute it is wrong. To compute the right matrix one can use the disentangling formula for SU(1,1) (formula (31) [here](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.3413923)):. ```python; def squeeze(n,z):; s0 = np.exp(1j*np.angle(z))*np.tanh(abs(z)); s1 = -2*np.log(np.cosh(abs(z))); s2 = -np.exp(-1j*np.angle(z))*np.tanh(abs(z)); ; L = s0*0.5*(qt.create(n)*qt.create(n)); K = s1*(0.5*qt.num(n)+0.25*qt.identity(n)); R = s2*0.5*(qt.destroy(n)*qt.destroy(n)); ; return (L.expm())*(K.expm())*(R.expm()); ```. As you can see, this definition does *not* depend on the truncation parameter. Specifically, the upper-left portion of the matrix that `qutip.squeeze` outputs converges to my `squeeze` function for large `n`. I suspect that one can apply similar arguments to other functions in `qutip`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/661:706,log,log,706,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/661,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Why though? It _is_ a badly written function and it should be changed. It's a true error, and I wouldn't be confident that there isn't an edge-case bug in it, because it's got so many branches I can't separate them easily in my head when reading it. There's loads of ways to write the same functionality where it's decomposed into smaller bits that are all much easier to check for correctness individually (`mul_dense`, `mul_scalar`, `mul_sparse`, etc) - way easier to verify the top-level dispatching logic into those bits, and then way easier to verify each individual component within them. Also, as long as we have the ""TODO"" error filter turned on, it would be wrong to silence the error that comes from adding a new one, right? If we wanted to skip it, we should turn it off globally (which I'm not against for the TODO thing). If it's in, this way at least lets us use codeclimate properly to see when certain errors were introduced, or when issues in funny-looking functions might have been affected.

Testability,"Without seeing the code it is difficult to be sure exactly what this problem was. Python's garbage collection should have been aggressively pruning the stored objects once they were no longer referenced, and I'm not aware of any other people reporting memory usage problems in `mesolve`, but it's possible there was a reference being kept to a dense Liouvillian at every time step at some point in the past (the Liouvillian would explain the N^4 usage, as opposed to a dm which should be just N^2). I'm fairly sure this isn't a problem any more at least; I was able to run the test script; ```python; import qutip; import numpy as np; N = 500; L = [[qutip.liouvillian(qutip.rand_herm(N)), '1']]; rho = qutip.rand_dm(N); times = np.linspace(0, 1, 101); e_op = qutip.jmat((N - 1)/2, 'x'); qutip.mesolve(L, rho, times, e_ops=[e_op]); ```; on a fairly non-descript Macbook without issue as of a `master` shortly (hopefully) before the 4.6 release, without ever exceeding 3GB of RAM used.

Testability,"Yeah, `qutip-qip` is a much easier build and installation process because you don't need to be concerned about compiler infrastructure, ABI compatibility or stuff like that. In addition in that particular test run, there were three individual calls to change the installed packages, which meant plenty of space for stuff to go wrong. In this case, I think it was a strange interaction between the old `.travis.yml` specifically installing `numpy` and all other dependencies from `conda-forge`, without the channel being in the defaults list. Since `conda uninstall` doesn't specify an additional channel, the dependency calculator considers `defaults` to be higher priority, so it sets various packages to arbitrary allowed ones from `defaults`, which with `openblas` installed like this meant numpy `1.14`. That's my guess at least - it's a pretty weird set up circumstances, but the new `.travis.yml` file that's already in `master` is far simpler about the build process.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609:205,test,test,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Yeah, auto-tidyup should be a function of CSR matrices only. It doesn't make sense for dense matrices to have it, that's just burning cycles. As Asier mentioned, you already can't rely on floating-point operations being exactly identical between different matrix types, so there's no particular problem there. The point about auto-differentiation is an excellent reason that it must be allowed to vary between types as well. To be honest, I'm not sure how many cases the auto-tidyup operation actually helps in keeping things efficient. It may well be worth us having a proper investigation, and seeing how often it actually helps. I can tweak the addition and matrix-multiplication sparse algorithms to automatically tidy up when generating their output (if they don't already...), in which case we could probably entirely remove all ""automatic"" tidyup, and just have it be a manual operation?. `isherm_csr_full` is actually explicitly meant to handle all cases, _especially_ those involving matrices that have not been tidied up. The logic is actually sound (it's been deployed in `master` for a while now), but looks like there's a typo made when I handled the merge up, and the data-layer is missing a few of its mathematical tests so it didn't get spotted.

Testability,"Yeah, definitely there's no point running tests that aren't really testing the package properly. I would hope that if we're much more aggressive about converting time-dependent lists into QobjEvo objects inside `mesolve`, `mcsolve` and `sesolve` (or the class-based versions of them), we could significantly reduce the amount of testing that needs to be done with them. Most of the tests of time-dependent formats would then occur in the QobjEvo tests. We could still test all the configurations of the solvers without too heavy a time penalty. If we only use a small number of different time-dependent operators, we can compile them all only once, and have `pytest` manage the resources through shared fixtures. That would really cut down the run times, especially for the current ""slow"" tests. Another avenue for cutting down run time is if we could merge say the MKL and OpenMP tests into one Travis job - the setup time for one job is about 2.5 minutes, and that's before any tests have run at all. I would hazard a guess that having MKL but not OpenMP is a pretty rare case (maybe more common on high-performance clusters where people submit single-cpu jobs?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182:42,test,tests,42,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182,9,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"Yeah, on the practical side I was using those states to construct collapse operators, and then using these in steadystate() for a large range of parameters. Bit surprised to see what took 20 minutes in 4.7 took >5 hours in in v5 :0 I guess this is a combo of Liouvillian construction taking much longer as it then converts the Hamiltonian to Dense as well, and steady-state solving taking a bit longer too. Of course I can manually make those operators sparse (and then v5 just takes 7 mins!), but more generally, I think the logic of default_dtype is nice; essentially allows you to run QuTiP in that 'mode'. Also useful for cases like making jax objects, etc. ; I have another case where I actually want all operators to be dense, as I use .expm() a lot. . I think most functions in operators.py and states.py follow this logic, e.g., `basis()` in states.py: `dtype = dtype or settings.core[""default_dtype""] or _data.Dense`. I think it seems to make sense to apply it universally, irrespective of whether a particular object is naturally of one type or another, to avoid the cost of conversion when doing lots of repetitive things, avoid accidentally getting or making a particular type when you expect something different from default_dtype, etc. edit: Just to add, your suggestion of having two different default_dtypes could be nice too.

If so, try this patch: [check_convert.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4397692/check_convert.txt). It rearranged the functions a little for a more logical order (I'll rebase the PR before merge), but the main change is that it now tests the output of `convert -version` to see if it contains the substring `imagemagick` (case insensitive). The reason to do this now is because if we allowed the error to propagate later, we'd have to check it every time and it would mean we'd have to pass through the ""special cases"" more frequently, and it would make the core logic more complex. Also, we _could_ catch a subprocess `CalledProcessError` later (say if one of the other commands were to fail for some reason) and re-raise our own, but to be honest I didn't want to over-engineer what ought to have been a relatively simple PR.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1194#issuecomment-605504526:564,log,logical,564,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1194#issuecomment-605504526,3,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'logical', 'tests']"

They are not that trivial to implement like the rest of the gates and are also not limited to just `qip`. Keep them consistent with other functions that generate Qobj (support `dtype`).; - Remove all rest of the gates and create some private substitutions just for testing. We should probably add somewhere in the changelog for the major release that if users are using gates like `cnot` for testing and now cannot find it.

Testability,"Yes, there are some cases where the dense operation is much faster. But there will be others (larger H space) where the sparse routine is faster. And it's not really fair to compare when you don't include the preops in the timeit. It's difficult, but not impossible, for us to tell in the code which situation we are in when make a superop vector multiplication. If we add lots of checks in, then this will slow things too. I think this is similar to #818. If we are going to address this, that is use dense matrix algebra for small systems, then we need to do it comprehensively. As is outlined in #437. I don't think we should make small changes in individual functions, this could make a big mess. I am putting a proposal together for a funding application. I have included work to something like #437. Maybe I will have time before also. You could maybe do something in your HEOM work where you have a `dense_oper` attribute, in which case you use numpy dense operations. I do this in the control modules, where typically the Hamiltonians are small. You can quickly run out of memory though, as the `L` gets very big, esp for `k >> 1`.

Testability,"You can see from the attached figure that it works pretty good, even at lower Hilbert space sizes. I would be hesitant to add both options because the bicgstab method fails not because of too few iterations, but because of some ""breakdown"" that can not be figured out. Since the current method works so well, and the only issues are the number of iterations, which is taken care of by using a preconditioner, it seems that the LMGRES method is the way to go. .

Does it make any sense to add an option to select bicgstab or lmgres, or does lmgres beat bicgstab in all cases you have looked at?

Testability,"_**edit to put the positivity up top!**_: This is a very exciting prospect to me, and I'm always happy when other libraries want to interact with QuTiP! In the interests of inciting more discussion, I've got thrown in some more discussion points below - I'm 100% sure they're all solvable, but it also seems like there isn't one way that's unambiguously correct to do them, so they're worth discussing. ---. In principle I'm happy to implement this, though I don't really agree with your assertion that `othertype.toqobj()` is bad style! It might be so in Julia, but Python doesn't have all the same multiple-dispatch niceties that Julia has, so at the end of the day, we have to add in a method with a ""magic"" name somewhere, and it all just comes down to choosing the name of the method. The downside to having a magic name is that it means we have to eschew proper namespacing; what if another library one day wants to call their interface the same thing? Then it's completely impossible for a downstream library to interoperate with both. Having conversions be a non-special method of the downstream class, and leaving our constructor unaware of them alleviates that issue. Numpy can get away with squatting the `__array__` name because they're _huge_, but I would argue that if we do it, we could actually _harm_ the quantum software ecosystem in the long-run - what happens when a package better than QuTiP comes along that wants to call its objects `Qobj` as well? Let's face it - it's a pretty straightforward name!. All that said, I am very aware that not everyone agrees with me on this, and I _am_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no ot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:488,assert,assertion,488,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['assert'],['assertion']

Testability,"_Last updated: 2020-08-12_. This is an issue for tracking and publicising the development status of a separated data layer. This is a major breaking change to be introduced in QuTiP 5, and will change how library functions and users access the underlying data structures of `Qobj`. This document and issue will change over time. Development is taking place on the [`dev.major` branch](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/tree/dev.major) in `qutip/qutip`. Pull requests implementing new features:; - #1282 separating out the core QuTiP operations into a (logical but user-transparent) package `qutip.core`.; - #1296 implementing the first parts of the data multiple dispatch and new data types.; - #1332 replacing the `fast_csr_matrix` with the new Cython type `CSR` all across QuTiP; - #1338 implementing the data-layer creation, conversion and dispatcher routines. We are writing a new ""developers' guide"" to explain the logic behind the design decisions, and help new QuTiP developers work on the code. You can follow initial development hosted as [a repo in my user account](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-devguide) until we decide how this will be added to the main documentation. You can view a rendered version of the documentation at https://jakelishman.github.io/qutip-devguide. Some design documents:; - [data layer](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-doc/blob/design-data-layer/design/01-data-time-layer-separation.md); - [data structure implementation choices](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-doc/blob/design-data-layer/design/02-data-structures.md); - [original GSoC proposal (PDF)](https://www.binhbar.com/posts/2020/05/welcome-to-google-summer-of-code-2020/proposal.pdf). New design elements under consideration:; - [improved `'type'` and `'dims'` handling for tensor-product spaces](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320). Major breaking changes to QuTiP:; - `Qobj.data` is no longer an instance of `scipy.sparse.spmatrix`, but the new abstract ""data-layer type"" `core.data",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278:549,log,logical,549,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278,2,['log'],"['logic', 'logical']"

As far as I can tell this XIO error is related to the xvfb module (pytest-xvfb) used to manage graphical tests without display. Some relevant discussion is found at https://github.com/The-Compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues/11 . They indicate there that this error can be triggered if windows managed by Xvfb are not properly closed before completing tests. So it's likely it's related to tests using matplotlib. The only test using matplot lib is testPlot in test_processor.py. Sure enough, if testPlot is skipped then test_processor.py passes successfully without triggering the XIO error. **To Reproduce**.

Testability,"`Qobj` has some fast-path constructors that are basically the solvers saying ""this data is valid, just trust me"", causing it to skip sanity checks. There are a few slow points that can be skipped: copying unnecessary data, parsing/verifying the `dims` data, and determining the properties (`isherm`, `iscp`, etc). All of those add on very non-negligible construction time, but at most points in QuTiP we _know_ the values when passing them. Old-style code uses these magic ""fast-path"" constructors, but the new 5.0 branch gets rid of all of them - you can achieve much more, and more explicitly, by using the kwargs, and function-specific logic stays at the call location, rather than being bolted into `Qobj`. We still want to maintain passing `isherm` to `Qobj` when we know it for speed reasons, especially when we know the most common use of the `Qobj` created by `mesolve` is for finding expectation values. However, you can set the value based on the hermicity of the input density matrix; if you're passed a true density matrix, you'll always get a Hermitian matrix out, whereas you'll generally be in an unknown state if you're not. The test can be; ```python; def mesolve(H, rho0, tlist, ...):; hermicity = rho0.isherm or None; ...; for t in tlist:; output.states.append(Qobj(fdata, dims=dims, isherm=hermicity)); ```; which forces `isherm=True` if that's _known_, but leaves it unset if not. This is approximately how we handle things in 5.0, which is in part why we have huge reductions in `Qobj` construction time in the new version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1460#issuecomment-796689049:639,log,logic,639,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1460#issuecomment-796689049,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"

Testability,"`__array_wrap__` for coercion back (something that isn't currently implemented). At the time and up to inclusively 1.19, the presence of `__array__` caused otherwise scalar types passed alone to `np.array` to return the output of `input.__array__(*args, **kwargs)`, instead of becoming a 0D numpy array (like `np.array(1)` does). Taken purely alone, that could make sense as something we implement. However, this also implies that `Qobj` should fulfil the numpy ufunc interface; `Qobj` would be a container for data such that operations like `np.sin` is the elementwise sin, or (most notably) `np.multiply` is the *elementwise* multiplication. Our `Qobj` _does not_ fulfil the ufunc interface:; 1. elementwise operations don't make sense on quantum objects, which are arrays only as an implementation detail - the `Qobj` class is meant to represent an abstract linear algebra object, not specifically a matrix.; 2. we don't honour the `shape` guarantees of numpy as we test compatibility based on `dims`, which are not 1D (superoperators) so cannot follow numpy's broadcasting rules; 3. we treat multiplication as matrix multiplication, violating how `np.multiply` should behave. My main concern is point 1: I don't think that `Qobj` provides a similar object to an `ndarray` at all. Right now we _do_ use matrices underneath, but proposed additions to QuTiP such as symbolic `Qobj` and adaptive Hilbert spaces are compatible with the idea of ""abstract linear algebra objects"", but do not necessarily have a backing array. Point 2 is mostly an extension of that: I'm not sure there is a sensible way for numpy's broadcasting rules to be applied to quantum objects as they exist now, even without extensions. ## More control over dispatch: `__array_ufunc__` and `__array_function__`.

Testability,"`auto-tidyup` exist to remove 0s stored in sparse matrices. `auto-tidyup` is quite messy, rounding all values under 1e-12 to 0 per default after each matrix operation can only cause problems. . As for the benchmark, why ask for dense operations to add an extra step to increase their outputs error to the same level as sparse operations so their benchmark do not look to good in comparisons. I think it is fair that the sparse operation's timing include the time needed to manage it's structure. . For auto-differentiation, if operations included are done with `Qobj`, it would have to differentiate tidy-up steps after each operation. But since the tidy-up operation does not have a clean derivative (`out[out < 1e-12] = 0`) it will make the auto-differentiation very inefficient. I see `auto-tidyup` more as a necessary evil to keep sparse matrix efficient. I would argue that we should not have `auto-tidyup` in `Qobj` and have sparse matrix operation clean themselves instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881709826:205,benchmark,benchmark,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881709826,2,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

Testability,"`scipy` 1.5 has changed some of its private attributes for matrix multiplication (to a _much_ better name!), and so matrix-matrix multiplication is completely broken for us at the moment: see scipy/scipy@53fac7a. There's also been some changes to how Hermitian eigenvalues and vectors are calculated (which actually is good news for us in general), which may has a bit of a knock-on for some of the `zheevr` tests, which is going to be a bit of a nuisance to fix. To avoid polluting this PR with (any more) off-topic discussion, I've opened #1299. The new data layer types will fix the matrix multiplication issue permanently, because we'll not be duplicating/reusing large tracts of `scipy` private code - we have our own Cython versions that operate faster on more optimised types.

The syntax of output of command ; ```; sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; ``` ; has been changed. The output for previous MacOS: ; ```; $ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz\n; ```. The updated output; ```; $ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; VirtualApple @ 2.50GHz processor\n; ```. Therefore, the function [`_mac_hardware_info`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/cb201690a2ca3a9c904bc642ef6600f2ef54f763/qutip/hardware_info.py#L48) of file `hardware_info.py` cannot parse the frequency of CPU correctly. The popped error information is attached below. ```; ValueError: could not convert string to float: ' 2.50GHz proces'; ```. This pull request fix this problem and compatible with both syntax of hardware information. . Since the unit tests of file or function are not found, I do not add test files for this change.

If you have not finished them all, you can also open a [Draft Pull Request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to let the others know this on-going work and keep this checklist in the PR description.; -->. **Description**; Importing qutip takes a long time. On a Windows system import takes almost 4 seconds. The import time can be analyzed with [importtime-waterfall](https://github.com/asottile/importtime-waterfall). A large part of the time is spend in importing external packages (scipy, IPython, matplotilib), but also qutip itself adds to the import time. This PR reduces the import time by setting the logger names in 4 submodules explicitly. ; Benchmark:; ```; python -c ""import time; import matplotlib; import IPython; import scipy; t0=time.time(); import qutip; dt=time.time()-t0; print(f'{dt*1e3:.2f} ms')""; ``` ; Results:; ```; dev.major: 1996.52 ms; PR: 1510.06 ms; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1980:1750,log,logger,1750,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1980,2,"['Benchmark', 'log']","['Benchmark', 'logger']"

Testability,"at of the repository. First, a couple of arguments against doing so:; - the versions in `scipy` and `qutip` did subsequently diverge in some form, because they no longer universally give the same results, possibly as a result of #654.; - the `qutip` version of `reverse_cuthill_mckee` is about 10% faster than the `scipy` version; - people may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],; [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]); ```; we get; ```; qutip: [9, 6, 7, 1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 3, 8]; matlab: [0, 8, 5, 7, 3, 6, 4, 2, 1, 9]; ```; (where I converte",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:1399,assert,assert,1399,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['assert'],['assert']
Testability,"at this is probably a subtle point which the user might overlook but using `np.dot(spre(Q).full(), rho)` take ns while the more readable `spre(Q)*vec` takes us. In most cases, we get away with this since we always pack the elements in `spre` into a sparse Liouvillian and invoke `cy_ode_rhs` but if there was some way to modify the `.__mul__` method of superoperators to use `np.dot`, it might be helpful to get up to 1000x speed improvement. This comes of use when the RHS is calculated on the fly by the action of these superoperators (eg., the Heom method). The comparisons are below. I pre-compute all the *operators* and *vectors* before running `%timeit` and these are the timing for the matrix-vector multiplication only. @nwlambert @ajgpitch Should we do something about this or mention it somewhere if it is important?. ```; np.dot(spre(Q).full(), vec); 789 ns ± 6.68 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each). spre(Q).data * vec; 5.66 µs ± 57.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each). spre(Q)*vec; 7.35 µs ± 213 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each). spre(Q)*operator_to_vector(rho); 62.5 µs ± 1.73 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each); ```.

Testability,"at. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using globbing; - version information is now stored in a single-line file `VERSION`. This is mostly for CI reasons; it's much easier to parse and override at the CI level when it's a single file, rather than attempting `sed s/.../.../ setup.py` or something crazy like that. The validity of the version string is tested by regex.; - local version information is now _always_ appended, even if `git` isn't present - the local version is just then ""nogit"" rather than the git shorthash; - `setup.py` gained a new `--release` flag or environment variable `CI_QUTIP_RELEASE`; the only effect right now is to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the code. ### Notes on the wheels. Currently I build only for CPython. I haven't tried to build pypy wheels, but we _may_ support it - Cython does in theory, but I think complex numbers and raw pointers aren't handled completely smoothly, and we make heavy use of both. We get `manylinux1` builds for Linux, which is the oldest `manylinux` spec. This can be updated in the future, but I'm not sure I see a need; all our heavy mathematical lifting is either done by custom code (which is mostly immune) or BLAS/LAPACK (which we link to dynamically), so I don't think there's much to be gained.

I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by ""`mesolve` is re-entrant"" or whether recent changes in QuTiP now use a re-entrant internal integrator, i.e. not `scipy.integrate.ode`. At the time I implemented the [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) by looking at what `mesolve` was doing at a low level for the specific case of density matrices, `scipy.integrate.ode` was definitely being used, and that couldn't handle propagating in parallel (and by ""parallel"" I include alternating propagation steps from two different propagations). I'm also not sure what using `QobjEvo` does: In the benchmarking, there didn't seem to be any difference whether I wrap my nested lists into `QobjEvo` or not. Is there something specific that `QobjEvo` should enable that I can't do with nested lists?. > QuTiP 5 is (probably) going to formalise that (^) sort of low-level calling convention of `mesolve`, but it should work already. The new one look a bit different because instead of doing the setup very manually, there'll be a ""low-level"" function to prepare a master equation problem (and a Schrodinger equation one, etc), and then there'll be a `step` method instead of calling the ""high-level"" interface function `mesolve`, but functionally it'll do largely the same, just with a lot less data copying than the current form has to do. In the new system, it's likely that the function `mesolve` itself will keep the exact same interface it has now, just internally most of its processing will be split into modular components, each of which will be accessible (with different names) to the user to compose themselves, if the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:7600,benchmark,benchmarking,7600,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

Testability,"cially with quite how many names `qutip` exports. The `from qutip.very.deep.nested.module import name` is certainly good, and I think I've generally left those. I think I started converting in a few places because there were things like `from qutip import Cubic_Spline` and `from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline`, and then the test was unreadable as to which was which. Having `qutip.Cubic_Spline` and `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` is unambiguous. The smaller cases like `from qutip import Qobj` are highly unlikely to have any conflicts, but in general I just went for consistency. That all said, there's certainly arguments both ways, e.g. explicit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves.

Testability,"ct? Dictionary support was not tested and supported only for some solver for a long time. It ; > would be strange to have it become the default. Well, this is v5 -- we are trying to make things nicer. The issue with lists of e_ops is that often the e_ops have no sensible ordering. E.g. if the e_ops are, say, the number operator and projectors on to two different bases of interest then `[qutip.num(N), proj1, proj2]` are later accessed as `.expect[0]`, `.expect[1]` and `.expect[2]` which are then unreadable and fairly arbitrary and unmemorable numbers. Having `.expect[""num""]`, `.expect[""proj1""]` and `.expect[""proj2""]` is much more readable and will result in fewer mistakes. I *really* like the dict interface because it gives this readability to results. I'm happy to accept that others may prefer lists, but providing multiple interfaces creates a problem for any code working with results. So it is a bit of tricky question to resolve. > For MC result, it has little impact, dict are a little more annoying to work with compared to list, but it need the expect as ndarray; not list or dict anyway. The MC result classes already have to work around these things in awkward ways, and probably need to be a lot more careful -- e.g. e_ops functions can return strange things like Qobjs or perhaps even stranger things like strings or dicts which can't be averaged over. > There are a some differences for the user. Code using `np.array(result.expect)` or `for expect in result.expect:` will break. Agreed, although unless `result.expect` contains a uniform set of things, this are probably not sensible things to be doing. I have some other ideas but I think they make more of a mess -- e.g. keep `.expect` a list but provide `.expect_d` which is a dict. If one needs to write v4 compatible code one can always pass a list of e_ops and then work with `.expect` a bit carefully (i.e. as a dict). Thoughts?. I have added tests now, so it's just the `.expect` issue to resolve for this PR, I think.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1907#issuecomment-1141326041:1959,test,tests,1959,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1907#issuecomment-1141326041,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"d_col)),; shape=(nds**2, nds**2),; dtype=np.complex128); ```; and recompile. If you want to make a PR of something similar against QuTiP, I'll accept it. I would actually file this against `scipy.sparse` - I think our usage is completely in line with the contract of `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` and they've got a bug in their dtype handling. You currently can't construct a CSR matrix using the COO triplet format for complex data, unless the dtype is made explicit _somewhere_, but the constructor is meant to correctly infer a suitable dtype if one is not passed. Basic Scipy reproducer to illustrate the problem:; ```python; >>> import scipy.sparse; >>> scipy.__version__; '1.6.1'; >>> scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(([1+1j], ([0], [0])), shape=(2, 2)); Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>; File ""/Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/qutip-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scipy/sparse/compressed.py"", line 54, in __init__; other = self.__class__(coo_matrix(arg1, shape=shape,; File ""/Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/qutip-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scipy/sparse/coo.py"", line 161, in __init__; self.data = np.array(obj, copy=copy, dtype=data_dtype); TypeError: can't convert complex to float; ```. This can be fixed either by passing `dtype=np.complex128` to the constructor, or passing the data inside a NumPy array, since that'll also fix the dtype. I imagine with their implicit conversions, SciPy may also need to test the special cases where all list elements are things like `1+0j`, which have type `complex` but can be safely represented by reals - the Python call `float(1 + 0j)` is forbidden even though the imaginary part is 0. I actually originally thought this was the problem in this issue, since all the Lindbladian data tested is real numbers with complex type. I suppose it's up to SciPy to decide how they want to handle that case - either always maintaining `complex` or putting in a special-case cast (`np.real(x)`) for known-safe complex -> float conversions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1451#issuecomment-784265398:1770,test,test,1770,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1451#issuecomment-784265398,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"dnorm tests have historically been very flaky, and for as long as we're using random tests (which we possibly shouldn't be), we always run the risk of temperamental failures. In particular, the semidefinite solvers used in dnorm fail every now and again on random states; we historically haven't treated this as a bug, since it's pretty similar to an integration failing to converge because the system was too stiff. It means that the user has to adjust some settings and try again. To prevent this sort of error from failing our test suite, however, we can mark the tests as being allowed to rerun twice on a failure. We had a relatively small sample to judge the test failure rate by, but my very very approximate guess is that we'd have a failure about 1 in 10 runs on Travis. We counter this with two strategies:. 1. parametrise the tests in pytest style, so each random repetition is a separate instance, and known to pytest (some of this was done in earlier commits); 2. allow 2 reruns of every dnorm test. The two of these together should remove all random failures; since all random loops have been moved into pytest-handled repeats, there are far fewer calls to dnorm handled within each test. This means less chance that an individual test run will fail, but a slightly higher chance the entire suite will. Now with the test re-running a single failure point is tried again up to twice more, to determine if it was just a one-off, or if the test is truly broken. The reruns are handled by a pytest plugin pytest-rerunfailures. It's quite nontrivial behaviour to hook this in to the pytest mechanism, so better to use an external dependency to do it than to vendor in a custom version. The dnorm problems have resurfaced a little after lying dormant for a long time, because #1463 reactivated them. Before that, they'd not actually been running because none of the test runners had cvxpy installed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490:6,test,tests,6,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490,12,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"e fixtures at whatever level is appropriate. In this particular case, I scoped the `dimension` fixture at the module level, because there's loads of places that needed to test varying dimensions, and it's very convenient to define it just once. In the few cases where we needed to override that (e.g. in `dnorm`), I overrode it by providing a definition in a tighter scope - either at class level or per-function (via `pytest.mark.parametrize` directly). The correct scoping just depends a lot on the type of tests you're writing - if you're going to have to overwrite something constantly then module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706:1204,test,tests,1204,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"e just dump out some information. ## Things you should know if you've not worked with segfaults before. - `Abort trap 6`, `Segmentation fault` and a few other points can all be from the same cause; - Segmentation faults are typically caused by reading or writing to memory that isn't owned by our process. These often occur by reading/writing too much data to an allocated pointer, or trying to read/write a memory location where the location was read from uninitialised memory.; - Segfaults will not always reliably occur. It's _very_ difficult to prove that swapping tools ""fixes"" a segfault; it can often just move around enough allocations to mask the problem, not fix it.; - Python stack traces are likely to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, wh",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807:1248,test,test,1248,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"e rules:. - `Compound(Map(x1, y1), Map(x2, y2))` is `Map(Compound(x1, x2), Compound(y1, y2))`; - `Compound(Map(x1, y1), Space(z))` is `Map(Compound(x1, Field), Compound(y1, Space(z)))`. In other words, the `from` and `to` fields inside maps are `Compound`ed with their counterparts, and `Space` is ""promoted"" to `Map(Field, Space)`. This latter object is not actually valid, but `Space` will behave as if it were within `Compound`. Related but different, `Compound(Field, Field)` will exist for the purposes of tensor-product `'bra'` types as the `to` field of `Map` (to allow us to keep track of empty spaces), but a `Qobj` whose dimensions would be a `Compound` made entirely of `Field` will instead become a Python complex number. The dimensions types should be available for advanced users (to allow them to access the full parsing speed-ups), but should not be presented as the standard choice. I propose we place the types inside a nested namespace, such as `qutip.dims` (logically - physically it would be `qutip/core/dims.py`), to allow the form `from qutip.dims import *` where appropriate without forcing the user to do the modern bad practice left over from our MATLAB past `from qutip import *`. ## User impact. In principle, nothing will change for the normal QuTiP user compared to the 4.x branch. You will still be able to supply the `dims` argument to the `Qobj` constructor as lists in the exact same format, and they will be parsed in the same way. Users _do not_ need to type out the new computer-friendly dimensions objects, but they will be available for advanced users who frequently make `Qobj` using the raw constructor with funny dimensions. We will publicly provide `qutip.dims.parse` to turn a list into the new form, so even advanced users do not need to type out all the nonsense. `Qobj` factory functions that take a `dims` parameter should now also accept the new form. Since almost all of them just pass this directly to the `dims` argument in the `Qobj` constructor, t",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421:9573,log,logically,9573,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421,1,['log'],['logically']
Testability,"e the bug**; Currently qutip is requiring scipy > 1.12 and in the CI checks scipy <1.5 is being checked. There was a bug in scipy 1.4 See [.Stackoverflow error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54314529/mkl-error-parameter-12-for-large-matrices-with-scipy-linalg-eigvalsh-in-an) , [bug report ](scipy/scipy#8205) that has been fixed by this [solution](scipy/scipy#11304) in the 1.5 release. This is related to the `linalg.eigh() API` which performs eigenvalue calculation, it causes error of this form `Intel MKL ERROR: Parameter 12 was incorrect on entry to ZHBRDB`, which mostly the get silenced, and instead of terminating it just outputs an array of zeros except for the last entry. This issue occurs exclusively when using the API with high dimensional tensors, which are probably not being handled in the tests, but will inevitably cause miscalculations for the users as eigenvalue finding of hermitics is pervasive. **To Reproduce**; Just as an illustration you cun run . `pytest qutip/tests/test_superop_reps.py -s -k SuperChoiChi`. from the codes in #1491 in an environment like the generated for `coverage` tests in the CI. The terminal out put is; ```; qutip/tests/test_superop_reps.py ..; Intel MKL ERROR: Parameter 12 was incorrect on entry to ZHBRDB.; F. ================================================================= FAILURES ==================================================================; _________________________________________________ TestSuperopReps.test_SuperChoiChiSuper[8] _________________________________________________. self = <qutip.tests.test_superop_reps.TestSuperopReps object at 0x7f01d2d5c6d0>, dimension = 8. @pytest.mark.parametrize('dimension', [2, 4, 8]); def test_SuperChoiChiSuper(self, dimension):; """"""; Superoperator: Converting two-qubit superoperator through; Choi and chi representations goes back to right superoperator.; """"""; superoperator = super_tensor(rand_super(dimension), rand_super(dimension)); ; choi_matrix = to_choi(superoperator); ch",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1495:1005,test,tests,1005,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1495,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"ector (using `gate_expand_1toN`), and the added code (dense local). N being the number of qubits. Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions). I didn't do this yet as thought i'd see what thoughts are on this -- I can easily add this.~~ **Update (20/12/20)**: I just added some basic functionality for this. Will need to add more tests and maybe re-work it a bit still. 3. Currently the input local operator is expected to be square, and we do not take output dimension arguments. This means it keeps the system dimensions the same. This can be relaxed easily, but we probably need an additional output dimension list, which needs to be consistent with the input operator. Again, this is easy to do, but was not sure if it is needed. If I get time I might add this anyway. 4. There are some examples of the code in the docstring to see how to run it (and also in the tests of course). I also have offline a script to perform certain speed comparisons (vs the sparse routine), I can share some more results of that. I figured this type of script shouldn't go into the project, but I can also add this. **Changelog**; Added a local multiplication routine, to speed up certain dense matrix operations.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405:2683,test,tests,2683,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"ement.density_measurement(self, measurement_ops, state)` : This adds generalized state/density matrix measurements given a list of observables. Still needs addition of checks to see if the list of observables is valid ; - `Measurement.measurement_comp_basis(self, state)` : This adds measurement statistics for specific qubit measurements in the computational basis and also returns the collapsed states (without changing the dimensions). ; - `QubitCircuit.run(self, state, cbits)`: Given a ket input to the circuit, applies gates and measurements from the circuit and returns the resultant ket. . Right now, the measurement module is very bare-bones and splintered between the previous code ; from @hodgestar and the new code added by me. The eigenstate based measurements are slightly different than the measurements usually used on circuits (or I might be missing something). Ofc, in the case of measurements on all qubits, they amount to the same result. I have not added tests yet but I have added a basic quantum teleportation notebook. It will be nice to get feedback on testing methods as well as what kind of notebooks the community is interested in. Also, any other feature requests on this module would also be appreciated. . PS: I have also added measurement code from Simon's PR here so maybe we can either add him as a contributor to this PR or figure out something else. ; ; Update: . 1. Addressing some concerns about the PR containing multiple diverging pieces of code, I think classical registers, measurement on the circuit and the classically-controlled gates are best grouped together as they all rely on each other in some ways. The valid concern is that of the Measurement class encapsulating all projective style measurements. I also want to point out that it was raised by @BoxiLi that we may want to move the Gate class and Measurement class completely to qutip.qip.operations to which I agree but I believe that should be addressed in a clean-up PR with naming changes sugg",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274:2212,test,tests,2212,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"en module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better and easier to read as time went on. (The later files haven't been converted yet.) The main things are to always be thinking about readability both of the code and the error messages that are coming out, and making sure that your tests are really testing that your functions have your behaviour you want them to have. Another thing we really don't have enough of in QuTiP yet is tests for ""negative"" behaviour, i.e. testing that functions _fail_ when they're passed incorrect inputs - consequently, quite a lot of QuTiP actually will just silently do the wrong thing if it's passed nonsense.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706:1959,test,testing,1959,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706,6,['test'],"['testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"er than a hard limit, but it's a good rule of thumb for testing one piece of functionality. [Here's a (slightly out-dated) list of our current longest tests](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604116373), bearing in mind that some of those ones actually test many many things in the same test function. The test seems structured ok to me. Certainly the testing algorithm isn't the major cause of speed loss. You could try timing some ""real-world"" examples of using your measurements, and try running them in a profiler to see if there are any obvious ways to speed things up. With any luck the new data-layer tools and the possibility of using dense `Qobj` storage will give you a fair amount of speed-up once they're complete, since I imagine in your small circuit you're paying quite a lot of sparse matrix overhead. I'll prefix this last part with: _you should always profile your code before optimising it_. That said, let me wildly break that rule and guess at where I think you'll find big speed-ups: caching and pre-computation. If you know you're going to run the same thing loads and loads of times, then you shouldn't have to call `self.propagators` each time, or build `measurement_ops` inside `measure_comp_basis`. Do those once at the start of `run_statistics`, and save them. Minor things that _may_ speed up - check the profiling!; 1. ""compress"" the output of `self.propagators`: consecutive propagators with no measurements or classical controls inbetween can be pre-multiplied together at the start to make one matrix. This will save you ~3 matrix multiplications per run in the test.; 2. use more efficient ways to construct large tensor spaces: `qutip.basis`, `qutip.projection` and `qutip.qeye` can all directly constructor product spaces (e.g. `qutip.basis([2, 2, 2], [0, 1, 0])`). `tensor` is a comparatively expensive operation, and tensoring a list of elements internally is effectively `tensor(...(tensor(tensor(els[0], els[1]), els[2]), ...), els[-1])`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-640127213:1669,test,test,1669,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-640127213,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"er, so it reports all tests that took longer than a second to run. This should really help identify where the real problems in our testing are - right now you should see that there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now. All the test runners now start up almost instantly, which really solves a lot of the slowdown we were getting on Travis. The actual speeds of the Linux VMs seem to be similar to what we had on Travis - the walltimes are slightly longer because I now install _all_ optional dependencies in most runners, so slightly more gets tested than before. Currently there's also a slowdown on several machines because `cvxpy` doesn't build many wheels, and none at all for Linux, on `pip`. I install all our dependencies except BLAS/LAPACK stuff that way, since it's easiest to read out the dependencies like that. We can potentially save some build time (maybe ~3 minutes?) if we install that from conda-forge instead. I also fixed a minor point of how environment variables are read within `setup.py` (in the end I didn't actually use the new behaviour in the action, but I did during testing), and added a warning filter on dnorm tests to account for a deprecated Numpy alias being used within `cvxpy` code.

As far as I can tell this XIO error is related to the xvfb module (pytest-xvfb) used to manage graphical tests without display. Some relevant discussion is found at https://github.com/The-Compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues/11 . They indicate there that this error can be triggered if windows managed by Xvfb are not properly closed before completing tests. So it's likely it's related to tests using matplotlib. The only test using matplot lib is testPlot in test_processor.py. Sure enough, if testPlot is skipped then test_processor.py passes successfully without triggering the XIO error. **To Reproduce**.

Testability,"erator_to_vector`; - all ""legacy"" files have been completely removed; - all previous scipy-CSR-like Cython code is completely gone (replaced by the data layer); - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so will not automatically turn itself into one. Having this produced very inconsistent behaviour when multiplying by numpy arrays, or otherwise dealing with numpy functions. If you _need_ `Qobj` to be array, be explicit and call `Qobj.full()`. Notable changes in `Qobj`:; - matrix multiplication now contracts to a scalar if doing `bra @ ket`; - matrix multiplication no longer contracts 1D subspaces, but the new `Qobj.contract()` will do this; - arithmetic operations are much more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication, but also maintains the same behaviour of treating `Qobj * Qobj` as matrix multiplication. Package organisation:; - the solvers are now physically contained in `qutip.solve`, but are still logically available in the `qutip` namespace. This means that direct imports (like `from qutip.mesolve import mesolve`) will fail (it becomes `from qutip.solve.mesolve import mesolve`), but the ""proper"" unqualified access `from qutip import mesolve` remains unchanged. This is for internal code organisation purposes. The integral type used as the indices in the `CSR` type is now done by simple typedef in the files `qutip/core/data/base.{pyx,pxd}`, so changes it in those two files at compile-time will allow you to switch between 32-bit and 64-bit. The C++ backing source file `zspmv.cpp` and its associated header are renamed to `matmul_csr_vector` to match the new data-layer naming conventions, but more importantly, the functions are now templated over integral types so they will ""magically"" work at either size.

Testability,"es in each respective case. The reason the tests are a little bit slow compared to, e.g., the tests in `TestMESolveTDDecay` is the computation of the fidelity of the states at all the different times. If you think the tests are too slow, i can change them, and for example only check the fidelity of the final state. As a side note: As I wrote this new functionality, I also ran some simple tests comparing a pure python implementation of the right hand side for `_mesolve_const` to the cython implementation (I did this because I was considering how much cython code I had to write, or if a pure python implementation of the new functionality would suffice). I actually found that a pure python implementation was as fast (or maybe slightly _faster_) than the cython implementation. The pure python implementation of the right hand side is simply (see lines 767-769 of mesolve.py). ``` python; def _ode_rho_test(t, rho, data):; # for performance comparison of cython code; return data*(np.transpose(rho)); ```. Here is a plot of the performance compare to the standard cython implementation for a very simple test. The benchmark was a damped-cavity JC-model with Hilbert space dimension 4 for the cavity, integrated up to ""integration time"". ""run time"" is the real run time on my laptop. ![benchmark](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2354542/11615553/48fe8604-9c32-11e5-83b9-2de366bd3cef.png). Since there is no big difference between the cython implementation and the pure python implementation (if anything, the pure python implementation is slightly faster), maybe it makes sense to replace the call to `cy_ode_rhs` with a call to `_ode_rhs_test` (see lines 744 to 747 in mesolve.py)? This makes the code a tiny bit easier to read. Of course, this was a single, very simplistic test. Sorry about all the merge commits. I'm still learning good workflow for this type of feature branch. Will use rebasing more in the future.

Testability,"es occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions which depend on those. It comes with the same disadvantage of relatively tight coupling, but is somehow more flexible and powerful than just setting the seeds.; - I have used Hypothesis in the past (on a relatively small-scale project), and it's indeed a great framework with a lot of interesting and nice functionalities. I like it very much, but one disadvantage I ran into was the increased overall time for completion of a test run. In my case, a viable approach, for instance, was to run my Hypothesis tests (which were a subset of all tests) with a bit larger periodicity (in the CI pipeline) than the regular tests. Another concern that I intuitively have (I may be _wildly_ wrong on this one, though, not having yet properly explored QuTiP's testing landscape) is that - depending on how some Hypothesis tests are set up - th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:1831,mock,mock,1831,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,1,['mock'],['mock']

Testability,"gcc 4.4 does not support the `-flto` option for link time optimization. This is still a common compiler because it is the system gcc in centos 6 and redhat enterprise 6. In this pull request I've removed that option. Users who need this could set the CCFLAGS environment variable to customize the compiler flags. Alternatively, we could add options to `setup.py` to enable or disable link time optimization. I've also added additional rows to the travis build matrix to test building with gcc 4.4 and clang. In its current form this adds 4 additional rows to the build matrix (2 additional compilers, each tested with python 2.7 and 3.4). Let me know if you think this is excessive.

Testability,"h`: see https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/3751. I suggest we consider dropping most of them, and consequently their surrounding `Cython` code to ease maintainability and reduce code bloat of the repository. First, a couple of arguments against doing so:; - the versions in `scipy` and `qutip` did subsequently diverge in some form, because they no longer universally give the same results, possibly as a result of #654.; - the `qutip` version of `reverse_cuthill_mckee` is about 10% faster than the `scipy` version; - people may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],; [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],;",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:1198,test,tests,1198,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"he initial floquet modes, computing the propagator over one period, then using these to compute at other time, recomputing the propagator up to that time. When the modes at multiple times were needed, we could compute a list of them over one period using `floquet_modes_table`, but at least 2 computations over a period were needed. With the and the `Propagator` memoize capacities added in v5, only one computation of the propagator is required. Also with the table computation of v4, if a mode was not included in the table, the closest one was used. `fmesolve ` and `fsesolve` computed 100 slices over the period. It did not used the values in `tlist` and caused artifacts in the result. With `FloquetBasis`, the mode are always computed at the exact time. . I left the v4's functions with warnings. The construction of the floquet tensor was done using 2 functions: `floquet_master_equation_rates` which returned 4 tensors and `floquet_master_equation_tensor`. I added `floquet_tensor` which computed the tensor in one call and split `floquet_master_equation_rates` in 4 functions, one for each of the outputs. Floquet, like `brmesolve`, need a function for the noise power spectrum. Unlike `brmesolve`, string are not supported, only functions. We should have them match, but supporting string is quite heavy since coefficient are not a great fit. `fsesolve` have been rewritten without the class interface. As an integrator, the floquet method has no advantage since the propagator much be computed using another method. `fmesolve` work similarly to other solver. The `e_ops` are always in the laboratory basis. The result states are also in the laboratory basis. The option `""store_floquet_states""` is used to store the states in the floquet basis in `result.floquet_states`. In v4, there it an option for the environment temperature, but no tests for it. I kept the feature, but it's still untested.; Also all tests for `fmesolve` are either for constant systems or without collapse operator.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034:2164,test,tests,2164,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"icit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command l",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:1846,log,logic,1846,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tests']"

Testability,"ilities that are different from their true prefactor in the initial state. The ratio between the sampling frequencies and true prefactors would be weights on the trajectories. This also fixes some things in merging `McResult`s and `NmmcResult`s, and perhaps fixes the target tolerance computation for the ""improved sampling"" option. **Implementation**. A difficulty in the implementation is that the weights depend on the total number of trajectories in different ways. For example, the no-jump trajectory has a fixed weight that never changes, but all other trajectories come with prefactors $(1-p_0) / (N-1)$ where $p_0$ is the probability of the no-jump trajectory, and $N$ the total number of trajectories (including the one no-jump trajectory). For this reason, I separate weights into *absolute weights* (like $p_0$) and *relative weights* (like the others). The average is performed as follows:. $$ \bar\rho = \sum_{T: \text{abs}} w_a(T) w_r(T) \rho(T) + \frac{1}{N_{\text{rel}}} \sum _{T: \text{rel}} w_r(T) \rho(T) $$. where the first sum is over all trajectories T that have absolute weights, and the second sum over all other trajectories. Here, $w_a(T)$ and $w_r(T)$ are the absolute and relative weights, $\rho(T)$ the state associated with a trajectory, and $N_{\text{rel}}$ the number of trajectories that have not been assigned absolute weights. Intuitively, the idea is that absolute weights are for trajectories where the contribution to the full state is known exactly, and the trajectories without absolute weights are the stochastic part. **Things to do**; - [x] Update tests and create new ones; - [x] Update photocurrent to work with weights; - [x] Update target tolerance calculation to work with weights; - [x] Think about how result objects should be added if both contain trajectories with absolute weights; - [x] Double-check that this creates no problems for stochastic solvers; - [x] Towncrier entry. **Related issues or PRs**; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2235",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2369:2425,test,tests,2425,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2369,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"in `math.factorial` is deprecated as of Python 3.9. Glancing over the rest of the code, I'm fairly sure `math.factorial` is only called on floats formed by (e.g.) `N / 2 + 0.5`, which is guaranteed be an integer for all odd `N` integers, but to be safe I inserted the same test that `math.factorial` will do as well. By the way: depending on how accurate you actually want/need to be with your degeneracy calculations, a common way to deal with these binomial quantities is to work in the logarithmic space --; ```python; def factln(x):; return scipy.special.gammaln(x + 1). def energy_degeneracy(N, m):; return int(np.exp(Decimal(factln(N) - factln(N/2 + m) - factln(N/2 - m)))); ```; This is pretty much guaranteed to be faster, but a little less precise; double-precision floats have ~15 decimal digits of precision compared to the `Decimal` default of 28. You have to be careful that the `np.exp` call doesn't overflow (unless you can use the number in logarithmic space as well), but you can just use a single `Decimal` instance like I did if it really matters to you to have huuuuge numbers output. I suspect it doesn't, since you multiply it by a float right after, which will overflow to `inf`. Timings:; ```python; from math import factorial; from decimal import Decimal; import numpy as np; from scipy.special import gammaln. def degeneracy_all_decimal(N, m):; return int(Decimal(factorial(N)) / (Decimal(factorial(int(N/2+m))) * Decimal(factorial(int(N/2-m))))). def degeneracy_log_then_decimal(N, m):; return int(np.exp(Decimal(gammaln(N+1) - gammaln(N/2+m+1) - gammaln(N/2-m+1)))). def degeneracy_log(N, m):; return int(np.exp(gammaln(N+1) - gammaln(N/2+m+1) - gammaln(N/2-m+1))); ```; ```python; In [3]: %timeit degeneracy_all_decimal(1000, 0); ...: %timeit degeneracy_log_then_decimal(1000, 0); ...: %timeit degeneracy_log(1000, 0); 831 µs ± 1.91 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each); 31.9 µs ± 190 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each); 4.63 ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1550:983,log,logarithmic,983,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1550,1,['log'],['logarithmic']

Testability,"ine this into a single pull request instead of splitting it up into many smaller ones (but this could be done). The changes in more detail:; - `state_number_enumerate` and `state_index_number` now always return tuples. Before, `state_number_enumerate` returned arrays for `excitations is None` and tuples otherwise, and `state_index_number` returned a list. For `excitations is None`, I realized that a simple call to `itertools.product` is enough, and is about 20x faster for a (relatively big) test case. It would be trivial to keep returning arrays instead of tuples here as before, but this slows the code down (quite significantly, in fact) and, in any case, returning arrays or tuples depending on whether `excitations` is set seems like an inconsistent interface, so I decided to make it consistent (and faster). I checked that the uses in the code base should not be affected. The algorithm used when the number of excitations is restricted is a slightly more elegant version of the one from my previous pull request (#1594), and is faster by another factor of 5 or more for the ""big"" test cases I looked at. ~~It is still recursive, but quite fast, and I did not find an elegant non-recursive algorithm.~~ I came up with an even faster non-recursive algorithm after all. It's arguably a bit less elegant, but I think still readable, and another 50% or so faster than the previous one (see the second commit below).; - `enr_state_dictionaries` now returns a dictionary and a list instead of two dictionaries. Before, `idx2state` was a dictionary with integer keys from 0 to nstates-1, which behaves essentially like a list. However, before Python 3.7, iteration order was not guaranteed to be insertion order (i.e., iterating over the dictionary could give the indices and states in any order, and it seems to me that `enr_thermal_dm`, which did exactly that, was not guaranteed to work).; - `state_number_index` and `state_index_number` now just call `np.ravel_multi_index` and `np.unravel_i",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1604:1357,test,test,1357,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1604,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ing clearer in the code - some of the earlier parametrizations I did were too aggressive because I wasn't used to the tools yet. The `test_control_pulseoptim` parts are very complex, in part because the underlying calling convention of that code is complex too. I'll try and add more comments to it to ease that along, especially in the part where I just defined a load of systems to test. That certainly should have been commented. There are general comments about what I was using the `pytest` tooling for in the commit messages, but I didn't necessarily want to leave ""intro to pytest"" comments throughout, because it would mostly crowd out the actual tests, and the `pytest` documentation online is probably going to be a better explanation than what I can do. I'm also learning `pytest` by doing this (I'd not used it before I opened the first PR)!. About the PRs: I'm happy with whatever workflow works best for you guys - I don't have any control over when the PR gets merged. It might be a little difficult for me to maintain two branches at once (i.e. if the first PR with ~10 tests is awaiting merging), because there's likely to be conflicts in `conftest.py` (in particular). Even if I branched the new PR off the previous one on the expectation that it would be merged, I'd have to keep adding merge commits into (or force-rebasing) the other branch to keep it up-to-date, which wouldn't be completely ideal in that it would make a bit of a mess in the git log. If you want to merge this one (after I've gone through and put some more comments in), I'm happy to start a new one. I can also start a new one on a new branch, I think it might just make a bit more of a mess than it solves. I think this one only got big because I had a good amount of free time at the same time as a `qutip` release happened, and most of the maintainers took a break for a few weeks. Right now I'm a bit busier with work so my conversion rate has slowed a little. I'll probably be back on it in a week or so.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241:1339,test,tests,1339,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241,2,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'tests']"
Testability,"ing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command line. You can do `pytest file.py` to run only those in a specific file, or `pytest -m ""mark logic""` (e.g. `pytest -m ""not slow""`) to hit specifically marked tests. Perhaps most powerfully, and one I use a lot when writing these, you can do `pytest -k ""substring logic""` to run every test (potentially in the specified file(s)) that contains the elements specified in `""substring logic""`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:2288,log,logical,2288,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'logical', 'test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"ipt, other than uninstalling cvxpy to make it run.; I then reinstalled cvxpy with upgrade and then qutip again. This time I can still import qutip, but with a warning. I ran the script with no problem, but still got the same deviated behavior from 3 years ago. [codes.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16367713/codes.zip). The 3-year-old script is included only to show the previous results. It is not meant to be run. I suspect if you run it with your likely different setup, you might get the same deviation as I did, or even yet another different deviation. I cannot recall the state of installation I had from 3 years ago. I believe I did it through conda. I just realized that I cannot include qutip scripts with this report. I included a zipped folder containing these two files. Please let me know if it didn'tgo through. Thank you! . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; Old code in ""Ikonen First Shot New Unitary Trans States 2 level Full H Gated Test 2 - Copy.ipynb""; New code in ""Test.ipynb""; Both attached.; These two codes are exactly identical. Only difference is in the qutip installation, one from 3 years ago and one just completed.; ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; Output in block 23 in the new code is significantly different from that in block 215 in the old code.; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. Expected qutip to produce same results on identical codes 3 years apart. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python; ================================; Copyright (c) QuTiP team 2011 and later.; Current admin team: Alexander Pitchford, Nathan Shammah, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Neill Lambert, Eric Giguère, Boxi Li, Jake Lishman, Simon Cross, Asier Galicia, Paul Menczel, and Patrick Hopf.; Board members: Daniel Burgarth, Robert Johansson, Anton F.

As far as I can tell this XIO error is related to the xvfb module (pytest-xvfb) used to manage graphical tests without display. Some relevant discussion is found at https://github.com/The-Compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues/11 . They indicate there that this error can be triggered if windows managed by Xvfb are not properly closed before completing tests. So it's likely it's related to tests using matplotlib. The only test using matplot lib is testPlot in test_processor.py. Sure enough, if testPlot is skipped then test_processor.py passes successfully without triggering the XIO error. **To Reproduce**.

Testability,"it of a larger restructure:; - rearrange the repo root to have `/src/qutip` and `/test/qutip` instead of `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---. About us breaking downstream CI: having been a maintainer of QuTiP and now Qiskit, I have a deep-rooted hatred for any upstream package that forces CI failures on its dependents, because it _requires_ the lower packages to move ""fix CI"" way up to the top of their priority list; you can't m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075:1076,test,tests,1076,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"latform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, with separated components; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using globbing; - version information is now stored in a single-line file `VERSION`. This is mostly for CI reasons; it's much easier to parse and override at the CI level when it's a single file, rather than attempting `sed s/.../.../ setup.py` or something crazy like that. The validity of the version string is tested by regex.; - local version information is now _always_ appended, even if `git` isn't present - the local version is just then ""nogit"" rather than the git shorthash; - `setup.py` gained a new `--release` flag or environment variable `CI_QUTIP_RELEASE`; the only effect right now is to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the code. ### Notes on the wheels. Currently I build only for CPython. I haven't tried to build pypy wheels, but we _may_ support it - Cython does in theory, but I think complex numbers and raw pointers aren't handled completely smoothly, and we make heavy use of both. We get `manylinux1` builds for Linux, which is the oldest `manylinux` spec. This can be updated in the future, but I'm not sure I see a need; all our heavy mathematical lifting is either done by custom code (which is mostly immune) or BLAS/LAPACK (which we link to dynamically), so I don't think there's much to be gained.

Testability,"ly by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. That's an extremely exciting prospect! I'd love to be able to have internal sparse data for Qobj's that represent Hamiltonians/Liouvillians, but dense data for Qobj's that represent Hilbert space states or Density matrices. In fact, it looks like a significant part of the overhead in the [calculation of the Krotov's pulse update](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/optimize.py#L466) is due to the stacking/unstacking, see [`profile.svg`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/raw/f3f49104083d59b9612f153d2f0ff652ea6a9f01/profile.svg) in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf#file-profile-svg). In the benchmarking notebook, for the optimization in `In [34]`, that's the extra 6 seconds per iteration (iterations 1-3 should ideally take exactly twice as long as iteration 0, as iteration 0 is a simple forward propagation and all later iterations are one forward and one backward propagations). That's what we have in our Fortran implementation, too: the runtime of the optimization is basically just the runtime of all the internal propagations; calculating the updates should be completely negligible. There's also [shape conversions](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L254-L260) happening in [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) which would be nice to eliminate. Lastly, having dense internal storage for states might actually give the same speedup as we've demonstrated in https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/09_example_numpy.html for doing Krotov with numpy arrays instead of Qobj's -- potentially even more speedup, in fact, since with nump",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:3870,benchmark,benchmarking,3870,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']
Testability,"ly their surrounding `Cython` code to ease maintainability and reduce code bloat of the repository. First, a couple of arguments against doing so:; - the versions in `scipy` and `qutip` did subsequently diverge in some form, because they no longer universally give the same results, possibly as a result of #654.; - the `qutip` version of `reverse_cuthill_mckee` is about 10% faster than the `scipy` version; - people may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],; [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]); ```; we get; ```; qutip: [9, 6, 7, 1, 4, 5",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:1322,test,tests,1322,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"matplotlib 3.4 has begun issuing some new deprecation warnings against some of the stuff we do in `bloch.py`.

Pass the keyword argument auto_add_to_figure=False and use fig.add_axes(ax) to suppress this warning. The default value of auto_add_to_figure will change to False in mpl3.5 and True values will no longer work in 3.6. This is consistent with other Axes classes.; self.axes = Axes3D(self.fig, azim=self.view[0], elev=self.view[1]). /Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/qutip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/qutip/bloch.py:59: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning:; The M attribute was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.4 and will be removed two minor releases later.

The warnings themselves suggest fixes, however some care needs to be taken; I suspect that the additional keyword `auto_add_to_figure` might be new in matplotlib 3.4 (not sure about the `.M` attribute). We want to keep compatibility with at least `matplotlib>=3` (we don't want to picky so it's easy to use QuTiP with other packages), so it might be necessary to include a version test using `packaging.version.parse`.

Testability,"may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],; [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]); ```; we get; ```; qutip: [9, 6, 7, 1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 3, 8]; matlab: [0, 8, 5, 7, 3, 6, 4, 2, 1, 9]; ```; (where I converted the `matlab` indexing into 0-based), however they both have the same ""bandwidth"" of 5, so I assume they are all equivalent. I don't really know anything about the theory here, and just went with what the `matlab` documentation said: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/symrcm.html.

As far as I can tell this XIO error is related to the xvfb module (pytest-xvfb) used to manage graphical tests without display. Some relevant discussion is found at https://github.com/The-Compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues/11 . They indicate there that this error can be triggered if windows managed by Xvfb are not properly closed before completing tests. So it's likely it's related to tests using matplotlib. The only test using matplot lib is testPlot in test_processor.py. Sure enough, if testPlot is skipped then test_processor.py passes successfully without triggering the XIO error. **To Reproduce**. Run test_processor.py directly:; ```; python3 -m pytest /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/qutip/tests/test_processor.py -v; ```.

Similarly elsewhere. * I wonder whether instead `QobjEvo`, `Qobjt` could be even more intuitive for the user. * I would really encourage you to write one notebook (or more), about the new functionalities of the stochastic solvers, as well as the old methods. This could be the to-go resource, beyond documentation, to understand how these stochastic solvers are now expanded and coherently defined. It does not need to be a lot of work, it can copy a lot of stuff from the development notebooks. It would be fundamental to have the solvers' master equations written down, explaining for each solver what each term is, e.g., the jump operator. Also, in `development-smesolve-tests`, the equations are already there for example. Block 23 is beautiful, and it could be reproduced in the tutorial. . * Similarly, a user guide entry would really enhance the adoption of these solvers. At a later stage, some more refined example applications could be provided. * Review is still ongoing, I will provide comments on the .py files and other solvers files.
