Performance,"mutation of the string. Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow. As such, it is better to use; SmallVector or Twine as a scratch buffer, but then use std::string to persist; the result. .. _ds_set:. Set-Like Containers (std::set, SmallSet, SetVector, etc); --------------------------------------------------------.

The GL Viewer uses <OpenGL®> (or compliant libraries such as <Mesa3D>); to generate high quality, high-performance 3D renderings, with; sophisticated lighting, materials and rendering styles for 3D scenes.; Many users will be able to take advantage of hardware acceleration of; the underlying OpenGL commands by their computer's video card, resulting; is considerable performance gains - up to interactive manipulation of; 1000's of complex shapes in real-time. The GL Viewer is supported on all official ROOT platforms (assuming you; have suitable <OpenGL®> libraries), and is the main 3D viewer, which; development effort is concentrated upon.

You can manipulate the viewer via the GUI or via the base; **`TGLViewer`** object behind the interface.

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]].

If different cleanup code needs to get executed for different suspend points,; a similar switch will be in the `f.destroy` function. .. note ::. Using suspend index in a coroutine state and having a switch in `f.resume` and; `f.destroy` is one of the possible implementation strategies. We explored; another option where a distinct `f.resume1`, `f.resume2`, etc. are created for; every suspend point, and instead of storing an index, the resume and destroy; function pointers are updated at every suspend. Early testing showed that the; current approach is easier on the optimizer than the latter so it is a; lowering strategy implemented at the moment. Distinct Save and Suspend; -------------------------. In the previous example, setting a resume index (or some other state change that; needs to happen to prepare a coroutine for resumption) happens at the same time as; a suspension of a coroutine. However, in certain cases, it is necessary to control; when coroutine is prepared for resumption and when it is suspended. In the following example, a coroutine represents some activity that is driven; by completions of asynchronous operations `async_op1` and `async_op2` which get; a coroutine handle as a parameter and resume the coroutine once async; operation is finished. .. code-block:: text. void g() {; for (;;); if (cond()) {; async_op1(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op1 completes; <suspend>; do_one();; }; else {; async_op2(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op2 completes; <suspend>; do_two();; }; }; }.

Performance,"n bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------. You can compute an address that way, but if you use GEP to do the add, you can't; use that pointer to actually access the object, unless the object is managed; outside of LLVM. The underlying integer computation is sufficiently defined; null has a defined; value --- zero --- and you can add whatever value you want to it. However, it's invalid to access (load from or store to) an LLVM-aware object; with such a pointer. This includes ``GlobalVariables``, ``Allocas``, and objects; pointed to by noalias pointers. If you really need this functionality, you can do the arithmetic with explicit; integer instructions, and use inttoptr to convert the result to an address. Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences.

LLVM Optimization Passes; ========================. LLVM provides many optimization passes, which do many different sorts of; things and have different tradeoffs. Unlike other systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in.

The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions.

Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation. As an exception to the preceding rule, the compiler may not assume execution; will continue after a volatile store operation. This restriction is necessary; to support the somewhat common pattern in C of intentionally storing to an; invalid pointer to crash the program. In the future, it might make sense to; allow frontends to control this behavior. IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into llvm.memcpy; or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are flagged volatile.; Likewise, the backend should never split or merge target-legal volatile; load/store instructions. Similarly, IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot; change from integer to floating-point or vice versa. .. admonition:: Rationale. Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported; data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C; this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native; hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types.

Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store.

Performance,"n performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape. Choosing a normal container is therefore; recommended whenever possible. \image html geometry006.png ""Assemblies of volumes"" width=600px. \anchor GP01c; ### Geometrical Transformations. All geometrical transformations handled by the modeller are provided as; a built-in package. This was designed to minimize memory requirements; and optimize performance of point/vector master-to-local and; local-to-master computation. We need to have in mind that a; transformation in **`TGeo`** has two major use-cases. The first one is; for defining the placement of a volume with respect to its container; reference frame. This frame will be called 'master' and the frame of the; positioned volume - 'local'. If `T` is a transformation used for; positioning volume daughters, then: `MASTER = T * LOCAL`. Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class. A general homogenous transformation is defined as a 4x4 matrix embedding; a rotation, a translation and a scale. The advantage of this description; is that each basic transformation can be represented as a homogenous; matrix, composition being performed as simple matrix multiplication. Rotation:. \f[; \left|\begin{array}{cccc}; r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & 0 \\; r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & 0 \\; r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & 0 \\; 0 & 0 & 0 & 1; \end{array}; \right|; \f].

Performance,"n prior to this effort and serves as the; baseline for performance. One attempt to address the performance overhead of this and make it more; realistic to deploy is [MSVC's /Qspectre; switch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/).; Their technique is to use static analysis within the compiler to only insert; `lfence` instructions into conditional edges at risk of attack. However,; [initial](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/microsofts-compiler-level-spectre-fix-shows-how-hard-this-problem-will-be-to-solve/); [analysis](https://www.paulkocher.com/doc/MicrosoftCompilerSpectreMitigation.html); has shown that this approach is incomplete and only catches a small and limited; subset of attackable patterns which happen to resemble very closely the initial; proofs of concept. As such, while its performance is acceptable, it does not; appear to be an adequate systematic mitigation. ## Performance Overhead. The performance overhead of this style of comprehensive mitigation is very; high. However, it compares very favorably with previously recommended; approaches such as the `lfence` instruction. Just as users can restrict the; scope of `lfence` to control its performance impact, this mitigation technique; could be restricted in scope as well. However, it is important to understand what it would cost to get a fully; mitigated baseline. Here we assume targeting a Haswell (or newer) processor and; using all of the tricks to improve performance (so leaves the low 2gb; unprotected and +/- 2gb surrounding any PC in the program). We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers.

The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheata@cern.ch>. ## Database Libraries. * Fix `TPgSQLStatement::SetBinary` to actually handle binary data (previous limited to ascii). ## Networking Libraries. * When seeing too many requested range",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23703,load,loading,23703,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['load'],['loading']

Let us look how the; ***`rootgeom`*** example looks clipped with a tube. ![Ray-tracing example with box-clipping](pictures/030001E5.png). ## Representing Misalignments of the Ideal Geometry. The ideal positioning of a detector does not match its position in the; experimental hall. This generally happens not only for the detector; modules, but also for their components. The accurate knowledge of the; detector real misalignments can be extremely important for getting close; to its designed resolution and the expected tracking efficiency.; **`TGeo`** offers tools for representing positioning misalignments,; applying them to the ideal geometry and performing navigation under; these conditions. Detector tracking algorithms can then directly query; the geometry for navigation purposes or for retrieving actual; misalignment information. ### Physical Nodes. Physical nodes are the actual ""touchable"" objects in the geometry,; representing actually a path of positioned volumes starting with the; top node: `path=/TOP/A_1/B_4/C_3` , where `A`, `B`, `C` represent names; of volumes. The number of physical nodes is given by the total number of; possible of branches in the geometry hierarchy. In case of detector; geometries and specially for calorimeters this number can be of the; order 106-109, therefore it is impossible to create all physical nodes; as objects in memory. In **`TGeo`**, physical nodes are represented by; the class **`TGeoPhysicalNode`** and can be created on demand for; alignment purposes:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoPhysicalNode(const char* path); ```.

This works as long as __cfi_check is aligned by 4096 bytes and located; below any call targets in its DSO, but not more than 256MB apart from; them. CFI_SlowPath; ------------.

These functions loads a shadow value for ``TargetAddr``, finds the; address of ``__cfi_check`` as described above and calls; that. ``DiagData`` is an opaque pointer to diagnostic data which is; passed verbatim to ``__cfi_check``, and ``__cfi_slowpath`` passes; ``nullptr`` instead.

Add noalias/align/dereferenceable/nonnull to function arguments and return; values as appropriate. #. Use pointer aliasing metadata, especially tbaa metadata, to communicate; otherwise-non-deducible pointer aliasing facts. #. Use inbounds on geps. This can help to disambiguate some aliasing queries. Undefined Values; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use poison values instead of undef values whenever possible. #. Tag function parameters with the noundef attribute whenever possible. Modeling Memory Effects; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Mark functions as readnone/readonly/argmemonly or noreturn/nounwind when; known.

With a copying garbage collector, derived pointers must not be retained across; collector safe points; the collector could move the objects and invalidate the; derived pointer. This is bad enough in the first place, but safe points can; crop up unpredictably. Consider:. %array = load { i32, [0 x %obj] }** %array_addr; %nth_el = getelementptr { i32, [0 x %obj] }* %array, i32 0, i32 %n; %old = load %obj** %nth_el; %z = div i64 %x, %y; store %obj* %new, %obj** %nth_el. If the i64 division is lowered to a libcall, then a safe point will (must); appear for the call site. If a collection occurs, %array and %nth_el no longer; point into the correct object. The fix for this is to copy address calculations so that dependent pointers; are never live across safe point boundaries.

Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and; fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call; to fit the histogram, the ""fitter"" will dynamically load libMinuit if; it is not yet loaded. #### Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking. plugin manager The Plugin Manager **`TPluginManager`** allows; postponing library dependencies to runtime: a plugin library will only; be loaded when it is needed.

Performance,"n. For example, knowing that a; branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better decisions when; ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation. Regardless of which kind of profiling you use, be careful to collect profiles; by running your code with inputs that are representative of the typical; behavior. Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling. Differences Between Sampling and Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although both techniques are used for similar purposes, there are important; differences between the two:. 1. Profile data generated with one cannot be used by the other, and there is no; conversion tool that can convert one to the other. So, a profile generated; via ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` must be used with; ``-fprofile-use`` or ``-fprofile-instr-use``. Similarly, sampling profiles; generated by external profilers must be converted and used with ``-fprofile-sample-use``; or ``-fauto-profile``. 2. Instrumentation profile data can be used for code coverage analysis and; optimization. 3. Sampling profiles can only be used for optimization. They cannot be used for; code coverage analysis. Although it would be technically possible to use; sampling profiles for cod",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:90615,optimiz,optimized,90615,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimized']"
Performance,"n. To represent this, a top level landing pad may exist to; filter out invalid types. To express this in LLVM code the :ref:`i_landingpad`; will have a filter clause. The clause consists of an array of type infos.; ``landingpad`` will return a negative value; if the exception does not match any of the type infos. If no match is found then; a call to ``__cxa_call_unexpected`` should be made, otherwise; ``_Unwind_Resume``. Each of these functions requires a reference to the; exception structure. Note that the most general form of a ``landingpad``; instruction can have any number of catch, cleanup, and filter clauses (though; having more than one cleanup is pointless). The LLVM C++ front-end can generate; such ``landingpad`` instructions due to inlining creating nested exception; handling scopes. Restrictions; ------------. The unwinder delegates the decision of whether to stop in a call frame to that; call frame's language-specific personality function. Not all unwinders guarantee; that they will stop to perform cleanups. For example, the GNU C++ unwinder; doesn't do so unless the exception is actually caught somewhere further up the; stack. In order for inlining to behave correctly, landing pads must be prepared to; handle selector results that they did not originally advertise. Suppose that a; function catches exceptions of type ``A``, and it's inlined into a function that; catches exceptions of type ``B``. The inliner will update the ``landingpad``; instruction for the inlined landing pad to include the fact that ``B`` is also; caught. If that landing pad assumes that it will only be entered to catch an; ``A``, it's in for a rude awakening. Consequently, landing pads must test for; the selector results they understand and then resume exception propagation with; the `resume instruction <LangRef.html#i_resume>`_ if none of the conditions; match.

As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand.

The interpreter is activated using the following flags:. * ``-fexperimental-new-constant-interpreter`` enables the interpreter,; emitting an error if an unsupported feature is encountered. Bytecode Compilation; ====================. Bytecode compilation is handled in ``ByteCodeStmtGen.h`` for statements; and ``ByteCodeExprGen.h`` for expressions. The compiler has two different; backends: one to generate bytecode for functions (``ByteCodeEmitter``) and; one to directly evaluate expressions as they are compiled, without; generating bytecode (``EvalEmitter``). All functions are compiled to; bytecode, while toplevel expressions used in constant contexts are directly; evaluated since the bytecode would never be reused. This mechanism aims to; pave the way towards replacing the evaluator, improving its performance on; functions and loops, while being just as fast on single-use toplevel; expressions. The interpreter relies on stack-based, strongly-typed opcodes. The glue; logic between the code generator, along with the enumeration and; description of opcodes, can be found in ``Opcodes.td``. The opcodes are; implemented as generic template methods in ``Interp.h`` and instantiated; with the relevant primitive types by the interpreter loop or by the; evaluating emitter. Primitive Types; ---------------. * ``PT_{U|S}int{8|16|32|64}``. Signed or unsigned integers of a specific bit width, implemented using; the ```Integral``` type. * ``PT_{U|S}intFP``.

The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives.

Performance,"nable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly. It; does this by coalescing contiguous ranges of set bits into intervals. Searching; for a bit in a CoalescingBitVector is O(log(gaps between contiguous ranges)). CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large. It's a better choice than SparseBitVector when find(); operations must have fast, predictable performance. However, it's not a good; choice for representing sets which have lots of very short ranges. E.g. the set; `{2*x : x \in [0, n)}` would be a pathological input. .. _utility_functions:. Useful Utility Functions; ========================. LLVM implements a number of general utility functions used across the; codebase. You can find the most common ones in ``STLExtras.h``; (`doxygen <https://llvm.org/doxygen/STLExtras_8h.html>`__). Some of these wrap; well-known C++ standard library functions, while others are unique to LLVM. .. _uf_iteration:.

The name must not include a comma (,) as that is used to separate the; arguments of the ``-debug-only`` option. For performance reasons, -debug-only is not available in optimized build; (``--enable-optimized``) of LLVM. The ``DEBUG_WITH_TYPE`` macro is also available for situations where you would; like to set ``DEBUG_TYPE``, but only for one specific ``DEBUG`` statement. It; takes an additional first parameter, which is the type to use. For example, the; preceding example could be written as:. .. code-block:: c++. DEBUG_WITH_TYPE(""foo"", dbgs() << ""'foo' debug type\n"");; DEBUG_WITH_TYPE(""bar"", dbgs() << ""'bar' debug type\n"");. .. _Statistic:. The ``Statistic`` class & ``-stats`` option; -------------------------------------------. The ``llvm/ADT/Statistic.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Statistic_8h_source.html>`__) file provides a class; named ``Statistic`` that is used as a unified way to keep track of what the LLVM; compiler is doing and how effective various optimizations are. It is useful to; see what optimizations are contributing to making a particular program run; faster. Often you may run your pass on some big program, and you're interested to see; how many times it makes a certain transformation. Although you can do this with; hand inspection, or some ad-hoc method, this is a real pain and not very useful; for big programs. Using the ``Statistic`` class makes it very easy to keep; track of this information, and the calculated information is presented in a; uniform manner with the rest of the passes being executed. There are many examples of ``Statistic`` uses, but the basics of using it are as; follows:. Define your statistic like this:. .. code-block:: c++. #define DEBUG_TYPE ""mypassname"" // This goes after any #includes.; STATISTIC(NumXForms, ""The # of times I did stuff"");.

Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment. That way, the position of the; store and marker can be considered together when making that choice. Another; important benefit of referring to the store is that we can then build a two-way; mapping of stores<->markers that can be used to find markers that need to be; updated when stores are modified. An `llvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```. The first three parameters look and behave like an `llvm.dbg.value`. `ID` is a; reference to a store (see next section). `Address` is the destination address; of the store and it is modified by `AddressExpression`. An empty/undef/poison; address means the address component has been killed (the memory address is no; longer a valid location). LLVM currently encodes variable fragment information; in `DIExpression`s, so as an implementation quirk the `FragmentInfo` for; `Variable` is contained within `ValueExpression` only.

These restrictions; are described as the semantics of an ""unknown"" operand bundle. As; long as the behavior of an operand bundle is describable within these; restrictions, LLVM does not need to have special knowledge of the; operand bundle to not miscompile programs containing it. - The bundle operands for an unknown operand bundle escape in unknown; ways before control is transferred to the callee or invokee.; - Calls and invokes with operand bundles have unknown read / write; effect on the heap on entry and exit (even if the call target specifies; a ``memory`` attribute), unless they're overridden with; callsite specific attributes.; - An operand bundle at a call site cannot change the implementation; of the called function.

There can be at most one ``""deopt""`` operand; bundle attached to a call site. Exact details of deoptimization is; out of scope for the language reference, but it usually involves; rewriting a compiled frame into a set of interpreted frames.

Vector Builtins; ---------------. **Note: The implementation of vector builtins is work-in-progress and incomplete.**. In addition to the operators mentioned above, Clang provides a set of builtins; to perform additional operations on certain scalar and vector types. Let ``T`` be one of the following types:. * an integer type (as in C23 6.2.5p22), but excluding enumerated types and ``bool``; * the standard floating types float or double; * a half-precision floating point type, if one is supported on the target; * a vector type. For scalar types, consider the operation applied to a vector with a single element. *Vector Size*; To determine the number of elements in a vector, use ``__builtin_vectorelements()``.; For fixed-sized vectors, e.g., defined via ``__attribute__((vector_size(N)))`` or ARM; NEON's vector types (e.g., ``uint16x8_t``), this returns the constant number of; elements at compile-time. For scalable vectors, e.g., SVE or RISC-V V, the number of; elements is not known at compile-time and is determined at runtime. This builtin can; be used, e.g., to increment the loop-counter in vector-type agnostic loops. *Elementwise Builtins*.

Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###.

The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up and binding; the method before the loop, and discarding it afterwards. Here is an; example:. ``` {.cpp}; hpx = TH1F('hpx','px',100,-4,4); hpxFill = hpx.Fill # cache bound method; for i in xrange(25000):; px = gRandom.Gaus(); hpxFill(px) # use bound method: no lookup needed; del hpxFill # done with cached method; ```.

Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data.

The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

Using the upper xmm registers (xmm8-xmm15) forces a longer instruction encoding; which may put greater pressure on the frontend fetch and decode stages,; potentially reducing the rate that instructions are dispatched to the backend,; particularly on older hardware. Comparing baseline results with this mode; enabled can help determine the effects of the frontend and can be used to; improve latency and throughput estimates. .. option:: --repetition-mode=[duplicate|loop|min]. Specify the repetition mode. `duplicate` will create a large, straight line; basic block with `num-repetitions` instructions (repeating the snippet; `num-repetitions`/`snippet size` times). `loop` will, optionally, duplicate the; snippet until the loop body contains at least `loop-body-size` instructions,; and then wrap the result in a loop which will execute `num-repetitions`; instructions (thus, again, repeating the snippet; `num-repetitions`/`snippet size` times). The `loop` mode, especially with loop; unrolling tends to better hide the effects of the CPU frontend on architectures; that cache decoded instructions, but consumes a register for counting; iterations. If performing an analysis over many opcodes, it may be best to; instead use the `min` mode, which will run each other mode,; and produce the minimal measured result. .. option:: --num-repetiti",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:12234,latency,latency,12234,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,2,"['latency', 'throughput']","['latency', 'throughput']"

Performance,"nce. We introduced an optimized infrastructure for reading objects using a StreamerInfo. Rather than driving the streaming using a switch statement inside TStreamerInfo::ReadBuffer,; the streaming is now driven using a simple loop over a sequence of configured StreamerInfo actions. This improves run-time performance by allowing a dramatic reduction in function calls and code; branches at the expense of some code duplication. There are 3 versions of this loop implemented in TBufferFile and overloaded in TBufferXML and TBufferSQL:. virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence, void *object);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);. The 1st version is optimized to read a single object. The 2nd version is optimized to read the content of TClonesArrays and vectors of pointers to objects. The 3rd version is used to streamed any collections. TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.). A TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence is an ordered sequence of configured actions. A configured action has both an action which is a free standing function and a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TConfiguration. The configuration contains information that is specific to the action; but varies from use to use, including the offset from the beginning of the object that needs to be updated.; Other examples of configuration include the number of bits requested for storing a Double32_t or its factor and minimum. When the sequence is intended for a collection, the sequence has a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TLoopConfiguration which contains for",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html:3802,optimiz,optimized,3802,io/doc/v528/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"nces C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:5569,optimiz,optimizations,5569,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

This is because dagcombine2 needs to be able to see; through the X86ISD::Wrapper node, which DAGCombine can't really do.; 2.

A delta between Dispatch Width and the theoretical maximum uOps per; Cycle (computed by dividing the number of uOps of a single iteration by the; `Block RThroughput`) is an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the; lack of hardware resources.; In general, the lower the Block RThroughput, the better. In this example, ``uOps per iteration/Block RThroughput`` is 1.50. Since there; are no loop-carried dependencies, the observed `uOps Per Cycle` is expected to; approach 1.50 when the number of iterations tends to infinity. The delta between; the Dispatch Width (2.00), and the theoretical maximum uOp throughput (1.50) is; an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the lack of hardware; resources, and the *Resource pressure view* can help to identify the problematic; resource usage. The second section of the report is the `instruction info view`. It shows the; latency and reciprocal throughput of every instruction in the sequence.

In particular, the new interfaces are type-safe through the use of; templates, and the ownership is well-defined through the use of smart pointers. For instance. tree->Branch(""px"", &Category, ""px/F"");. becomes. auto px = model->MakeField<float>(""px"");; // px is std::shared_ptr<float>. The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:1020,optimiz,optimized,1020,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

One can find fast if a point different from the current one has or not; the same location inside the geometry tree. To do that, the new point; should not be introduced by using `TGeoManager::SetCurrentPoint()`; method, but rather by calling the specific method:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(Double_t x,Double_t y,; Double_t z,Bool_t change=kFALSE);; ```. In the prototype above, `x, y` and `z` are the coordinates of the new; point. The modeller will check whether the current volume still contains; the new point or its location has changed in the geometry hierarchy. If; the new location is different, two actions are possible according to the; value of `change`:. - `change = kFALSE` (default) - the modeller does not change the; current state but just inform the caller about this change.; - `change = kTRUE` - the modeller will actually perform a new; `‘Where am I?' `search after finding out that the location has; changed. The current state will be actualized accordingly. Note that even when performing a normal search on the current state; after changing the current point coordinates (e.g.; `gGeoManager->FindNode(newX,newY,newZ)`), users can always query if the; previous state has changed by using a method having the same name but; without parameters:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoManager::IsSameLocation();; ```. #### Finding the Distance to the Next Boundary. All tracking engines need to compare the currently proposed physical; step with the maximum allowed distance in the current material. The; modeller provides this information by computing the distance to the; first boundary starting from the current point along a straight line.; The starting point and direction for this procedure are the ones; corresponding to the current state.

To aleviate the pain for Windows users who want to try ROOT 6 we provide; a recipe on how to run ROOT 6 in a VM on Windows. Building ROOT also requires a C++11 compatible compiler, so one needs to either have installed gcc >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.4.

This; is not intended to be a precise guide to the semantics; the details can get; extremely complicated and unreadable, and are not usually necessary. .. _Optimization outside atomic:. Optimization outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line.

That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part; of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory; operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly; equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a; Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release; store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a; Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some; complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details. Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the; target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and; therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be; impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:.

Performance,"nderlying data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again (called a ""round trip""), the memory contents should be the same after the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y. This would produce a code sequence such as that in the figure on the right. The mismatched ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` cause the stored data to differ from the loaded data. .. container:: clearer. When we see a bitcast from type ``X`` to type ``Y``, what we need to do is to change the in-register representation of the data to be *as if* it had just been loaded by a ``LD1`` of type ``Y``. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastsuccess.png; :align: right. Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to change the representation to be as if it had been loaded by an ``LD1`` of type ``Y``. For the previous example, this would be::. LD1 v0.4s, [x]. REV64 v0.4s, v0.4s // There is no REV128 instruction, so it must be synthesizedcd; EXT v0.16b, v0.16b, v0.16b, #8 // with a REV64 then an EXT to swap the two 64-bit elements. REV64 v0.2d, v0.2d; EXT v0.16b, v0.16b, v0.16b, #8. ST1 v0.2d, [y]. It turns out that these ``REV`` pairs can, in almost all cases, be squashed together into a single ``REV``. For the example above, a ``REV128 4s`` + ``REV128 2d`` is actually a ``REV64 4s``, as shown in the figure on the right. .. [1] One lane vectors may seem useless as a concept but they serve to distinguish between values held in general purpose registers and values held in NEON/VFP registers. For example, an ``i64`` would live in an ``x`` register, but ``<1 x i64>`` would live in a ``d`` register.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:11084,load,loaded,11084,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,2,['load'],['loaded']

Added mechanisms to stop the dictionary generation while parsing the XML and while selecting in presence of duplicates. Fix [ROOT-7760] : fully allow the usage of the dylib extension on OSx. Fix [ROOT-7723] : allow IOCtors to have as argument a ref to a type called __void__. We added a dictionary for map<string,string> as part of the default STL dictionary. We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ### Thread safety and thread awareness. We added the function `TMethodCall::GetCallFunc` to allow direct access to the function wrapper. We reduced thread serialization in `TClass::GetCheckSum`, `TClass::GetBaseClassOffset` and `TClass::Property`. `TObjArray::Delete` was updated to allow its caller to explicitly avoid costly checks (extra RecursiveRemove and lock). We removed the need to create a TThread object per thread in a multi-threaded application. Now ROOT can be used with any threading model (e.g. OpenMP, STL threads, TBB) transparently. All the internal synchronisation mechanisms of ROOT are activated by a single call: `ROOT::EnableThreadSafety()` which is the successor of the existing `TThread::Initialize`. This call must take place if ROOT needs to be used in a thread safe manner. The implementation of TSemaphore was redone based on C++11 thread primitive in order to prevent cases where some of request post were lost. ### TDirectory::TContext.

Performance,"nding dead code behind A/B experiment flags. Finding dead code is a classic application of data flow analysis. Unused flags for A/B experiment hide dead code. However, this flavor of dead; code is invisible to the compiler because the flag can be turned on at any; moment. We could make a tool that deletes experiment flags. The user tells us which flag; they want to delete, and we assume that the it's value is a given constant. For example, the user could use the tool to remove `example_flag` from this; code:. ```c++; DEFINE_FLAG(std::string, example_flag, """", ""A sample flag."");. void Example() {; bool x = GetFlag(FLAGS_example_flag).empty();; f();; if (x) {; g();; } else {; h();; }; }; ```. The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors.

Performance,"ndler Carruth - [chandlerc@google.com](mailto:chandlerc@google.com). ## Problem Statement. Recently, Google Project Zero and other researchers have found information leak; vulnerabilities by exploiting speculative execution in modern CPUs. These; exploits are currently broken down into three variants:; * GPZ Variant #1 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #1): Bounds check (or predicate) bypass; * GPZ Variant #2 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #2): Branch target injection; * GPZ Variant #3 (a.k.a. Meltdown): Rogue data cache load. For more details, see the Google Project Zero blog post and the Spectre research; paper:; * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html; * https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf. The core problem of GPZ Variant #1 is that speculative execution uses branch; prediction to select the path of instructions speculatively executed. This path; is speculatively executed with the available data, and may load from memory and; leak the loaded values through various side channels that survive even when the; speculative execution is unwound due to being incorrect. Mispredicted paths can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data. Here is an example,; extracted and simplified from the Project Zero paper:; ```; struct array {; unsigned long length;; unsigned char data[];; };; struct array *arr1 = ...; // small array; struct array *arr2 = ...; // array of size 0x400; unsigned long untrusted_offset_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_offset_from_caller < arr1->length) {; unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset_from_caller];; unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200;; unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];; }; ```.

Performance,"nds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count. Using this information, ``ConstraintElimination`` is able; to determine ``p + count`` doesn’t wrap.; * Accordingly, ``p + i`` and ``p + i + 1`` also don’t wrap.; * Therefore, ``p <= p + i`` and ``p + i + 1 <= p + count``.; * The if-condition simplifies to false and becomes dead code that the subsequent; optimization passes can remove. ``OptRemarks`` can be utilized to provide insights into performance tuning. It; has the capability to report on checks that it cannot eliminate, possibly with; reasons, allowing programmers to adjust their code to unlock further; optimizations. Debugging; =========. Internal bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Internal bounds annotations change a pointer into a wide pointer. The debugger; needs to understand that wide pointers are essentially pointers with a struct; layout. To handle this, a wide pointer is described as a record type in the; debug info. The type name has a special name prefix (e.g.,; ``__bounds_safety$bidi_indexable``) which can be recognized by a debug info; consumer to provide support that goes beyond showing the internal structure of; the wide pointer. There are no DWARF extensions needed to support wide pointers.; In our implementation, LLDB recognizes wide pointer types by name and; reconstruct",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst:7923,optimiz,optimization,7923,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"nds on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime. There are also uncommon enough to make it; reasonable to require the precise-lifetime annotation if someone; really wants to rely on them.

In the prototype above, `x, y` and `z` are the coordinates of the new; point. The modeller will check whether the current volume still contains; the new point or its location has changed in the geometry hierarchy. If; the new location is different, two actions are possible according to the; value of `change`:. - `change = kFALSE` (default) - the modeller does not change the; current state but just inform the caller about this change.; - `change = kTRUE` - the modeller will actually perform a new; `‘Where am I?' `search after finding out that the location has; changed. The current state will be actualized accordingly. Note that even when performing a normal search on the current state; after changing the current point coordinates (e.g.; `gGeoManager->FindNode(newX,newY,newZ)`), users can always query if the; previous state has changed by using a method having the same name but; without parameters:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoManager::IsSameLocation();; ```. #### Finding the Distance to the Next Boundary.

We don't change it too often,; but there are no specific promises. * Additions and changes to the IR should be reflected in; ``test/Bitcode/compatibility.ll``. * The current LLVM version supports loading any bitcode since version 3.0. * After each X.Y release, ``compatibility.ll`` must be copied to; ``compatibility-X.Y.ll``. The corresponding bitcode file should be assembled; using the X.Y build and committed as ``compatibility-X.Y.ll.bc``. * Newer releases can ignore features from older releases, but they cannot; miscompile them. For example, if nsw is ever replaced with something else,; dropping it would be a valid way to upgrade the IR. * Debug metadata is special in that it is currently dropped during upgrades. * Non-debug metadata is defined to be safe to drop, so a valid way to upgrade; it is to drop it. That is not very user friendly and a bit more effort is; expected, but no promises are made.

The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as; MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also; causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by; ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent); and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache; invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

There are different methods used for initializing flat scratch:. * If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`; specifies *Does not support generic address space*:. Flat scratch is not supported and there is no flat scratch register pair. * If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`; specifies *Offset flat scratch*:. If the kernel or any function it calls may use flat operations to access; scratch memory, the prolog code must set up the FLAT_SCRATCH register pair; (FLAT_SCRATCH_LO/FLAT_SCRATCH_HI). Initialization uses Flat Scratch Init and; Scratch Wavefront Offset SGPR registers (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`):. 1. The low word of Flat Scratch Init is the 32-bit byte offset from; ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to the base of scratch backing memory; being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. This is; the same value used in the Scratch Segment Buffer V# base address. CP obtains this from the runtime. (The Scratch Segment Buffer base address; is ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` plus this offset.). The prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset to get the; wavefront's byte scratch backing memory offset from; ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``. The Scratch Wavefront Offset must also be used as an offset with Private; segment address when using the Scratch Segment Buffer. Since FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is in units of 256 bytes, the offset must be right; shifted by 8 before moving into FLAT_SCRATCH_HI. FLAT_SCRATCH_HI corresponds to SGPRn-4 on GFX7, and SGPRn-6 on GFX8 (where; SGPRn is the highest numbered SGPR allocated to the wavefront).; FLAT_SCRATCH_HI is multiplied by 256 (as it is in units of 256 bytes) and; added to ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to calculate the per w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst:194658,queue,queue,194658,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,1,['queue'],['queue']

Performance,"nfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```.

Performance,"nformation collected during the linker's normal symbol resolution phase.; In the above example, the optimizer can not remove ``foo2()`` without the; linker's input because it is externally visible. This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer. Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself.

Performance,"ng IR to the JIT and making it available for execution. In; this initial implementation of our JIT we will make our modules ""available for; execution"" by adding them to the CompileLayer, which will it turn store the; Module in the main JITDylib. This process will create new symbol table entries; in the JITDylib for each definition in the module, and will defer compilation of; the module until any of its definitions is looked up. Note that this is not lazy; compilation: just referencing a definition, even if it is never used, will be; enough to trigger compilation. In later chapters we will teach our JIT to defer; compilation of functions until they're actually called. To add our Module we; must first wrap it in a ThreadSafeModule instance, which manages the lifetime of; the Module's LLVMContext (our Ctx member) in a thread-friendly way. In our; example, all modules will share the Ctx member, which will exist for the; duration of the JIT. Once we switch to concurrent compilation in later chapters; we will use a new context per module. Our last method is ``lookup``, which allows us to look up addresses for; function and variable definitions added to the JIT based on their symbol names.; As noted above, lookup will implicitly trigger compilation for any symbol; that has not already been compiled. Our lookup method calls through to; `ExecutionSession::lookup`, passing in a list of dylibs to search (in our case; just the main dylib), and the symbol name to search for, with a twist: We have; to *mangle* the name of the symbol we're searching for first. The ORC JIT; components use mangled symbols internally the same way a static compiler and; linker would, rather than using plain IR symbol names. This allows JIT'd code; to interoperate easily with precompiled code in the application or shared; libraries. The kind of mangling will depend on the DataLayout, which in turn; depends on the target platform.

Performance,"ng `Alias`, it is now possible to register homonymous aliases (alternative column names) in different branches of the computation graph, in line with the behavior of `Define` (until now, aliases were required to be unique in the whole computaton graph).; - The `Histo*D` methods now support the combination of scalar values and vector-like weight values. For each entry, the histogram is filled once for each weight, always with the same scalar value.; - The `Histo*D` methods do not work on columns of type `std::string` anymore. They used to fill the histogram with the integer value corresponding to each of the characters in the string. Please use `Fill` with a custom class to recover the old behavior if that was what was desired. ### Other improvements. - The scaling to a large amount of threads of computation graphs with many simple `Filter`s or `Define`s has been greatly improved, see also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036730/#1-a-performance-study-of-the-r) for more details; - The output format of `Display` has been significantly improved.; - The `Fill` method now correctly supports user-defined classes with arbitrary `Fill` signatures (see [#9428](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9428)). ### Experimental Distributed RDataFrame. The distributed RDataFrame module has been improved. Now it supports sending RDataFrame tasks to a [Dask](https://dask.org/) scheduler. Through Dask, RDataFrame can be also scaled to a cluster of machines managed through a batch system like HTCondor or Slurm. Here is an example:. ```python; import ROOT; from dask.distributed import Client; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Dask.RDataFrame. # In a Python script the Dask client needs to be initalized in a context; # Jupyter notebooks / Python session don't need this; if __name__ == ""__main__"":; client = Client(""SCHEDULER_ADDRESS""); df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root"", daskclient=client); # Proceed as usual; df.Define(""x"",""someoperation"").Histo1D(""x""); ```.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:9967,perform,performance-study-of-the-r,9967,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['perform'],['performance-study-of-the-r']

Access to Python objects from Cling is not completely fleshed out.; Currently, ROOT objects and built-in types can cross the boundary; between the two interpreters, but other objects are much more; restricted. For example, for a Python object to cross, it has to be a; class instance, and its class has to be known to Cling first (i.e. the; class has to cross first, before the instance can). All other; cross-coding is based on strings that are run on the Python interpreter; and vise-versa. With the ROOT v4.00/06 and later, the **`TPython`** class will be loaded; automatically on use, for older editions, the `libPyROOT.so` needs to be; loaded first before use. It is possible to switch between interpreters; by calling **`TPython::Prompt()`** on the ROOT side, while returning with; `^D` (`EOF`). State is preserved between successive switches, and string; based cross calls can nest as long as shared resources are properly; handled. ``` {.cpp}; // Example: accessing the Python interpreter from ROOT; // either load PyROOT explicitly or rely on auto-loading; root[] gSystem->Load( ""libPyROOT"" );; root[] TPython::Exec(""print1+1"");; 2. // create a TBrowser on the Python side, and transfer it back and forth; root[] TBrowser* b = (void*)TPython::Eval(""ROOT.TBrowser()"");; (class TObject*)0x8d1daa0; root[] TPython::Bind(b,""b"");. // builtin variables can cross-over (after the call i==2); root[] int i = TPython::Eval( ""1+1"" );; root[] i; (int)2; ```. ### Installation.

Can I do GEP with a different pointer type than the type of the underlying object?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes. There are no restrictions on bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object.

The underlying integer computation is sufficiently defined; null has a defined; value --- zero --- and you can add whatever value you want to it.

VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation.

The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape.

Performance,"ng the original; source from generated code. .. _intro_debugopt:. Debug information and optimizations; -----------------------------------. An extremely high priority of LLVM debugging information is to make it interact; well with optimizations and analysis. In particular, the LLVM debug; information provides the following guarantees:. * LLVM debug information **always provides information to accurately read; the source-level state of the program**, regardless of which LLVM; optimizations have been run. :doc:`HowToUpdateDebugInfo` specifies how debug; info should be updated in various kinds of code transformations to avoid; breaking this guarantee, and how to preserve as much useful debug info as; possible. Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:4461,optimiz,optimizations,4461,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimizations', 'perform']"
Performance,"ng this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data.

This is; the default when the input is a header file. * **IR generation**: This converts the source-level intermediate representation; into an optimizer-specific intermediate representation (IR); for Clang, this; is LLVM IR.; The ``-emit-llvm`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. If combined; with ``-S``, Clang will produce textual LLVM IR; otherwise, it will produce; LLVM IR bitcode. * **Compiler backend**: This converts the intermediate representation; into target-specific assembly code.; The ``-S`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Assembler**: This converts target-specific assembly code into; target-specific machine code object files.; The ``-c`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Linker**: This combines multiple object files into a single image; (either a shared object or an executable). Clang provides all of these pieces other than the linker. When multiple; steps are performed by the same tool, it is common for the steps to be; fused together to avoid creating intermediate files. When given an output of one of the above steps as an input, earlier steps; are skipped (for instance, a ``.s`` file input will be assembled and linked).

Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling. Differences Between Sampling and Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although both techniques are used for similar purposes, there are important; differences between the two:. 1. Profile data generated with one cannot be used by the other, and there is no; conversion tool that can convert one to the other. So, a profile generated; via ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` must be used with; ``-fprofile-use`` or ``-fprofile-instr-use``. Similarly, sampling profiles; generated by external profilers must be converted and used with ``-fprofile-sample-use``; or ``-fauto-profile``. 2. Instrumentation profile data can be used for code coverage analysis and; optimization. 3. Sampling profiles can only be used for optimization. They cannot be used for; code coverage analysis. Although it would be technically possible to use; sampling profiles for code coverage, sample-based profiles are too; coarse-grained for code coverage purposes; it would yield poor results. 4. Sampling profiles must be generated by an external tool. The profile; generated by that tool must then be converted into a format that can be read; by LLVM. The section on sampling profilers describes one of the supported; sampling profile formats. Using Sampling Profilers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sampling profilers are used to collect runtime information, such as; hardware counters, while your application executes. They are typically; very efficient and do not incur a large runtime overhead.

Performance,"ngs; ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,; there are six levels of atomicity. They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:6584,load,loads,6584,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

A progress bar is a widget that shows that an operation is in progress; and how much time is left. It is a long rectangular bar, initially; empty, that fills with a color as a process is being performed. The; filled-in area indicates the percentage of the process that has been; completed. You should use this widget for waits exceeding `one minute`.; For a very time consuming operation it is better to break the operation; into subtasks and provide a progress bar for each of them. ![](pictures/0200021E.jpg). A progress bar may be oriented horizontally or vertically. The; horizontally oriented progress bar fills with a color from left to; right; the vertically oriented - from bottom to top. A percent complete; message provides an indication of the completed part of the process. It; is a good practice to include some descriptive text of the process to; keep users informed and entertained while they are waiting for process; completion.

Performance,"nits that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant. If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module. A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific; numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces; may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target; instructions are used to access the variable. The default address space; is zero. The address space qualifier must precede any other attributes. LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals to the section specified.; Additionally, the global can placed in a comdat if the target has the necessary; support. External declarations may have an explicit section specified. Section; information is retained in LLVM IR for targets that make use of this; information.

Performance,"nk the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the shared object is lazily loaded. Phase 2 : Symbol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``.

Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view.

The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run.

Performance,"no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.2; }. In this example, the loads from the G and H global variables are; explicit in the LLVM IR, and they live in the then/else branches of the; if statement (cond\_true/cond\_false). In order to merge the incoming; values, the X.2 phi node in the cond\_next block selects the right value; to use based on where control flow is coming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form. For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_.

Performance,"non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`. The; performance depends not only of the processor type, but also of the disk; devices (local, NFS, AFS, etc.). ## Chains; \index{tree!chains}. A **`TChain`** object is a list of ROOT files containing the same tree.; As an example, assume we have three files called; `file1.root, file2.root, file3.root`. Each file contains one tree called; ""`T`"". We can create a chain with the following statements:. ``` {.cpp}; TChain chain(""T""); // name of the tree is the argument; chain.Add(""file1.root"");; chain.Add(""file2.root"");; chain.Add(""file3.root"");; ```. The name of the **`TChain`** will be the same as the name of the tree;; in this case it will be `""T"". Note that two `objects can have the same; name as long as they are not histograms in the same directory, because; there, the histogram names are used to build a hash table. The class; **`TChain`** is derived from the class **`TTree`**. For example, to; generate a histogram corresponding to the attribute ""`x`"" in tree ""`T`""; by processing sequentially the three files of this chain, we can use the;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:140042,perform,performance,140042,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"non-static data members of Objective-C++ non-union class types; * Objective-C++ objects and arrays of dynamic storage duration created; with the ``new`` or ``new[]`` operators and destroyed with the; corresponding ``delete`` or ``delete[]`` operator. They are not followed automatically for these objects:. * objects of dynamic storage duration created in other memory, such as; that returned by ``malloc``; * union members. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC must perform special operations when initializing an object and; when destroying it. In many common situations, ARC knows when an; object is created and when it is destroyed and can ensure that these; operations are performed correctly. Otherwise, however, ARC requires; programmer cooperation to establish its initialization invariants; because it is infeasible for ARC to dynamically infer whether they; are intact. For example, there is no syntactic difference in C between; an assignment that is intended by the programmer to initialize a variable; and one that is intended to replace the existing value stored there,; but ARC must perform one operation or the other. ARC chooses to always; assume that objects are initialized (except when it is in charge of; initializing them) because the only workable alternative would be to; ban all code patterns that could potentially be used to access; uninitialized memory, and that would be too limiting. In practice,; this is rarely a problem because programmers do not generally need to; work with objects for which the requirements are not handled; automatically. Note that dynamically-allocated Objective-C++ arrays of; nontrivially-ownership-qualified type are not ABI-compatible with non-ARC; code because the non-ARC code will consider the element type to be POD.; Such arrays that are ``new[]``'d in ARC translation units cannot be; ``delete[]``'d in non-ARC translation units and vice-versa. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.pass_by_writeback:.

The; transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz; transformations and Poincare transformations, which are; translation`/`rotation combinations. Each group has several members; which may model physically equivalent transformations but with different; internal representations. Transformation classes can operate on all type; of vectors by using the operator `() `or the operator `*` and the; transformations can be combined via the operator `*`. The available; transformations are:. - 3D rotation classes. - rotation described by a 3x3 matrix (**`ROOT::Math::Rotation3D`**). - rotation described by Euler angles (**`ROOT::Math::EulerAngles`**). - rotation described by a direction axis and an angle; (**`ROOT::Math::AxisAngle`**). - rotation described by a quaternion (**`ROOT::Math::Quaternion`**). - optimized rotation around `x` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationX`**), `y`; (**`ROOT::Math::RotationY`**) and `z` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationZ`**); and described by just one angle. - 3D transformation: we describe the transformations defined as a; composition between a rotation and a translation using the class; **`ROOT::Math::Transform3D`**. It is important to note that; transformations act differently on vectors and points.

Because nothing is known about the behavior of ``ModulePass``; subclasses, no optimization can be done for their execution. A module pass can use function level passes (e.g. dominators) using the; ``getAnalysis`` interface ``getAnalysis<DominatorTree>(llvm::Function *)`` to; provide the function to retrieve analysis result for, if the function pass does; not require any module or immutable passes. Note that this can only be done; for functions for which the analysis ran, e.g. in the case of dominators you; should only ask for the ``DominatorTree`` for function definitions, not; declarations.

Performance,"ns for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables. Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode. This prevents optimizations which might affect results if the rounding mode changes or is different from the default; for example, it prevents floating-point operations from being reordered across most calls and prevents constant-folding when the result is not exactly representable. .. option:: -ffp-model=<value>.

Performance,"ns to be; aware of. Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:.

Because metadata nodes are immutable (with the exception of; ``MDNode::replaceOperandWith`` which is dangerous to use on uniqued; metadata), in order to add or remove a loop attributes, a new ``MDNode``; must be created and assigned as the new ``llvm.loop`` metadata. Any; connection between the old ``MDNode`` and the loop is lost. The; ``llvm.loop`` node is also used as LoopID (``Loop::getLoopID()``), i.e.; the loop effectively gets a new identifier. For instance,; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` references the LoopID. Therefore, if; the parallel access property is to be preserved after adding/removing; loop attributes, any ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` reference must be; updated to the new LoopID. Transformation Metadata Structure; =================================. Some attributes describe code transformations (unrolling, vectorizing,; loop distribution, etc.). They can either be a hint to the optimizer; that a transformation might be beneficial, instruction to use a specific; option, , or convey a specific request from the user (such as; ``#pragma clang loop`` or ``#pragma omp simd``). If a transformation is forced but cannot be carried-out for any reason,; an optimization-missed warning must be emitted. Semantic information; such as a transformation being safe (e.g.; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``) can be unused by the optimizer; without generating a warning. Unless explicitly disabled, any optimization pass may heuristically; determine whether a transformation is beneficial and apply it. If; metadata for another transformation was specified, applying a different; transformation before it might be inadvertent due to being applied on a; different loop or the loop not existing anymore.

Performance,"ns; --------------------------------------. The LLVM IR does not define any way to start parallel threads of; execution or to register signal handlers. Nonetheless, there are; platform-specific ways to create them, and we define LLVM IR's behavior; in their presence. This model is inspired by the C++ memory model. For a more informal introduction to this model, see the :doc:`Atomics`. We define a *happens-before* partial order as the least partial order; that. - Is a superset of single-thread program order, and; - When ``a`` *synchronizes-with* ``b``, includes an edge from ``a`` to; ``b``. *Synchronizes-with* pairs are introduced by platform-specific; techniques, like pthread locks, thread creation, thread joining,; etc., and by atomic instructions. (See also :ref:`Atomic Memory Ordering; Constraints <ordering>`). Note that program order does not introduce *happens-before* edges; between a thread and signals executing inside that thread. Every (defined) read operation (load instructions, memcpy, atomic; loads/read-modify-writes, etc.) R reads a series of bytes written by; (defined) write operations (store instructions, atomic; stores/read-modify-writes, memcpy, etc.). For the purposes of this; section, initialized globals are considered to have a write of the; initializer which is atomic and happens before any other read or write; of the memory in question. For each byte of a read R, R\ :sub:`byte`; may see any write to the same byte, except:. - If write\ :sub:`1` happens before write\ :sub:`2`, and; write\ :sub:`2` happens before R\ :sub:`byte`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`1`.; - If R\ :sub:`byte` happens before write\ :sub:`3`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`3`. Given that definition, R\ :sub:`byte` is defined as follows:. - If R is volatile, the result is target-dependent.

Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state. We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

Performance,"nsistent with target distributions. We strongly encourage looking at ``clang/cmake/caches/MultiDistributionExample.cmake``; as an example of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO.

In this section we will discuss briefly the `TNtuple` class, which is a; simplified version of the `TTree` class. A ROOT `TNtuple` object can; store rows of float entries. Let's tackle the problem according to the; usual strategy commenting a minimal example. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_ntuple_to_file.C; ```. This data written to this example n-tuple represents, in the statistical; sense, three independent variables (Potential or Voltage, Pressure and; Temperature), and one variable (Current) which depends on the others; according to very simple laws, and an additional Gaussian smearing. This; set of variables mimics a measurement of an electrical resistance while; varying pressure and temperature. Imagine your task now consists in finding the relations among the; variables -- of course without knowing the code used to generate them.; You will see that the possibilities of the `NTuple` class enable you to; perform this analysis task. Open the ROOT file (`cond_data.root`); written by the macro above in an interactive session and use a; `TBrowser` to interactively inspect it:. ``` {.cpp}; root[0] TBrowser b; ```; You find the columns of your n-tuple written as *leafs*.

Next, try the following commands at the shell prompt and in the; interactive ROOT shell, respectively:. ``` {.cpp}; > root conductivity_experiment.root; Attaching file conductivity_experiment.root as _file0...; root [0] cond_data->Draw(""Current:Potential""); ```.

Therefore, if; the parallel access property is to be preserved after adding/removing; loop attributes, any ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` reference must be; updated to the new LoopID. Transformation Metadata Structure; =================================. Some attributes describe code transformations (unrolling, vectorizing,; loop distribution, etc.). They can either be a hint to the optimizer; that a transformation might be beneficial, instruction to use a specific; option, , or convey a specific request from the user (such as; ``#pragma clang loop`` or ``#pragma omp simd``). If a transformation is forced but cannot be carried-out for any reason,; an optimization-missed warning must be emitted. Semantic information; such as a transformation being safe (e.g.; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``) can be unused by the optimizer; without generating a warning. Unless explicitly disabled, any optimization pass may heuristically; determine whether a transformation is beneficial and apply it. If; metadata for another transformation was specified, applying a different; transformation before it might be inadvertent due to being applied on a; different loop or the loop not existing anymore. To avoid having to; explicitly disable an unknown number of passes, the attribute; ``llvm.loop.disable_nonforced`` disables all optional, high-level,; restructuring transformations. The following example avoids the loop being altered before being; vectorized, for instance being unrolled. .. code-block:: llvm. br i1 %exitcond, label %for.exit, label %for.header, !llvm.loop !0; ...; !0 = distinct !{!0, !1, !2}; !1 = !{!""llvm.loop.vectorize.enable"", i1 true}; !2 = !{!""llvm.loop.disable_nonforced""}.

Performance,"nstrInfo::loadRegFromStackSlot``. The indirect mapping shields the application developer from the complexities of; inserting load and store instructions. In order to map a virtual register to a; physical one, use ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2Phys(vreg, preg)``. In order to map; a certain virtual register to memory, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg)``. This method will return the stack; slot where ``vreg``'s value will be located. If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instructions in the code. Every virtual that has; been mapped to a stack slot will be stored to memory after being defined and will; be loaded before being used. The implementation of the spiller tries to recycle; load/store instructions, avoiding unnecessary instructions. For an example of; how to invoke the spiller, see ``RegAllocLinearScan::runOnMachineFunction`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/RegAllocLinearScan.cpp``. Handling two address instructions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. With very rare exceptions (e.g., function calls), the LLVM machine code; instructions are three address instructions. That is, each instruction is; expected to define at most one register, and to use at most two registers.; However, some architectures use two address instructions.

We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention. We could define a new ABI and/or calling convention to explicitly pass the; predicate state in and out of functions. This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks. [Most](https://lwn.net/Articles/743265/); [discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:43319,perform,performance,43319,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`.

Required passes will still be run on ``optnone`` functions. For more implementation details, see; ``PassInstrumentation::runBeforePass()``. Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Name##PluginInfo();``; - ``extern ""C"" ::llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo llvmGetPassPluginInfo() LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK;``. Pass plugins are compiled and linked dynamically by default. Setting; ``LLVM_${NAME}_LINK_INTO_TOOLS`` to ``ON`` turns the project into a statically; linked extension.

The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself. You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAULT)).

Performance,"nter (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``. Since the second argument to the GEP instruction must always; be a value of pointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there.

Passing strings (the ``StringRef`` and ``Twine`` classes); ---------------------------------------------------------. Although LLVM generally does not do much string manipulation, we do have several; important APIs which take strings. Two important examples are the Value class; -- which has names for instructions, functions, etc. -- and the ``StringMap``; class which is used extensively in LLVM and Clang. These are generic classes, and they need to be able to accept strings which may; have embedded null characters. Therefore, they cannot simply take a ``const; char *``, and taking a ``const std::string&`` requires clients to perform a heap; allocation which is usually unnecessary. Instead, many LLVM APIs use a; ``StringRef`` or a ``const Twine&`` for passing strings efficiently. .. _StringRef:. The ``StringRef`` class; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``StringRef`` data type represents a reference to a constant string (a; character array and a length) and supports the common operations available on; ``std::string``, but does not require heap allocation. It can be implicitly constructed using a C style null-terminated string, an; ``std::string``, or explicitly with a character pointer and length. For; example, the ``StringMap`` find function is declared as:. .. code-block:: c++. iterator find(StringRef Key);. and clients can call it using any one of:. .. code-block:: c++. Map.find(""foo""); // Lookup ""foo""; Map.find(std::string(""bar"")); // Lookup ""bar""; Map.find(StringRef(""\0baz"", 4)); // Lookup ""\0baz"".

Block pointers track a ``Pointee``, the block to which they point, along; with a ``Base`` and an ``Offset``. The base identifies the innermost field,; while the offset points to an array element relative to the base (including; one-past-end pointers). The offset identifies the array element or field; which is referenced, while the base points to the outer object or array which; contains the field.

Mark invariant locations using !invariant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order.

Performance,"nts:. * No variable argument lists are used. Example:. Call as ``llc -tailcallopt test.ll``. .. code-block:: llvm. declare fastcc i32 @tailcallee(i32 inreg %a1, i32 inreg %a2, i32 %a3, i32 %a4). define fastcc i32 @tailcaller(i32 %in1, i32 %in2) {; %l1 = add i32 %in1, %in2; %tmp = tail call fastcc i32 @tailcallee(i32 inreg %in1, i32 inreg %in2, i32 %in1, i32 %l1); ret i32 %tmp; }. Implications of ``-tailcallopt``:. To support tail call optimization in situations where the callee has more; arguments than the caller a 'callee pops arguments' convention is used. This; currently causes each ``fastcc`` call that is not tail call optimized (because; one or more of above constraints are not met) to be followed by a readjustment; of the stack. So performance might be worse in such cases. Sibling call optimization; -------------------------. Sibling call optimization is a restricted form of tail call optimization.; Unlike tail call optimization described in the previous section, it can be; performed automatically on any tail calls when ``-tailcallopt`` option is not; specified. Sibling call optimization is currently performed on x86/x86-64 when the; following constraints are met:. * Caller and callee have the same calling convention. It can be either ``c`` or; ``fastcc``. * The call is a tail call - in tail position (ret immediately follows call and; ret uses value of call or is void). * Caller and callee have matching return type or the callee result is not used. * If any of the callee arguments are being passed in stack, they must be; available in caller's own incoming argument stack and the frame offsets must; be the same. Example:. .. code-block:: llvm. declare i32 @bar(i32, i32). define i32 @foo(i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c) {; entry:; %0 = tail call i32 @bar(i32 %a, i32 %b); ret i32 %0; }. The X86 backend; ---------------. The X86 code generator lives in the ``lib/Target/X86`` directory.

Performance,"numVal``"" macros ensure that the command; line arguments matched the enum values. With this option added, our help output; now is:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options] <input file>. OPTIONS:; Choose optimization level:; -g - No optimizations, enable debugging; -O1 - Enable trivial optimizations; -O2 - Enable default optimizations; -O3 - Enable expensive optimizations; -f - Enable binary output on terminals; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename; -quiet - Don't print informational messages. In this case, it is sort of awkward that flag names correspond directly to enum; names, because we probably don't want an enum definition named ""``g``"" in our; program. Because of this, we can alternatively write this example like this:. .. code-block:: c++. enum OptLevel {; Debug, O1, O2, O3; };. cl::opt<OptLevel> OptimizationLevel(cl::desc(""Choose optimization level:""),; cl::values(; clEnumValN(Debug, ""g"", ""No optimizations, enable debugging""),; clEnumVal(O1 , ""Enable trivial optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O2 , ""Enable default optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O3 , ""Enable expensive optimizations"")));. ...; if (OptimizationLevel == Debug) outputDebugInfo(...);; ... By using the ""``clEnumValN``"" macro instead of ""``clEnumVal``"", we can directly; specify the name that the flag should get. In general a direct mapping is nice,; but sometimes you can't or don't want to preserve the mapping, which is when you; would use it. Named Alternatives; ------------------. Another useful argument form is a named alternative style. We shall use this; style in our compiler to specify different debug levels that can be used.; Instead of each debug level being its own switch, we want to support the; following options, of which only one can be specified at a time:; ""``--debug-level=none``"", ""``--debug-level=quick``"",; ""``--debug-level=detailed``"".

A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint. This prevents the optimizer; from performing unsound optimizations.; #. recording a mapping of live pointers (and the allocation they're; associated with) for each statepoint. At the most abstract level, inserting a safepoint can be thought of as; replacing a call instruction with a call to a multiple return value; function which both calls the original target of the call, returns; its result, and returns updated values for any live pointers to; garbage collected objects. Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below.

Performance,"o hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`.

The user must therefore be aware of the fact; that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then; the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of; most machines. The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course,; so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the; ''parabolic'' parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users; should however realize that the transformation is only a linear; approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or; more parameters is very close to a limit, where; $\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0$. Therefore, it is; recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the; limits should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits. ### How to Get the Right Answer from Minuit. `Minuit` offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms.; The `MIGRAD` algorithm is in general the best minimized for nearly all; functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line search, a; stable metric updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness.; Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first; derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very inaccurate. If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the side effects, then the; user should be aware of the following techniques to alleviate problems; caused by limits:. #### Getting the Right Minimum with Limits. If MIGRAD converges normally to a point where no parameter is near one; of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not prevented; `Minuit` from finding the right minimum.

The structure consists of the encoding; `types <cvmtypes_>`_ like variable-length unsigned integers, that; are used to encode `File ID Mapping`_, `Counter Expressions`_ and; the `Mapping Regions`_. The format of the structure follows:. ``[file id mapping, counter expressions, mapping regions]``. The translation unit filenames are encoded using the same encoding; `types <cvmtypes_>`_ as the per-function coverage mapping data, with the; following structure:. ``[numFilenames : LEB128, filename0 : string, filename1 : string, ...]``. .. _cvmtypes:. Types; -----. This section describes the basic types that are used by the encoding format; and can appear after ``:`` in the ``[foo : type]`` description. .. _LEB128:. LEB128; ^^^^^^. LEB128 is an unsigned integer value that is encoded using DWARF's LEB128; encoding, optimizing for the case where values are small; (1 byte for values less than 128). .. _CoverageStrings:.

LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions.

The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables.

By default the compiler runtime uses a static initializer to determine the; profile output path and to register a writer function. To collect profiles; without using static initializers, do this manually:. * Export a ``int __llvm_profile_runtime`` symbol from each instrumented shared; library and executable. When the linker finds a definition of this symbol, it; knows to skip loading the object which contains the profiling runtime's; static initializer. * Forward-declare ``void __llvm_profile_initialize_file(void)`` and call it; once from each instrumented executable. This function parses; ``LLVM_PROFILE_FILE``, sets the output path, and truncates any existing files; at that path. To get the same behavior without truncating existing files,; pass a filename pattern string to ``void __llvm_profile_set_filename(char; *)``. These calls can be placed anywhere so long as they precede all calls; to ``__llvm_profile_write_file``. * Forward-declare ``int __llvm_profile_write_file(void)`` and call it to write; out a profile. This function returns 0 when it succeeds, and a non-zero value; otherwise. Calling this function multiple times appends profile data to an; existing on-disk raw profile.

This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR. Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }. With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly. While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate.

Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```.

At this point, the ObjectBufferStream contains the raw object image.; Before the code can be executed, the code and data sections from this; image must be loaded into suitable memory, relocations must be applied and; memory permission and code cache invalidation (if required) must be completed. Object Loading; ==============. Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or; having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld to; be loaded. The RuntimeDyld wrapper class examines the object to determine; its file format and creates an instance of either RuntimeDyldELF or; RuntimeDyldMachO (both of which derive from the RuntimeDyldImpl base; class) and calls the RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject method to perform that; actual loading. .. image:: MCJIT-dyld-load.png.

ObjectImage, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:4021,load,loadObject,4021,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,1,['load'],['loadObject']

Performance,"oc:`CMake` or :doc:`CMakePrimer`; documentation useful. Some of the things covered in this document are the inner; workings of the builds described in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:1438,perform,performance,1438,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

Reading and writing references in the heap; ------------------------------------------. Some collectors need to be informed when the mutator (the program that needs; garbage collection) either reads a pointer from or writes a pointer to a field; of a heap object. The code fragments inserted at these points are called *read; barriers* and *write barriers*, respectively. The amount of code that needs to; be executed is usually quite small and not on the critical path of any; computation, so the overall performance impact of the barrier is tolerable. Barriers often require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n.

It is worth noting that -; on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads; running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected; for your storage medium: this would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage; medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck.; The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use; use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4,; possibly at the cost of some extra file size. ### A note on caching. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed.

Performance,"ocalException is a function; implemented by the C++ support library. It returns the current exception ; object for the current thread. Note that we do not attempt to recycle the ; shutdown code from before, because performance of the mainline code is ; critically important. Also, obviously fooCleanup and barCleanup may be ; merged and one of them eliminated. This just shows how the code generator ; would most likely emit code. The bazCleanup label is more interesting. Because the exception may be caught; by the try block, we must dispatch to its handler... but it does not exist; on the call stack (it does not have a VM Call->Label mapping installed), so ; we must dispatch statically with a goto. The bazHandler thus appears as:. bazHandler:; d->~D(); // destruct D as it goes out of scope when entering catch clauses; goto TryHandler. In general, TryHandler is not the same as bazHandler, because multiple ; function calls could be made from the try block. In this case, trivial ; optimization could merge the two basic blocks. TryHandler is the code ; that actually determines the type of exception, based on the Exception object; itself. For this discussion, assume that the exception object contains *at; least*:. 1. A pointer to the RTTI info for the contained object; 2. A pointer to the dtor for the contained object; 3. The contained object itself. Note that it is necessary to maintain #1 & #2 in the exception object itself; because objects without virtual function tables may be thrown (as in this ; example). Assuming this, TryHandler would look something like this:.

The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones.

Performance,"ocument goes over how ``MemorySSA`` is structured, and some basic; intuition on how ``MemorySSA`` works. A paper on MemorySSA (with notes about how it's implemented in GCC) `can be; found here <http://www.airs.com/dnovillo/Papers/mem-ssa.pdf>`_. Though, it's; relatively out-of-date; the paper references multiple memory partitions, but GCC; eventually swapped to just using one, like we now have in LLVM. Like; GCC's, LLVM's MemorySSA is intraprocedural. MemorySSA Structure; ===================. MemorySSA is a virtual IR. After it's built, ``MemorySSA`` will contain a; structure that maps ``Instruction``\ s to ``MemoryAccess``\ es, which are; ``MemorySSA``'s parallel to LLVM ``Instruction``\ s. Each ``MemoryAccess`` can be one of three types:. - ``MemoryDef``; - ``MemoryPhi``; - ``MemoryUse``. ``MemoryDef``\ s are operations which may either modify memory, or which; introduce some kind of ordering constraints. Examples of ``MemoryDef``\ s; include ``store``\ s, function calls, ``load``\ s with ``acquire`` (or higher); ordering, volatile operations, memory fences, etc. A ``MemoryDef``; always introduces a new version of the entire memory and is linked with a single; ``MemoryDef/MemoryPhi`` which is the version of memory that the new; version is based on. This implies that there is a *single*; ``Def`` chain that connects all the ``Def``\ s, either directly; or indirectly. For example in:. .. code-block:: llvm. b = MemoryDef(a); c = MemoryDef(b); d = MemoryDef(c). ``d`` is connected directly with ``c`` and indirectly with ``b``.; This means that ``d`` potentially clobbers (see below) ``c`` *or*; ``b`` *or* both. This in turn implies that without the use of `The walker`_,; initially every ``MemoryDef`` clobbers every other ``MemoryDef``. ``MemoryPhi``\ s are ``PhiNode``\ s, but for memory operations. If at any; point we have two (or more) ``MemoryDef``\ s that could flow into a; ``BasicBlock``, the block's top ``MemoryAccess`` will be a; ``MemoryPhi``.

Now it supports the case of globbing files while also using the `?#` token to specify the tree name. ## RDataFrame; - instead of returning nothing, `ROOT::RDF::RunGraphs` now returns the number of separate computation graphs that have been run. - Introduce [`ProgressBar`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html#progressbar) feature that can be added to any RDataFrame program. - The `RDatasetSpec` class and its users now employ the concept of 'sample' rather than the original naming 'group' for groups of files with associated metadata. - `df106_HiggsToFourLeptons` tutorials (both python and C++) now showcase the `ProgressBar`. They now use `FromSpec` to define multiple samples and `Vary` for systematic variations. ### Distributed RDataFrame. - Vastly improve runtime performance when using an RDataFrame with simulated dataset, i.e. `RDataFrame(nentries)`, by removing usage of `Range` operation to define the per-task entry range. - Explicitly error out when trying to process a TTree with a TTreeIndex in distributed mode.

LLVM Optimization Passes; ========================. LLVM provides many optimization passes, which do many different sorts of; things and have different tradeoffs. Unlike other systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_.

Note that this guarantee is cheap on common; platforms for loads of a native width, but can be expensive or unavailable for; wider loads, like a 64-bit store on ARM. (A frontend for Java or other ""safe""; languages would normally split a 64-bit store on ARM into two 32-bit unordered; stores.). Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this prohibits any transformation that transforms a; single load into multiple loads, transforms a store into multiple stores,; narrows a store, or stores a value which would not be stored otherwise. Some; examples of unsafe optimizations are narrowing an assignment into a bitfield,; rematerializing a load, and turning loads and stores into a memcpy; call. Reordering unordered operations is safe, though, and optimizers should; take advantage of that because unordered operations are common in languages; that need them. Notes for code generation; These operations are required to be atomic in the sense that if you use; unordered loads and unordered stores, a load cannot see a value which was; never stored. A normal load or store instruction is usually sufficient, but; note that an unordered load or store cannot be split into multiple; instructions (or an instruction which does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM). Monotonic; ---------. Monotonic is the weakest level of atomicity that can be used in synchronization; primitives, although it does not provide any general synchronization. It; essentially guarantees that if you take all the operations affecting a specific; address, a consistent ordering exists. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.

This decision; is based on whether the detected bug is one that would prevent the program under; analysis from continuing. For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification. This ExplodedNode will be the one; returned by the most recent call to CheckerContext::addTransition.; If no transition has been performed during the current callback, the checker should call CheckerContext::addTransition(); and use the returned node for bug reporting. If analysis can not continue, then the current state should be transitioned; into a so-called sink node, a node from which no further analysis will be; performed. This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node. Like; addTransition, this returns an ExplodedNode with the updated; state, which can then be passed to the BugReport constructor. After a BugReport is created, it should be passed to the analyzer core; by calling CheckerContext::emitReport. AST Visitors; Some checks might not require path-sensitivity to be effective.

We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own. For instance, `cat header.h header.h | gcc -fsyntax-only -xc++ -`.; This command concatenates `header.h` twice before compiling it to make sure; it has proper include protectors.; * Enable it in `rootcling` -- rootcling can produce a C++ Modules-aware; dictionary when it is invoked with `-cxxmodule` flag.; * Modularization of external dependencies -- if a header file is not explicitly; nominated as part of a module and it is transitively included in two modules,; both modules contain that header file content. In other words, the header is; duplicated. In turn, this leads to performance regressions. If a dictionary; depends on a header (directly or indirectly) from a external library (e.g.; libxml) it needs to be modularized. As part of our ongoing efforts to move; CMSSW to use C++ Modules [[6]] we have implemented a helper tool [[7]]. The; tool detects (based on the include paths of the compiler) dependencies and; tries to generate the relevant vfs file. ## State of the union.

For reminder, a geometry state is a ‘touchable' object in the geometry; hierarchy. It is represented by a path like: `/TOP\_1/A\_1/B\_3/C\_1`,; where `B\_3` for instance is a copy of volume `B` positioned inside; volume `A`. A state is always associated to a transformation matrix; `M` of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame; (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch; with respect to their containers). The current state and the; corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is; modified. The global transformations corresponding to all nodes in the; current branch are kept in an array: (`MTOP\_1, MA\_1, MB\_3, ...`). \image html geometry015.png ""Navigation in the geometry hierarchy"" width=600px.

Once these managers are set up, we use a series of ""addPass"" calls to add a; bunch of LLVM transform passes:. .. code-block:: c++. // Add transform passes.; // Do simple ""peephole"" optimizations and bit-twiddling optzns.; TheFPM->addPass(InstCombinePass());; // Reassociate expressions.; TheFPM->addPass(ReassociatePass());; // Eliminate Common SubExpressions.; TheFPM->addPass(GVNPass());; // Simplify the control flow graph (deleting unreachable blocks, etc).; TheFPM->addPass(SimplifyCFGPass());.

We copy the code from the original to the instrumentation version; by tracing the LLVM-to-Machine code basic block map and then copying; each machine code basic block we think is in the hot region into the; trace cache. Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code. So we have to keep the; code copies in memory near the original code (they can't be far enough; away that a single pc-relative branch would not work.) Malloc() or; data region space is too far away. this impacts the design of the ; trace cache. We use a dummy function that is full of a bunch of for loops which we; overwrite with trace-cache code. The trace manager keeps track of; whether or not we have enough space in the trace cache, etc. The trace insertion routine takes an original start address, a vector; of machine instructions representing the trace, index of branches and; their corresponding absolute targets, and index of calls and their; corresponding absolute targets. The trace insertion routine is responsible for inserting branches from; the beginning of the original code to the beginning of the optimized; trace. This is because at some point the trace cache may run out of; space and it may have to evict a trace, at which point the branch to; the trace would also have to be removed.

Performance,"of a cluster size for the TTree. The TTreeCache; prefilling is also enabled by default; when in learning phase rather than; reading each requested branch individually, the TTreeCache will read all the; branches thus trading off the latencies inherent to multiple small reads for; the potential of requesting more data than needed by read from the disk or; server the baskets for too many branches. The default behavior can be changed by either updating one of the rootrc files; or by setting environment variables. The rootrc files, both the global and the; local ones, now support the following the resource variable TTreeCache.Size; which set the default size factor for auto sizing TTreeCache for TTrees. The; estimated cluster size for the TTree and this factor is used to give the cache; size. If option is set to zero auto cache creation is disabled and the default; cache size is the historical one (equivalent to factor 1.0). If set to; non zero auto cache creation is enabled and both auto created and; default sized caches will use the configured factor: 0.0 no automatic cache; and greater than 0.0 to enable cache. This value can be overridden by the; environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE. The resource variable TTreeCache.Prefill sets the default TTreeCache prefilling; type. The prefill type may be: 0 for no prefilling and 1 to prefill all; the branches. It can be overridden by the environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_PREFILL.

This allows code generators to; trivially support native debuggers by generating standard dwarf; information, and contains enough information for non-dwarf targets to; translate it as needed.

Performance,"of having Cling interpret your script there is a way to have your; scripts compiled, linked and dynamically loaded using the C++ compiler; and linker. The advantage of this is that your scripts will run with the; speed of compiled C++ and that you can use language constructs that are; not fully supported by Cling. On the other hand, you cannot use any Cling; shortcuts (see ""C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting"" above) and for small scripts, the; overhead of the compile/link cycle might be larger than just executing; the script in the interpreter. ACLiC will build a dictionary and a shared library from your C++; script, using the compiler and the compiler options that were used to; compile the ROOT executable. You do not have to write a Makefile; remembering the correct compiler options, and you do not have to exit; ROOT. ### Usage. Before you can compile your interpreted script you need to add include; statements for the classes used in the script. Once you did that, you; can build and load a shared library containing your script. To load it; use the command `.L` and append the file name with a `+`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+; ```. The + option generates the shared library and names it by taking; the name of the file ""filename"" but replacing the dot before the; extension by an underscore and by adding the shared library extension; for the current platform. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx`; will generate `hsimple_cxx.so`. The + command rebuild the library only if the script or any of the; files it includes are newer than the library. When checking the; timestamp, ACLiC generates a dependency file which name is the same as; the library name, just replacing the 'so' extension by the extension; 'd'. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx` will generate; `hsimple_cxx.d`. To ensure that the shared library is rebuilt you can use the ++; syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```.

This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so dropping the statements is OK).

In many cases the true; type can't really be known until the code is corrected (e.g. a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved.

Next, ``%{outer}`` expands, and the output of; the ``echo`` command becomes:. .. code-block:: shell. %{inner}. Of course, one way to fix this simple case is to reverse the definitions of; ``%{outer}`` and ``%{inner}``. However, if a test has a complex set of; substitutions that can all reference each other, there might not exist a; sufficient substitution order. To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list.

Offload Device Compilation; --------------------------. The input file is compiled for each active device toolchain. The device; compilation stage is performed differently from the host stage. Namely, we do; not generate any offloading entries. This is set by passing the; ``-fopenmp-is-target-device`` flag to the front-end. We use the host bitcode to; determine which symbols to export from the device. The bitcode file is passed in; from the previous stage using the ``-fopenmp-host-ir-file-path`` flag.; Compilation is otherwise performed as it would be for any other target triple. When compiling for the OpenMP device, we set the visibility of all device; symbols to be ``protected`` by default. This improves performance and prevents a; class of errors where a symbol in the target device could preempt a host; library. The OpenMP runtime library is linked in during compilation to provide the; implementations for standard OpenMP functionality. For GPU targets this is done; by linking in a special bitcode library during compilation, (e.g.; ``libomptarget-nvptx64-sm_70.bc``) using the ``-mlink-builtin-bitcode`` flag.; Other device libraries, such as CUDA's libdevice, are also linked this way.

Pointer type for ObjC blocks. Defined in ``""ObjCBlockPointer.h""``. Composite types; ---------------. The interpreter distinguishes two kinds of composite types: arrays and; records (structs and classes). Unions are represented as records, except; at most a single field can be marked as active. The contents of inactive; fields are kept until they are reactivated and overwritten.; Complex numbers (``_Complex``) and vectors; (``__attribute((vector_size(16)))``) are treated as arrays. Bytecode Execution; ==================. Bytecode is executed using a stack-based interpreter. The execution; context consists of an ``InterpStack``, along with a chain of; ``InterpFrame`` objects storing the call frames. Frames are built by; call instructions and destroyed by return instructions. They perform; one allocation to reserve space for all locals in a single block.; These objects store all the required information to emit stack traces; whenever evaluation fails. Memory Organisation; ===================. Memory management in the interpreter relies on 3 data structures: ``Block``; objects which store the data and associated inline metadata, ``Pointer``; objects which refer to or into blocks, and ``Descriptor`` structures which; describe blocks and subobjects nested inside blocks. Blocks; ------. Blocks contain data interleaved with metadata. They are allocated either; statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter; values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame; containing the local variables of a function. Blocks are associated with a; descriptor that characterises the entire allocation, along with a few; additional attributes:. * ``IsStatic`` indicates whether the block has static duration in the; interpreter, i.e. it is not a local in a frame. * ``DeclI",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst:3778,perform,perform,3778,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ConstantInterpreter.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

The node returned is the; one pointed by the input path in case the shape is crossed; otherwise; the returned value is NULL. In case the distance to next crossed; boundary is required, the current point has to be physically INSIDE the; shape pointed by the current volume. This is only insured in case a call; to `TGeoManager::FindNode()` was performed for the current point.; Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and; direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to; compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for; particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than; 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here. After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to; the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by; **`TGeoManager`**`::FindNextDaughterBoundary().` This computes the; distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by; using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in; case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a; simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside; each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step; value is again updated if `step<stepmax` . A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly; overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is; computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account; the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes "").

Performance,"oint in trying to guarantee correctness in the; presence of race conditions. ARC does not have a stack-scanning; garbage collector, and guaranteeing the atomicity of every load and; store operation would be prohibitive and preclude a vast amount of; optimization. ARC may assume that non-ARC code engages in sensible balancing; behavior and does not rely on exact or minimum retain count values; except as guaranteed by ``__strong`` object invariants or +1 transfer; conventions. For example, if an object is provably double-retained; and double-released, ARC may eliminate the inner retain and release;; it does not need to guard against code which performs an unbalanced; release followed by a ""balancing"" retain. .. _arc.optimization.liveness:. Object liveness; ---------------. ARC may not allow a retainable object ``X`` to be deallocated at a; time ``T`` in a computation history if:. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; :ref:`precise lifetime semantics <arc.optimization.precise>`, or. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; imprecise lifetime semantics and, at some point after ``T`` but; before the next store to ``S``, the computation history features a; load from ``S`` and in some way depends on the value loaded, or. * ``X`` is a value described as being released at the end of the; current full-expression and, at some point after ``T`` but before; the end of the full-expression, the computation history depends; on that value. .. admonition:: Rationale. The intent of the second rule is to say that objects held in normal; ``__strong`` local variables may be released as soon as the value in; the variable is no longer being used: either the variable stops; being used completely or a new value is stored in the variable. The intent of the third rule is to say that return values may be; released after they've been used.

Performance,"ointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there. Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations. If you look at the first indices in these GEP instructions you find that they; are different (0 and 1), therefore the address computation diverges with that; index. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: llvm. @MyVar = external global { [10 x i32] }; %idx1 = getelementp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:7047,load,load,7047,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"ointeraliasing>`_. * Provide a consistent method for computing addresses so that address; computations don't need to be a part of load and store instructions in the IR. * Support non-C-like languages, to the extent that it doesn't interfere with; other goals. * Minimize target-specific information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #.

Performance,"ol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``. Next the linker invokes the LLVM; optimizer and code generators using ``lto_codegen_compile()`` which returns a; native object file creating by merging the LLVM bitcode files and applying; various optimization passes. Phase 4 : Symbol Resolution after optimization; ----------------------------------------------. In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals.

Performance,"olution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms. We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own. For instance, `cat header.h header.h | gcc -fsyntax-only -xc++ -`.; This command concatenates `header.h` twice before compiling it to make sure; it has proper include protectors.; * Enable it in `rootcling` -- rootcling can produce a C++ Modules-aware; dictionary when it is invoked with `-cxxmodule` flag.; * Modularization of external dependencies -- if a header file is not explicitly; nominated as part of a module and it is transitively included in two mo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:14200,perform,performance,14200,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,2,"['load', 'perform']","['loads', 'performance']"

Performance,"oming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form. For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_. The question for this article is ""who places the phi nodes when lowering; assignments to mutable variables?"". The issue here is that LLVM; *requires* that its IR be in SSA form: there is no ""non-ssa"" mode for; it. However, SSA construction requires non-trivial algorithms and data; structures, so it is inconvenient and wasteful for every front-end to; have to reproduce this logic. Memory in LLVM; ==============. The 'trick' here is that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator.

Such conditional; code often follows a pattern:. .. code-block:: c++. float my_function(float a) {; if (__nvvm_reflect(""FASTMATH"")); return my_function_fast(a);; else; return my_function_precise(a);; }. The default value for all unspecified reflection parameters is zero. The ``NVVMReflect`` pass should be executed early in the optimization; pipeline, immediately after the link stage. The ``internalize`` pass is also; recommended to remove unused math functions from the resulting PTX. For an; input IR module ``module.bc``, the following compilation flow is recommended:. 1. Save list of external functions in ``module.bc``; 2. Link ``module.bc`` with ``libdevice.compute_XX.YY.bc``; 3. Internalize all functions not in list from (1); 4.

Performance,"ompile and run, but has not been; updated**. Welcome to Chapter 1 of the ""Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM"" tutorial. This; tutorial runs through the implementation of a JIT compiler using LLVM's; On-Request-Compilation (ORC) APIs. It begins with a simplified version of the; KaleidoscopeJIT class used in the; `Implementing a language with LLVM <LangImpl01.html>`_ tutorials and then; introduces new features like concurrent compilation, optimization, lazy; compilation and remote execution. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to LLVM's ORC JIT APIs, show how; these APIs interact with other parts of LLVM, and to teach you how to recombine; them to build a custom JIT that is suited to your use-case. The structure of the tutorial is:. - Chapter #1: Investigate the simple KaleidoscopeJIT class. This will; introduce some of the basic concepts of the ORC JIT APIs, including the; idea of an ORC *Layer*. - `Chapter #2 <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_: Extend the basic KaleidoscopeJIT by adding; a new layer that will optimize IR and generated code. - `Chapter #3 <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_: Further extend the JIT by adding a; Compile-On-Demand layer to lazily compile IR. - `Chapter #4 <BuildingAJIT4.html>`_: Improve the laziness of our JIT by; replacing the Compile-On-Demand layer with a custom layer that uses the ORC; Compile Callbacks API directly to defer IR-generation until functions are; called. - `Chapter #5 <BuildingAJIT5.html>`_: Add process isolation by JITing code into; a remote process with reduced privileges using the JIT Remote APIs. To provide input for our JIT we will use a lightly modified version of the; Kaleidoscope REPL from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a; language in LLVM tutorial"".

If present, this; line contains a call instruction. This models both direct and; number of samples. For example,. .. code-block:: console. 130: 7 foo:3 bar:2 baz:7. The above means that at relative line offset 130 there is a call; instruction that calls one of ``foo()``, ``bar()`` and ``baz()``,; with ``baz()`` being the relatively more frequently called target. As an example, consider a program with the call chain ``main -> foo -> bar``.; When built with optimizations enabled, the compiler may inline the; calls to ``bar`` and ``foo`` inside ``main``.

Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint. This prevents the optimizer; from performing unsound optimizations.; #. recording a mapping of live pointers (and the allocation they're; associated with) for each statepoint.

Performance,"on ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``Mem",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:11241,optimiz,optimized,11241,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

To prevent this conservative choice and use; at most 32 bits, compile your program with the; `-fopenmp-optimistic-collapse`. GPU devices support; ===================. Data-sharing modes; ------------------. Clang supports two data-sharing models for Cuda devices: `Generic` and `Cuda`; modes. The default mode is `Generic`. `Cuda` mode can give an additional; performance and can be activated using the `-fopenmp-cuda-mode` flag. In; `Generic` mode all local variables that can be shared in the parallel regions; are stored in the global memory. In `Cuda` mode local variables are not shared; between the threads and it is user responsibility to share the required data; between the threads in the parallel regions. Often, the optimizer is able to; reduce the cost of `Generic` mode to the level of `Cuda` mode, but the flag,; as well as other assumption flags, can be used for tuning. Features not supported or with limited support for Cuda devices; ---------------------------------------------------------------. - Cancellation constructs are not supported. - Doacross loop nest is not supported. - User-defined reductions are supported only for trivial types. - Nested parallelism: inner parallel regions are executed sequentially. - Debug information for OpenMP target regions is supported, but sometimes it may; be required to manually specify the address class of the inspected variables.; In some cases the local variables are actually allocated in the global memory,; but the debug info may be not aware of it. .. _OpenMP implementation details:.

On the other hand, any volume is a small world by itself - what we need; to do is to take it out and to ignore all the rest since it is a; self-contained object. In fact, the modeller can act like this,; considering a given volume as temporary MARS, but we will describe this; feature later on. Let us focus on the biggest pack - it is mandatory to; define one.

In CPython, the performance of `non-overloaded` function calls depends; greatly on the Python interpreter's internal specializations; and Python3; has many specializations specific to basic extension modules (C function; pointer calls), gaining a performance boost of more than 30% over Python2.; Only since Python3.8 is there also better support for closure objects (vector; calls) as cppyy uses, to short-cut through the interpreter's own overhead.

Performance,"on cost model is used to select the vector width. Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``. This is useful when compiling with ``-Os`` to; manually enable vectorization or interleaving. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop interleave(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. The vector width is specified by; ``vectorize_width(_value_[, fixed|scalable])``, where _value_ is a positive; integer and the type of vectorization can be specified with an optional; second parameter. The default for the second parameter is 'fixed' and; refers to fixed width vectorization, whereas 'scalable' indicates the; compiler should use scalable vectors instead. Another use of vectorize_width; is ``vectorize_width(fixed|scalable)`` where the user can hint at the type; of vectorization to use without specifying the exact width. In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors.

Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited.

Performance,"on is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language loop iterations are executing concurrently.

The LiveOut section of the StkMapRecord will be empty for a statepoint; record. Safepoint Semantics & Verification; ==================================. The fundamental correctness property for the compiled code's; correctness w.r.t. the garbage collector is a dynamic one. It must be; the case that there is no dynamic trace such that an operation; involving a potentially relocated pointer is observably-after a; safepoint which could relocate it. 'observably-after' is this usage; means that an outside observer could observe this sequence of events; in a way which precludes the operation being performed before the; safepoint. To understand why this 'observable-after' property is required,; consider a null comparison performed on the original copy of a; relocated pointer. Assuming that control flow follows the safepoint,; there is no way to observe externally whether the null comparison is; performed before or after the safepoint. (Remember, the original; Value is unmodified by the safepoint.) The compiler is free to make; either scheduling choice. The actual correctness property implemented is slightly stronger than; this. We require that there be no *static path* on which a; potentially relocated pointer is 'observably-after' it may have been; relocated. This is slightly stronger than is strictly necessary (and; thus may disallow some otherwise valid programs), but greatly; simplifies reasoning about correctness of the compiled code. By construction, this property will be upheld by the optimizer if; correctly established in the source IR. This is a key invariant of; the design. The existing IR Verifier pass has been extended to check most of the; local restrictions on the intrinsics mentioned in their respective; documentation.

Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery.

A literal ""``$``"" may be included by using ""``$$``"" in the template. To include; other special characters into the output, the usual ""``\XX``"" escapes may be; used, just as in other strings. Note that after template substitution, the; resulting assembly string is parsed by LLVM's integrated assembler unless it is; disabled -- even when emitting a ``.s`` file -- and thus must contain assembly; syntax known to LLVM. LLVM also supports a few more substitutions useful for writing inline assembly:. - ``${:uid}``: Expands to a decimal integer unique to this inline assembly blob.; This substitution is useful when declaring a local label. Many standard; compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may duplicate an inline asm blob.; Adding a blob-unique identifier ensures that the two labels will not conflict; during assembly. This is used to implement `GCC's %= special format; string <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html>`_.; - ``${:comment}``: Expands to the comment character of the current target's; assembly dialect.

Labels with; this prefix will not appear in the symbol table of the assembled object.; Typically the prefix is ``L``, but targets may use other strings. ``.L`` is; relatively popular.

If any FP operation in a function is constrained then they all must be; constrained. This is required for correct LLVM IR. Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument.

No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes.

Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage.

If the returned; value is not appropriately aligned at runtime, a poison value is returned; instead. The optional ``!noundef`` metadata must reference a single metadata name; ``<empty_node>`` corresponding to a node with no entries. The existence of; ``!noundef`` metadata on the instruction tells the optimizer that the value; loaded is known to be :ref:`well defined <welldefinedvalues>`.; If the value isn't well defined, the behavior is undefined. If the ``!noundef``; metadata is combined with poison-generating metadata like ``!nonnull``,; violation of that metadata constraint will also result in undefined behavior.

ROOT uses a compression algorithm based on the well-known `gzip`; algorithm. It supports nine levels of compression. The default for ROOT; is one. The compression level can be set with the method; `TFile::SetCompressionLevel`. The experience with this algorithm shows; that a compression level of 1.3 for raw data files and around two on; most DST files is the optimum. The choice of one for the default is a; compromise between the time it takes to read and write the object vs.; the disk space savings. To specify no compression, set the level to zero. We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. If the I/O operation is increased; by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it; may compress the data by a factor of 10. On the other hand if the time; spend on I/O is large, compression may have a large impact on the; program's performance. The compression factor, i.e. the savings of disk space, varies with the; type of data. A buffer with a same value array is compressed so that the; value is only written once. For example, a track has the mass of a pion; that it is always the same, and the charge of the pion that is either; positive or negative. For 1000 pions, the mass will be written only; once, and the charge only twice (positive and negative). When the data; is sparse, i.e. when there are many zeros, the compression factor is; also high. +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | Compression level | Bytes | Write Time (sec) | Read Time (sec.) |; +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | 0 | 1,004,998 | 4.77 | 0.07 |; +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | 1 | 438,366 | 6.67 | 0.05 |; +---------------------+------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:92391,perform,performance,92391,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"on-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow call. * DSE: Unordered stores can be DSE'ed like normal stores. Monotonic stores can; be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially; important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger; atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to; MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,; because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with; atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen; ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes.; On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like; ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()`` returns true. The MachineMemOperand for all atomic operations is currently marked as volatile;; this is not correct in the IR sense of volatile, but CodeGen handles anything; marked volatile very conservatively. This should get fixed at some point. One very important property of the atomic operations is that if your backend; supports any inline lock-free atomic operations of a given size, you should; support *ALL* operations of that size in a lock-free manner.

For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in. If we wanted to make a ""static Kaleidoscope compiler"", we would use; exactly the code we have now, except that we would defer running the; optimizer until the entire file has been parsed. In addition to the distinction between function and module passes, passes can be; divided into transform and analysis passes. Transform passes mutate the IR, and; analysis passes compute information that other passes can use. In order to add; a transform pass, all analysis passes it depends upon must be registered in; advance. In order to get per-function optimizations going, we need to set up a; `FunctionPassManager <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html#what-passmanager-doesr>`_ to hold; and organize the LLVM optimizations that we want to run. Once we have; that, we can add a set of optimizations to run. We'll need a new; FunctionPassManager for each module that we want to optimize, so we'll; add to a function created in the previous chapter (``InitializeModule()``):. .. code-block:: c++. void InitializeModuleAndManagers(void) {; // Open a new context and module.; TheContext = std::make_unique<LLVMC",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst:4771,optimiz,optimizer,4771,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizer']

The LiveOut section of the StkMapRecord will be empty for a statepoint; record. Safepoint Semantics & Verification; ==================================. The fundamental correctness property for the compiled code's; correctness w.r.t. the garbage collector is a dynamic one. It must be; the case that there is no dynamic trace such that an operation; involving a potentially relocated pointer is observably-after a; safepoint which could relocate it. 'observably-after' is this usage; means that an outside observer could observe this sequence of events; in a way which precludes the operation being performed before the; safepoint. To understand why this 'observable-after' property is required,; consider a null comparison performed on the original copy of a; relocated pointer. Assuming that control flow follows the safepoint,; there is no way to observe externally whether the null comparison is; performed before or after the safepoint. (Remember, the original; Value is unmodified by the safepoint.) The compiler is free to make; either scheduling choice. The actual correctness property implemented is slightly stronger than; this. We require that there be no *static path* on which a; potentially relocated pointer is 'observably-after' it may have been; relocated. This is slightly stronger than is strictly necessary (and; thus may disallow some otherwise valid programs), but greatly; simplifies reasoning about correctness of the compiled code. By construction, this property will be upheld by the optimizer if; correctly established in the source IR. This is a key invariant of; the design.

Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions.

This protection is *near-precise*, i.e. it guarantees that the control flow will; be transferred to one of the valid return addresses for this function,; but not necessary to the point of the most recent `CALL`. General case; ------------; For functions called multiple times a *return jump table* is constructed; in the same manner as jump tables for indirect function calls (see above).; The correct jump table entry (or its index) is passed by `CALL` to `f()`; (as an extra argument) and then spilled to stack.; The `RET` instruction is replaced with a load of the jump table entry,; jump table range check, and `JMP` to the jump table entry.

If a function is called indirectly, the return jump table is constructed for the; equivalence class of functions instead of a single function.

Performance,"ons cannot overlap. Also, overlapping regions; cannot have the same name. There is no support for marking regions from high-level source code, like C or; C++. As a workaround, inline assembly directives may be used:. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int a, int b) {; __asm volatile(""# LLVM-MCA-BEGIN foo"":::""memory"");; a += 42;; __asm volatile(""# LLVM-MCA-END"":::""memory"");; a *= b;; return a;; }. However, this interferes with optimizations like loop vectorization and may have; an impact on the code generated. This is because the ``__asm`` statements are; seen as real code having important side effects, which limits how the code; around them can be transformed. If users want to make use of inline assembly; to emit markers, then the recommendation is to always verify that the output; assembly is equivalent to the assembly generated in the absence of markers.; The `Clang options to emit optimization reports <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#options-to-emit-optimization-reports>`_; can also help in detecting missed optimizations.

This is; important for calls to attributed function pointers, where there is no; definition or declaration available. 2. Handling PSTATE.SM; =====================. When changing PSTATE.SM the execution of FP/vector operations may be transferred; to another processing element. This has three important implications:. * The runtime SVE vector length may change. * The contents of FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers are zeroed. * The set of allowable instructions changes. This leads to certain restrictions on IR and optimizations. For example, it; is undefined behaviour to share vector-length dependent state between functions; that may operate with different values for PSTATE.SM. Front-ends must honour; these restrictions when generating LLVM IR. Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not. If we let the compiler insert the appropriate ``smstart``; and ``smstop`` instructions around call boundaries, then the effects on SVE; state can be mitigated. By limiting the state changes to a very brief window; around the call we can control how the operations are scheduled and how live; values remain preserved between state transitions. In order to control PSTATE.SM at this level of granularity, we use function and; callsite attributes rather than intrinsics.

Performance,"ons; ===========. Marking Functions as Kernels; ----------------------------. In PTX, there are two types of functions: *device functions*, which are only; callable by device code, and *kernel functions*, which are callable by host; code. By default, the back-end will emit device functions. Metadata is used to; declare a function as a kernel function. This metadata is attached to the; ``nvvm.annotations`` named metadata object, and has the following format:. .. code-block:: text. !0 = !{<function-ref>, metadata !""kernel"", i32 1}. The first parameter is a reference to the kernel function. The following; example shows a kernel function calling a device function in LLVM IR. The; function ``@my_kernel`` is callable from host code, but ``@my_fmad`` is not. .. code-block:: llvm. define float @my_fmad(float %x, float %y, float %z) {; %mul = fmul float %x, %y; %add = fadd float %mul, %z; ret float %add; }. define void @my_kernel(float* %ptr) {; %val = load float, float* %ptr; %ret = call float @my_fmad(float %val, float %val, float %val); store float %ret, float* %ptr; ret void; }. !nvvm.annotations = !{!1}; !1 = !{void (float*)* @my_kernel, !""kernel"", i32 1}. When compiled, the PTX kernel functions are callable by host-side code. .. _address_spaces:. Address Spaces; --------------. The NVPTX back-end uses the following address space mapping:. ============= ======================; Address Space Memory Space; ============= ======================; 0 Generic; 1 Global; 2 Internal Use; 3 Shared; 4 Constant; 5 Local; ============= ======================. Every global variable and pointer type is assigned to one of these address; spaces, with 0 being the default address space. Intrinsics are provided which; can be used to convert pointers between the generic and non-generic address; spaces. As an example, the following IR will define an array ``@g`` that resides in; global device memory. .. code-block:: llvm. @g = internal addrspace(1) global [4 x i32] [ i32 0, i32 1, i32 2, i32 3",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NVPTXUsage.rst:1690,load,load,1690,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NVPTXUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NVPTXUsage.rst,1,['load'],['load']

A given geometry can be built in various ways, but one has to follow; some mandatory steps. Even if we might use some terms that will be; explained later, here are few general rules:. - Volumes need media and shapes in order to be created.; - Both containers and contained volumes must be created before linking; them together, and the relative transformation matrix must be; provided.; - Any volume have to be positioned somewhere otherwise it will not be; considered as part of the geometry.; - Visibility or tracking properties of volumes can be provided both at; build time or after geometry is closed, but global visualization; settings (see section: ""The Drawing Package"") should not be provided; at build time, otherwise the drawing package will be loaded. There is also a list of specific rules:. - Positioned volumes should not extrude their container or intersect; with others within this unless it is specified (see section:; Overlapping Volumes).; - The top volume (containing all geometry trees) must be specified; before closing the geometry and must not be positioned - it; represents the global reference frame.; - After building the full geometry tree, the geometry must be closed; (see the method **`TGeoManager::CloseGeometry()`**). Voxelization; can be redone per volume after this process. The list is much bigger and we will describe in more detail the geometry; creation procedure in the following sections.

This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks. [Most](https://lwn.net/Articles/743265/); [discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information. While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges.

In Clang's AST file format, deserializing a declaration that is a; ``DeclContext`` is a separate operation from deserializing all of the; declarations stored within that declaration context. Therefore, Clang will; deserialize the translation unit declaration without deserializing the; declarations within that translation unit. When required, the declarations; stored within a declaration context will be deserialized. There are two; representations of the declarations within a declaration context, which; correspond to the name-lookup and iteration behavior described above:. * When the front end performs name lookup to find a name ``x`` within a given; declaration context (for example, during semantic analysis of the expression; ``p->x``, where ``p``'s type is defined in the precompiled header), Clang; refers to an on-disk hash table that maps from the names within that; declaration context to the declaration IDs that represent each visible; declaration with that name. The actual declarations will then be; deserialized to provide the results of name lookup.; * When the front end performs iteration over all of the declarations within a; declaration context, all of those declarations are immediately; de-serialized.

Performance,"op attributes, a new ``MDNode``; must be created and assigned as the new ``llvm.loop`` metadata. Any; connection between the old ``MDNode`` and the loop is lost. The; ``llvm.loop`` node is also used as LoopID (``Loop::getLoopID()``), i.e.; the loop effectively gets a new identifier. For instance,; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` references the LoopID. Therefore, if; the parallel access property is to be preserved after adding/removing; loop attributes, any ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` reference must be; updated to the new LoopID. Transformation Metadata Structure; =================================. Some attributes describe code transformations (unrolling, vectorizing,; loop distribution, etc.). They can either be a hint to the optimizer; that a transformation might be beneficial, instruction to use a specific; option, , or convey a specific request from the user (such as; ``#pragma clang loop`` or ``#pragma omp simd``). If a transformation is forced but cannot be carried-out for any reason,; an optimization-missed warning must be emitted. Semantic information; such as a transformation being safe (e.g.; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``) can be unused by the optimizer; without generating a warning. Unless explicitly disabled, any optimization pass may heuristically; determine whether a transformation is beneficial and apply it. If; metadata for another transformation was specified, applying a different; transformation before it might be inadvertent due to being applied on a; different loop or the loop not existing anymore. To avoid having to; explicitly disable an unknown number of passes, the attribute; ``llvm.loop.disable_nonforced`` disables all optional, high-level,; restructuring transformations. The following example avoids the loop being altered before being; vectorized, for instance being unrolled. .. code-block:: llvm. br i1 %exitcond, label %for.exit, label %for.header, !llvm.loop !0; ...; !0 = distinct !{!0, !1, !2}; !1 = !{!""llvm.loop.vectorize.enab",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TransformMetadata.rst:2563,optimiz,optimization-missed,2563,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TransformMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TransformMetadata.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization-missed']

The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer. It takes; LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or analyses on it,; and then outputs the optimized file. The optimizations available via; :program:`opt` depend upon what libraries were linked into it as well as any; additional libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-load` option. Use; the :option:`-help` option to determine what optimizations you can use. If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is ""``-``"", :program:`opt`; reads its input from standard input. Inputs can be in either the LLVM assembly; language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``). If an output filename is not specified with the :option:`-o` option,; :program:`opt` writes its output to the standard output. OPTIONS; -------. .. option:: -f. Enable binary output on terminals. Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse to; write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal. With this option,; :program:`opt` will write raw bitcode regardless of the output device. .. option:: -help. Print a summary of command line options. .. option:: -o <filename>. Specify the output filename. .. option:: -S. Write output in LLVM intermediate language (instead of bitcode). .. option:: -{passname}. :program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or; analysis passes in any order. The :option:`-help` option lists all the passes; available. The order in which the options occur on the command line are the; order in which they are executed (within pass constraints). .. option:: -strip-debug.

It receives as input a cxx_loop_proto which it then converts into a; string of valid LLVM IR: a function with either a single loop or two nested; loops. It then creates a new string of IR by running optimization passes over; the original IR. Currently, it only runs a loop-vectorize pass but more passes; can easily be added to the fuzzer. Once there are two versions of the input; function (optimized and not), llvm-proto-fuzzer uses LLVM's JIT Engine to; compile both functions. Lastly, it runs both functions on a suite of inputs and; checks that both functions behave the same on all inputs. In this way,; llvm-proto-fuzzer can find not only compiler crashes, but also miscompiles; originating from LLVM's optimization passes. llvm-proto-fuzzer is built very similarly to clang-proto-fuzzer.

It is illegal for the list node to be empty since it might be confused; with an access group. The access group metadata node must be 'distinct' to avoid collapsing; multiple access groups by content. An access group metadata node must; always be empty which can be used to distinguish an access group; metadata node from a list of access groups.

Chained precompiled headers were initially intended to improve the performance; of IDE-centric operations such as syntax highlighting and code completion while; a particular source file is being edited by the user. To minimize the amount; of reparsing required after a change to the file, a form of precompiled header; --- called a precompiled *preamble* --- is automatically generated by parsing; all of the headers in the source file, up to and including the last; ``#include``. When only the source file changes (and none of the headers it; depends on), reparsing of that source file can use the precompiled preamble and; start parsing after the ``#include``\ s, so parsing time is proportional to the; size of the source file (rather than all of its includes). However, the; compilation of that translation unit may already use a precompiled header: in; this case, Clang will create the precompiled preamble as a chained precompiled; header that refers to the original precompiled header. This drastically; reduces the time needed to serialize the precompiled preamble for use in; reparsing.

A fixed point number represents a real data type for a number that has a fixed; number of digits after a radix point (equivalent to the decimal point '.').; The number of digits after the radix point is referred as the `scale`.

The; following intrinsics perform fixed point arithmetic operations on 2 operands; of the same scale, specified as the third argument.

Instruction Scheduling; ----------------------. A number of passes can reschedule instructions, notably instruction selection; and the pre-and-post RA machine schedulers. Instruction scheduling can; significantly change the nature of the program -- in the (very unlikely) worst; case the instruction sequence could be completely reversed. In such; circumstances LLVM follows the principle applied to optimizations, that it is; better for the debugger not to display any state than a misleading state.; Thus, whenever instructions are advanced in order of execution, any; corresponding DBG_VALUE is kept in its original position, and if an instruction; is delayed then the variable is given an undefined location for the duration; of the delay. To illustrate, consider this pseudo-MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6.

Performance,"orks by; speculatively storing over the return address after a bounds check bypass. This; speculative store then ends up being used by the CPU during speculative; execution of the return, potentially directing speculative execution to; arbitrary gadgets in the binary. Let's look at an example.; ```; unsigned char local_buffer[4];; unsigned char *untrusted_data_from_caller = ...;; unsigned long untrusted_size_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_size_from_caller < sizeof(local_buffer)) {; // Speculative execution enters here with a too-large size.; memcpy(local_buffer, untrusted_data_from_caller,; untrusted_size_from_caller);; // The stack has now been smashed, writing an attacker-controlled; // address over the return address.; minor_processing(local_buffer);; return;; // Control will speculate to the attacker-written address.; }; ```. However, this can be mitigated by hardening the load of the return address just; like any other load. This is sometimes complicated because x86 for example; *implicitly* loads the return address off the stack. However, the; implementation technique below is specifically designed to mitigate this; implicit load by using the stack pointer to communicate misspeculation between; functions. This additionally causes a misspeculation to have an invalid stack; pointer and never be able to read the speculatively stored return address. See; the detailed discussion below. For variant #1.2, the attacker speculatively stores into the vtable or jump; table used to implement an indirect call or indirect jump. Because this is; speculative, this will often be possible even when these are stored in; read-only pages. For example:; ```; class FancyObject : public BaseObject {; public:; void DoSomething() override;; };; void f(unsigned long attacker_offset, unsigned long attacker_data) {; FancyObject object = getMyObject();; unsigned long *arr[4] = getFourDataPointers();; if (attacker_offset < 4) {; // We have bypassed the bounds check speculatively.; unsign",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:12328,load,loads,12328,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']

A.h,; potentially only part of the descriptor of libA, expands to more than 26000; lines of code. ```cpp; // Main.cpp; #include ""A.h""; int main() {; do();; return 0;; }. ```; Main.cpp, reuses code from libA by including libA's descriptor and links against; libA. The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA.

The ``strictfp`` and ``denormal-fp-math`` attributes as; well as :ref:`Constrained Floating-Point Intrinsics <constrainedfp>` can be used; to weaken LLVM's assumptions and ensure defined behavior in non-default; floating-point environments; see their respective documentation for details. .. _floatnan:. Behavior of Floating-Point NaN values; -------------------------------------. A floating-point NaN value consists of a sign bit, a quiet/signaling bit, and a; payload (which makes up the rest of the mantissa except for the quiet/signaling; bit). LLVM assumes that the quiet/signaling bit being set to ``1`` indicates a; quiet NaN (QNaN), and a value of ``0`` indicates a signaling NaN (SNaN). In the; following we will hence just call it the ""quiet bit"". The representation bits of a floating-point value do not mutate arbitrarily; in; particular, if there is no floating-point operation being performed, NaN signs,; quiet bits, and payloads are preserved. For the purpose of this section, ``bitcast`` as well as the following operations; are not ""floating-point math operations"": ``fneg``, ``llvm.fabs``, and; ``llvm.copysign``. These operations act directly on the underlying bit; representation and never change anything except possibly for the sign bit. For floating-point math operations, unless specified otherwise, the following; rules apply when a NaN value is returned: the result has a non-deterministic; sign; the quiet bit and payload are non-deterministically chosen from the; following set of options:. - The quiet bit is set and the payload is all-zero. (""Preferred NaN"" case); - The quiet bit is set and the payload is copied from any input operand that is; a NaN. (""Quieting NaN propagation"" case); - The quiet bit and payload are copied from any input operand that is a NaN.; (""Unchanged NaN propagation"" case); - The quiet bit is set an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:158218,perform,performed,158218,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['perform'],['performed']

However, it compares very favorably with previously recommended; approaches such as the `lfence` instruction. Just as users can restrict the; scope of `lfence` to control its performance impact, this mitigation technique; could be restricted in scope as well. However, it is important to understand what it would cost to get a fully; mitigated baseline. Here we assume targeting a Haswell (or newer) processor and; using all of the tricks to improve performance (so leaves the low 2gb; unprotected and +/- 2gb surrounding any PC in the program). We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers. We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

A compiler can perform loop optimizations that result in the generated code; executing multiple iterations concurrently.

Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads.

Note: The method `TGeoManager::FindNextBoundary()` does not modify the; current point/direction nor the current volume/state. The returned node; is the next crossed one, but the physical path (state) AFTER crossing; the boundary is not determined. In order to find out this new state, one; has to propagate the point with a distance slightly bigger that the; computed step value (which is accurate within numerical precision).

The method; returns a pointer to the *deepest node* that geometrically contains *P*; (in our case let us suppose it is *B\_3*). Since a node is just a; positioned volume, we can then get a pointer to the volume, medium or; material objects related to it. *Deepest* means that *B\_3* still; contains point *P* (as well as *A\_1* and *TOP\_1*), but none of the; daughters of volume **B** does. After finding out the node containing; the particle, one can check if the geometry state is different compared; to the last located point:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t *TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(); ```. The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is; presented in the figure 17-36. It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the; answer. This optimizes the search when continuously tracking a particle.; The main actions performed are:. - moving up and down in the logical node tree while updating the; current node and its global matrix; - converting the global position into the local frame of the current; node/volume; - checking whether the local position lies within the geometrical; shape of the current volume - if this is the case continue the; search downwards for the daughters of the current node, otherwise; search upwards its containers until the top level is reached.; - the number of candidate nodes to be checked at a given level is; minimized by an additional optimization structure: voxels.

Are the headers C, C++,; Objective-C++, or one of the variants of these languages? What; declarations in those headers are actually meant to be part of the; API, and what declarations are present only because they had to be; written as part of the header file?. Semantic import; ---------------; Modules improve access to the API of software libraries by replacing the textual preprocessor inclusion model with a more robust, more efficient semantic model. From the user's perspective, the code looks only slightly different, because one uses an ``import`` declaration rather than a ``#include`` preprocessor directive:. .. code-block:: c. import std.io; // pseudo-code; see below for syntax discussion. However, this module import behaves quite differently from the corresponding ``#include <stdio.h>``: when the compiler sees the module import above, it loads a binary representation of the ``std.io`` module and makes its API available to the application directly. Preprocessor definitions that precede the import declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_; This semantic import model addresses many of the problems of the preprocessor inclusion model:. * **Compile-time scalability**: The ``std.io`` module is only compiled once, and importing the module into a translation unit is a constant-time operation (independent of module system). Thus, the API of each software library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an *M + N* problem. * **Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a consistent preprocessor environment. This completely eliminates the need for ``__",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:4429,load,loads,4429,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

One more remark at this point: as every command you type into ROOT is; usually interpreted by Cling, an ""escape character"" is needed to pass; commands to ROOT directly. This character is the dot at the beginning of; a line:. ``` {.cpp}; root [1] .<command>; ```. This is a selection of the most common commands. - **quit root**, simply type `.q` or `.quit` or `.exit`. - obtain the full **list of commands**, use `.?` or `.help`. - **access the shell** of the operating system, type `.!<OS_command>`;; try, e.g. `.!ls` or `.!pwd`. - **execute a macro**, enter `.x <file_name>`; in the above example,; you might have used `.x slits.C` at the ROOT prompt. - **load a macro**, type `.L <file_name>`; in the above example, you; might instead have used the command `.L slits.C` followed by the; function call `slits();`. Note that after loading a macro all; functions and procedures defined therein are available at the ROOT; prompt. - **compile a macro**, type `.L <file_name>+`; ROOT is able to manage; for you the `C++` compiler behind the scenes and to produce machine; code starting from your macro. One could decide to compile a macro; in order to obtain better performance or to get nearer to the; production environment. ## Plotting Measurements ##. To display measurements in ROOT, including errors, there exists a; powerful class `TGraphErrors` with different types of constructors. In; the example here, we use data from the file `ExampleData.txt` in text; format:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0] TGraphErrors gr(""ExampleData.txt"");; root [1] gr.Draw(""AP"");; ```. You should see the output shown in Figure [2.2](#f22).

Performance,"ot naturally encode a needed element type. This is also; used for inline assembly. Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------. Frontends need to be adjusted to track pointee types independently of LLVM,; insofar as they are necessary for lowering. For example, clang now tracks the; pointee type in the ``Address`` structure. Frontends using the C API through an FFI interface should be aware that a; number of C API functions are deprecated and will be removed as part of the; opaque pointer transition::.

Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution. The; guarantees in terms of synchronization are very weak, so make sure these are; only used in a pattern which you know is correct. Generally, these would; either be used for atomic operations which do not protect other memory (like; an atomic counter), or along with a ``fence``. Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this can be treated as a read+write on the relevant; memory location (and alias analysis will take advantage of that). In addition,; it is legal to reorder non-atomic and Unordered loads around Monotonic; loads. CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic; operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those; optimizations useful.

To delete the object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; ```. You should see the print out from its destructor. Setting the pointer; to zero afterwards is not strictly necessary (and Cling does it; automatically), but the object is no more accessible, and any attempt; to use the pointer again will, as has already been stated, cause; grief. So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In; C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost; compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly; futile to do something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; ```. Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you; will not see the destructor message. As explained in the Script; lesson, you can load in compound statements, which would be a bit; pointless if everything disappeared as soon as it was loaded! Instead,; to reset the stack you have to type:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```. This sends the Reset message via the global pointer to the ROOT; object, which, amongst its many roles, acts as a resource manager.; Start ROOT again and type in the following:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(4.,5.,-6.);; root[] gROOT->Reset();; ```. You will see that this deletes the first object but not the second. We; have also painted ourselves into a corner, as `my_objptr` was also on; the stack. This command will fail. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Cling no longer knows what `my_objptr` is.

Performance,"ou are done using the LLVM APIs, you should call ``llvm_shutdown()`` to; deallocate memory used for internal structures. .. _managedstatic:. Lazy Initialization with ``ManagedStatic``; ------------------------------------------. ``ManagedStatic`` is a utility class in LLVM used to implement static; initialization of static resources, such as the global type tables. In a; single-threaded environment, it implements a simple lazy initialization scheme.; When LLVM is compiled with support for multi-threading, however, it uses; double-checked locking to implement thread-safe lazy initialization. .. _llvmcontext:. Achieving Isolation with ``LLVMContext``; ----------------------------------------. ``LLVMContext`` is an opaque class in the LLVM API which clients can use to; operate multiple, isolated instances of LLVM concurrently within the same; address space. For instance, in a hypothetical compile-server, the compilation; of an individual translation unit is conceptually independent from all the; others, and it would be desirable to be able to compile incoming translation; units concurrently on independent server threads. Fortunately, ``LLVMContext``; exists to enable just this kind of scenario!. Conceptually, ``LLVMContext`` provides isolation. Every LLVM entity; (``Module``\ s, ``Value``\ s, ``Type``\ s, ``Constant``\ s, etc.) in LLVM's; in-memory IR belongs to an ``LLVMContext``. Entities in different contexts; *cannot* interact with each other: ``Module``\ s in different contexts cannot be; linked together, ``Function``\ s cannot be added to ``Module``\ s in different; contexts, etc. What this means is that is safe to compile on multiple; threads simultaneously, as long as no two threads operate on entities within the; same context. In practice, very few places in the API require the explicit specification of a; ``LLVMContext``, other than the ``Type`` creation/lookup APIs. Because every; ``Type`` carries a reference to its owning context, most other entities can; de",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:122978,concurren,concurrently,122978,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['concurren'],['concurrently']

Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger.

Annotated assembly display will supply contextual markup to help clients more; efficiently implement things like pretty printers. Most markup will be target; independent, so clients can effectively provide good display without any target; specific knowledge. Annotated assembly goes through the normal instruction printer, but optionally; includes contextual tags on portions of the instruction string. An annotation; is any '<' '>' delimited section of text(1). .. code-block:: bat. annotation: '<' tag-name tag-modifier-list ':' annotated-text '>'; tag-name: identifier; tag-modifier-list: comma delimited identifier list. The tag-name is an identifier which gives the type of the annotation. For the; first pass, this will be very simple, with memory references, registers, and; immediates having the tag names ""mem"", ""reg"", and ""imm"", respectively. The tag-modifier-list is typically additional target-specific context, such as; register class. Clients should accept and ignore any tag-names or tag-modifiers they do not; understand, allowing the annotations to grow in richness without breaking older; clients. For example, a possible annotation of an ARM load of a stack-relative location; might be annotated as:. .. code-block:: text. ldr <reg gpr:r0>, <mem regoffset:[<reg gpr:sp>, <imm:#4>]>. 1: For assembly dialects in which '<' and/or '>' are legal tokens, a literal token is escaped by following immediately with a repeat of the character. For example, a literal '<' character is output as '<<' in an annotated assembly string. C API Details; -------------. The intended consumers of this information use the C API, therefore the new C; API function for the disassembler will be added to provide an option to produce; disassembled instructions with annotations, ``LLVMSetDisasmOptions()`` and the; ``LLVMDisassembler_Option_UseMarkup`` option (see above).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:2646,load,load,2646,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MarkedUpDisassembly.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MarkedUpDisassembly.rst,1,['load'],['load']

Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count. Using this information, ``ConstraintElimination`` is able; to determine ``p + count`` doesn’t wrap.; * Accordingly, ``p + i`` and ``p + i + 1`` also don’t wrap.; * Therefore, ``p <= p + i`` and ``p + i + 1 <= p + count``.; * The if-condition simplifies to false and becomes dead code that the subsequent; optimization passes can remove. ``OptRemarks`` can be utilized to provide insights into performance tuning.

Internal bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Internal bounds annotations change a pointer into a wide pointer. The debugger; needs to understand that wide pointers are essentially pointers with a struct; layout. To handle this, a wide pointer is described as a record type in the; debug info. The type name has a special name prefix (e.g.,; ``__bounds_safety$bidi_indexable``) which can be recognized by a debug info; consumer to provide support that goes beyond showing the internal structure of; the wide pointer. There are no DWARF extensions needed to support wide pointers.; In our implementation, LLDB recognizes wide pointer types by name and; reconstructs them as wide pointer Clang AST types for use in the expression; evaluator.

If all memory-accessing instructions in a loop have; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata that each refer to one of the access; groups of a loop's ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the; loop has no loop carried memory dependences and is considered to be a; parallel loop. Note that if not all memory access instructions belong to an access; group referred to by ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``, then the loop must; not be considered trivially parallel.

If the bit vector is all ones, the bit vector check is redundant; we simply; need to check that the address is in range and well aligned. This is more; likely to occur if the virtual tables are padded. Forward-Edge CFI for Virtual Calls by Interleaving Virtual Tables; -----------------------------------------------------------------. Dimitar et. al. proposed a novel approach that interleaves virtual tables in [1]_.; This approach is more efficient in terms of space because padding and bit vectors are no longer needed.; At the same time, it is also more efficient in terms of performance because in the interleaved layout; address points of the virtual tables are consecutive, thus the validity check of a virtual; vtable pointer is always a range check. At a high level, the interleaving scheme consists of three steps: 1) split virtual table groups into; separate virtual tables, 2) order virtual tables by a pre-order traversal of the class hierarchy; and 3) interleave virtual tables. The interleaving scheme implemented in LLVM is inspired by [1]_ but has its own; enhancements (more in `Interleave virtual tables`_). ..

Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached. The analysis manager only provides analysis results for the same IR type as; what the pass runs on. For example, a function pass receives an analysis; manager that only provides function-level analyses. This works for many; passes which work on a fixed scope. However, some passes want to peek up or; down the IR hierarchy. For example, an SCC pass may want to look at function; analyses for the functions inside the SCC. Or it may want to look at some; immutable global analysis. In these cases, the analysis manager can provide a; proxy to an outer or inner level analysis manager. For example, to get a; ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` from a ``CGSCCAnalysisManager``, you can call. .. code-block:: c++. FunctionAnalysisManager &FAM =; AM.getResult<FunctionAnalysisManagerCGSCCProxy>(InitialC, CG); .getManager();. and use ``FAM`` as a typical ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` that a function pass; would have access to.

Repaired the behavior of TTreeCache when the TTree has a dramatic dynamic range with a lots of very small entriesat the beginning and very large entries at the end, the size in bytes of the cluster for the later entries will be very large (because of the cluster size in entries is large!). TTreeCache::FillBuffer was always attempting to load complete clusters not matter the; size (even with the size was larger than 2GB!). This patch resolves the issue by limiting the amount of memory used to:. The requested size if more than one cluster fits in the cache.; Twice the requested size if at least one basket per branch fits in the cache.; Four time the requested size in the case where the cache can not even hold one basket per branch. The filling will restart at the next cluster boundary in the case a) and will; restart at the maximum of entry number read in the cache in the case b) and c).; Baskets that are below this boundary and did not fit in the cache will be read; individually.; Repaired the basket flushing frequency when the TTree has already more than one cluster size.; Repaired binning of string histogram generated by TTree::Draw.; Many bug fixes and fix for issues discovery by Coverity, see change log for more details.; In TTree::MakeProxy add proper support for top level stl collection of objects and for stl collection of objects that are 'empty' in the file (and thus we know nothing about its content).; Avoid deficiency in hadd when the resulting TTree is longer than the AutoSave length *and* the TFileMerger needs to handle the input files in more than one pass for example when there is more than 1000 input files or the -n option is passed to hadd.; Fix support for emulated class that derived from an abstract class.; This can happen when reading a file containing an ancient; class layout where the derived class is no longer provided in the; compiled code but the abstract base class is still provided.

The clang build system refers to builds as stages. A stage1 build is a standard; build using the compiler installed on the host, and a stage2 build is built; using the stage1 compiler. This nomenclature holds up to more stages too. In; general a stage*n* build is built using the output from stage*n-1*. Apple Clang Builds (A More Complex Bootstrap); =============================================. Apple's Clang builds are a slightly more complicated example of the simple; bootstrapping scenario. Apple Clang is built using a 2-stage build. The stage1 compiler is a host-only compiler with some options set. The stage1; compiler is a balance of optimization vs build time because it is a throwaway.; The stage2 compiler is the fully optimized compiler intended to ship to users. Setting up these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations.

OpenCL Specific Options; -----------------------. In addition to the options described in :doc:`UsersManual` there are the; following options specific to the OpenCL frontend. All the options in this section are frontend-only and therefore if used; with regular clang driver they require frontend forwarding, e.g. ``-cc1``; or ``-Xclang``. .. _opencl_finclude_default_header:. .. option:: -finclude-default-header. Adds most of builtin types and function declarations during compilations. By; default the OpenCL headers are not loaded by the frontend and therefore certain; builtin types and most of builtin functions are not declared. To load them; automatically this flag can be passed to the frontend (see also :ref:`the; section on the OpenCL Header <opencl_header>`):. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -Xclang -finclude-default-header test.cl. Alternatively the internal header `opencl-c.h` containing the declarations; can be included manually using ``-include`` or ``-I`` followed by the path; to the header location. The header can be found in the clang source tree or; installation directory. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -I<path to clang sources>/lib/Headers/opencl-c.h test.cl; $ clang -I<path to clang installation>/lib/clang/<llvm version>/include/opencl-c.h/opencl-c.h test.cl. In this example it is assumed that the kernel code contains; ``#include <opencl-c.h>`` just as a regular C include. Because the header is very large and long to parse, PCH (:doc:`PCHInternals`); and modules (:doc:`Modules`) can be used internally to improve the compilation; speed.

Compared with the; **`TMinuit`** class, which is a direct conversion from FORTRAN to C++,; `Minuit2` is a complete redesign and re-implementation of the package.; This new version provides all the functionality present in the old; FORTRAN version, with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and; computational performances.; Furthermore, it contains some fixes and small improvements and this new functionality:; * The possibility to set single side parameter limits; * the FUMILI algorithm (see the next paragraph ""FUMILI Minimization Package""),; which is an optimized method for least square and log; likelihood minimizations.

More information can be found; on the [MINUIT Web Site](MINUIT Web Site) and in particular at the; following documentation page at; <http://www.cern.ch/minuit/doc/doc.html>. A detailed User Guide for Minuit2 exists, describing the API of the internal classes.; ROOT uses `Minuit2` for fitting via the `Minuit2Minimizer` class which implements; the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface. `Minuit2` is also distributed as an independent package of ROOT and can be built; without any other dependency on the ROOT libraries. Examples on how to use the `Minuit2` and `Fumili2` plug-ins are provided; in the tutorials' directory `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/fit`:; `minuit2FitBench.C`, `minuit2FitBench2D.C` and `minuit2GausFit.C`.; More information on the classes and functions ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:65282,optimiz,optimized,65282,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"pendent access is made to populate `value2`. ## High Level Mitigation Approach. While several approaches are being actively pursued to mitigate specific; branches and/or loads inside especially risky software (most notably various OS; kernels), these approaches require manual and/or static analysis aided auditing; of code and explicit source changes to apply the mitigation. They are unlikely; to scale well to large applications. We are proposing a comprehensive; mitigation approach that would apply automatically across an entire program; rather than through manual changes to the code. While this is likely to have a; high performance cost, some applications may be in a good position to take this; performance / security tradeoff. The specific technique we propose is to cause loads to be checked using; branchless code to ensure that they are executing along a valid control flow; path. Consider the following C-pseudo-code representing the core idea of a; predicate guarding potentially invalid loads:; ```; void leak(int data);; void example(int* pointer1, int* pointer2) {; if (condition) {; // ... lots of code ...; leak(*pointer1);; } else {; // ... more code ...; leak(*pointer2);; }; }; ```. This would get transformed into something resembling the following:; ```; uintptr_t all_ones_mask = std::numerical_limits<uintptr_t>::max();; uintptr_t all_zeros_mask = 0;; void leak(int data);; void example(int* pointer1, int* pointer2) {; uintptr_t predicate_state = all_ones_mask;; if (condition) {; // Assuming ?: is implemented using branchless logic...; predicate_state = !condition ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... lots of code ...; //; // Harden the pointer so it can't be loaded; pointer1 &= predicate_state;; leak(*pointer1);; } else {; predicate_state = condition ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... more code ...; //; // Alternative: Harden the loaded value; int value2 = *pointer2 & predicate_state;; leak(value2);; }; }; ```.

Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general.

Performance,"perform loads and stores to; different address spaces via the x86 segment registers. A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed.

These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option.

If we envision modules as a cache to speed up compilation, then - as with other caching techniques -; it is important to keep cache consistency.; So **currently** Clang will do very strict check for consistency. Options consistency; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The language option of module units and their non-module-unit users should be consistent.; The following example is not allowed:. .. code-block:: c++. // M.cppm; export module M;. // Use.cpp; import M;. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 M.cppm --precompile -o M.pcm; $ clang++ -std=c++23 Use.cpp -fprebuilt-module-path=. The compiler would reject the example due to the inconsistent language options.; Not all options are language options.; For example, the following example is allowed:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 M.cppm --precompile -o M.pcm; # Inconsistent optimization level.; $ clang++ -std=c++20 -O3 Use.cpp -fprebuilt-module-path=.; # Inconsistent debugging level.; $ clang++ -std=c++20 -g Use.cpp -fprebuilt-module-path=. Although the two examples have inconsistent optimization and debugging level, both of them are accepted. Note that **currently** the compiler doesn't consider inconsistent macro definition a problem. For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -std=c++20 M.cppm --precompile -o M.pcm; # Inconsistent optimization level.; $ clang++ -std=c++20 -O3 -DNDEBUG Use.cpp -fprebuilt-module-path=.

Performance,"ple of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries.

Performance,"ple, the linker recognizes that ``foo2()`` is an externally; visible symbol defined in LLVM bitcode file. The linker completes its usual; symbol resolution pass and finds that ``foo2()`` is not used; anywhere. This information is used by the LLVM optimizer and it; removes ``foo2()``. * As soon as ``foo2()`` is removed, the optimizer recognizes that condition ``i; < 0`` is always false, which means ``foo3()`` is never used. Hence, the; optimizer also removes ``foo3()``. * And this in turn, enables linker to remove ``foo4()``. This example illustrates the advantage of tight integration with the; linker. Here, the optimizer can not remove ``foo3()`` without the linker's; input. Alternative Approaches; ----------------------. **Compiler driver invokes link time optimizer separately.**; In this model the link time optimizer is not able to take advantage of; information collected during the linker's normal symbol resolution phase.; In the above example, the optimizer can not remove ``foo2()`` without the; linker's input because it is externally visible. This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required.

The main advantage of this form is that it allows hoisting; invariant instructions, especially loads, into the preheader.; That could be done in non-rotated loops as well but with; some disadvantages. Let's illustrate them with an example:. .. code-block:: C. for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; auto v = *p;; use(v);; }. We assume that loading from p is invariant and use(v) is some; statement that uses v.; If we wanted to execute the load only once we could move it; ""out"" of the loop body, resulting in this:. .. code-block:: C. auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }.

The; intention is to keep the interface as stable as possible even when the LLVM; optimizer continues to evolve. It should even be possible for a completely; different compilation technology to provide a different libLTO that works with; their object files and the standard linker tool. ``lto_module_t``; ----------------. A non-native object file is handled via an ``lto_module_t``. The following; functions allow the linker to check if a file (on disk or in a memory buffer) is; a file which libLTO can process:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_is_object_file(const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_for_target(const char*, const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory(const void*, size_t); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory_for_target(const void*, size_t, const char*). If the object file can be processed by ``libLTO``, the linker creates a; ``lto_module_t`` by using one of:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_create(const char*); lto_module_create_from_memory(const void*, size_t). and when done, the handle is released via. .. code-block:: c. lto_m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:8346,optimiz,optimizer,8346,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizer']
Performance,"pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 2, i32 1; %tmp3 = load i32, ptr %tmp2; %tmp4 = add i32 %tmp3, %tmp1; %tmp5 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 0, i32 0; store i32 %tmp4, ptr %tmp5; ret void; }. In each case the second operand is the pointer through which the GEP instruction; starts. The same is true whether the second operand is an argument, allocated; memory, or a global variable. To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global i32; ...; %idx1 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 0; %idx2 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 1; %idx3 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 2. These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the base; address of ``MyVar``. They compute, as follows (using C syntax):. .. code-block:: c++. idx1 = (char*) &MyVar + 0; idx2 = (char*) &MyVar + 4; idx3 = (char*) &MyVar + 8.

Performance,"positioning the; container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining; such a container is not straightforward or even possible without; generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways; out of this:. - Defining the container for the structure as ""overlapping"" (see also; "" Overlapping Volumes **""**); - Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union; of all components (see also "" Composite Shapes ""); - Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the; navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the; number of components in the structure. The best solution is the third; one because it uses all volume-related navigation optimizations. The; class **`TGeoVolumeAssembly`** represents an assembly volume. Its shape; is represented by **`TGeoShapeAssembly`** class that is the union of all; components. It uses volume voxelization to perform navigation tasks. An assembly volume creates a hierarchical level and it geometrically; insulates the structure from the rest (as a normal volume). Physically,; a point that is INSIDE a **`TGeoShapeAssembly`** is always inside one of; the components, so a **`TGeoVolumeAssembly`** does not need to have a; medium. Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very; practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible; overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating; honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using; assemblies can be found at:; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/assembly.C.html>`.`. Creation of an assembly is very easy: one has just to create a; **`TGeoVolumeAssembly`** object and position the components inside as; for any volume:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoVolume *vol = new TGeoVolumeAssembly(name);; vol->AddNode(vdaughter1, cpy1, matrix1);; vol->AddNode(vdaughter2, cpy2, matrix2);; ```.

In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors.

When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk.

Another use of vectorize_width; is ``vectorize_width(fixed|scalable)`` where the user can hint at the type; of vectorization to use without specifying the exact width. In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors.

The fundamental correctness property for the compiled code's; correctness w.r.t. the garbage collector is a dynamic one. It must be; the case that there is no dynamic trace such that an operation; involving a potentially relocated pointer is observably-after a; safepoint which could relocate it.

To understand why this 'observable-after' property is required,; consider a null comparison performed on the original copy of a; relocated pointer. Assuming that control flow follows the safepoint,; there is no way to observe externally whether the null comparison is; performed before or after the safepoint. (Remember, the original; Value is unmodified by the safepoint.) The compiler is free to make; either scheduling choice. The actual correctness property implemented is slightly stronger than; this. We require that there be no *static path* on which a; potentially relocated pointer is 'observably-after' it may have been; relocated.

A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread.

A use example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -fprofile-generate=yyy/zzz code.cc -o code; $ ./code; $ llvm-profdata merge -output=code.profdata yyy/zzz/.

Performance,"profiles for code coverage, sample-based profiles are too; coarse-grained for code coverage purposes; it would yield poor results. 4. Sampling profiles must be generated by an external tool. The profile; generated by that tool must then be converted into a format that can be read; by LLVM. The section on sampling profilers describes one of the supported; sampling profile formats. Using Sampling Profilers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sampling profilers are used to collect runtime information, such as; hardware counters, while your application executes. They are typically; very efficient and do not incur a large runtime overhead. The; sample data collected by the profiler can be used during compilation; to determine what the most executed areas of the code are. Using the data from a sample profiler requires some changes in the way; a program is built. Before the compiler can use profiling information,; the code needs to execute under the profiler. The following is the; usual build cycle when using sample profilers for optimization:. 1. Build the code with source line table information. You can use all the; usual build flags that you always build your application with. The only; requirement is that you add ``-gline-tables-only`` or ``-g`` to the; command line. This is important for the profiler to be able to map; instructions back to source line locations. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -gline-tables-only code.cc -o code. 2. Run the executable under a sampling profiler. The specific profiler; you use does not really matter, as long as its output can be converted; into the format that the LLVM optimizer understands. Currently, there; exists a conversion tool for the Linux Perf profiler; (https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/), so these examples assume that you; are using Linux Perf to profile your code. .. code-block:: console. $ perf record -b ./code. Note the use of the ``-b`` flag. This tells Perf to use the Last Branch; Record (LBR) to record call chains.

Avoid using the :ref:`assume intrinsic <int_assume>` until you've; established that a) there's no other way to express the given fact and b); that fact is critical for optimization purposes. Assumes are a great; prototyping mechanism, but they can have negative effects on both compile; time and optimization effectiveness. The former is fixable with enough; effort, but the later is fairly fundamental to their designed purpose. Describing Language Specific Properties; =======================================. When translating a source language to LLVM, finding ways to express concepts; and guarantees available in your source language which are not natively; provided by LLVM IR will greatly improve LLVM's ability to optimize your code.; As an example, C/C++'s ability to mark every add as ""no signed wrap (nsw)"" goes; a long way to assisting the optimizer in reasoning about loop induction; variables and thus generating more optimal code for loops. The LLVM LangRef includes a number of mechanisms for annotating the IR with; additional semantic information. It is *strongly* recommended that you become; highly familiar with this document. The list below is intended to highlight a; couple of items of particular interest, but is by no means exhaustive. Restricted Operation Semantics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; #. Add nsw/nuw flags as appropriate. Reasoning about overflow is; generally hard for an optimizer so providing these facts from the frontend; can be very impactful. #. Use fast-math flags on floating point operations if legal. If you don't; need strict IEEE floating point semantics, there are a number of additional; optimizations that can be performed. This can be highly impactful for; floating point intensive computations. Describing Aliasing Properties; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #.

It receives as input a cxx_loop_proto which it then converts into a; string of valid LLVM IR: a function with either a single loop or two nested; loops. It then creates a new string of IR by running optimization passes over; the original IR. Currently, it only runs a loop-vectorize pass but more passes; can easily be added to the fuzzer. Once there are two versions of the input; function (optimized and not), llvm-proto-fuzzer uses LLVM's JIT Engine to; compile both functions. Lastly, it runs both functions on a suite of inputs and; checks that both functions behave the same on all inputs. In this way,; llvm-proto-fuzzer can find not only compiler crashes, but also miscompiles; originating from LLVM's optimization passes. llvm-proto-fuzzer is built very similarly to clang-proto-fuzzer.

By default, the page source uses an `RClusterPool` to asynchronously read-ahead data.; When a page of a certain cluster is required, the cluster pool reads pages of _active_ columns.; For instance, if only certain fields are used (e.g., through an imposed model), only the pages of columns connected to those fields are read.; Columns can be dynamically added (e.g. during event iteration, a new field view is created in a reader).; The cluster pool reads ahead a limited number of clusters given by the _cluster bunch size_ option (default = 1).; The read-ahead uses vector reads.; For the file backend, it additionally coalesces close read requests and uses uring reads when available. The page source can be restricted to a certain entry range.; This allows for optimizing the page lists that are being read.; Additionally, it allows for optimizing the cluster pool to not read-ahead beyond the limits. #### Late model extension; Reading an RNTuple with an extended model is transparent -- i.e., no additional interface calls are required.; Internally, columns that were created as part of late model extension will have synthesized zero-initialized column ranges for the clusters that were already written before the model was extended.; In addition, pages made up of 0x00 bytes are synthesized for deferred columns in the clusters that were already (partially) filled before the model was extended. Storage Backends; ----------------. Support for storage backends is implemented through derived classes of `RPageSink` and `RPageSource`.; The `RPage{Sink,Source}File` class provides a storage backend for RNTuple data in ROOT files, local or remote.; The `RPage{Sink,Source}Daos` class provides a storage backend for RNTuple data in the DAOS object store.

LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default.

SequentiallyConsistent; ----------------------. SequentiallyConsistent (``seq_cst`` in IR) provides Acquire semantics for loads; and Release semantics for stores. Additionally, it guarantees that a total; ordering exists between all SequentiallyConsistent operations. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_seq_cst``, Java volatile, and; the gcc-compatible ``__sync_*`` builtins which do not specify otherwise. Notes for frontends; If a frontend is exposing atomic operations, these are much easier to reason; about for the programmer than other kinds of operations, and using them is; generally a practical performance tradeoff. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. For; SequentiallyConsistent loads and stores, the same reorderings are allowed as; for Acquire loads and Release stores, except that SequentiallyConsistent; operations may not be reordered. Notes for code generation; SequentiallyConsistent loads minimally require the same barriers as Acquire; operations and SequentiallyConsistent stores require Release; barriers. Additionally, the code generator must enforce ordering between; SequentiallyConsistent stores followed by SequentiallyConsistent loads. This; is usually done by emitting either a full fence before the loads or a full; fence after the stores; which is preferred varies by architecture.

Issues with explicit pointee types; ==================================. LLVM IR pointers can be cast back and forth between pointers with different; pointee types. The pointee type does not necessarily represent the actual; underlying type in memory. In other words, the pointee type carries no real; semantics. Historically LLVM was some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:2458,optimiz,optimization,2458,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The token operand of a ""pad"" or ""ret"" instruction indicates which; funclet it is in, or ""none"" if it is not nested within another funclet. The ``catchpad`` and ``cleanuppad`` instructions establish new funclets, and; their tokens are consumed by other ""pad"" instructions to establish membership.; The ``catchswitch`` instruction does not create a funclet, but it produces a; token that is always consumed by its immediate successor ``catchpad``; instructions.

A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset.

However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions.

This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9.

A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets.

Code reviews help to achieve that goal.; Especially for new contributors, that often means many rounds of reviews; and push-back on design decisions that do not fit well within the; overall architecture of the project. For your first patches, this means:. - be kind, and expect reviewers to be kind in return - LLVM has a `Code; of Conduct <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html>`__;. - be patient - understanding how a new feature fits into the; architecture of the project is often a time consuming effort, and; people have to juggle this with other responsibilities in their; lives; **ping the review once a week** when there is no response;. - if you can't agree, generally the best way is to do what the reviewer; asks; we optimize for readability of the code, which the reviewer is; in a better position to judge; if this feels like it's not the right; option, you can contact the cfe-dev mailing list to get more feedback; on the direction;.

Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand.

Performance,"quivalently, interpret) everything. On the far ; other side, traditional static compilers process everything statically and ; nothing dynamically. These approaches have typically been seen as a ; tradeoff between performance and portability. On a deeper level, however, ; there are two reasons that optimal system performance may be obtained by a; system somewhere in between these two extremes: Dynamic application ; behavior and social constraints. From a technical perspective, pure static compilation cannot ever give ; optimal performance in all cases, because applications have varying dynamic; behavior that the static compiler cannot take into consideration. Even ; compilers that support profile guided optimization generate poor code in ; the real world, because using such optimization tunes that application ; to one particular usage pattern, whereas real programs (as opposed to ; benchmarks) often have several different usage patterns. On a social level, static compilation is a very shortsighted solution to ; the performance problem. Instruction set architectures (ISAs) continuously ; evolve, and each implementation of an ISA (a processor) must choose a set ; of tradeoffs that make sense in the market context that it is designed for. ; With every new processor introduced, the vendor faces two fundamental ; problems: First, there is a lag time between when a processor is introduced ; to when compilers generate quality code for the architecture. Secondly, ; even when compilers catch up to the new architecture there is often a large ; body of legacy code that was compiled for previous generations and will ; not or can not be upgraded. Thus a large percentage of code running on a ; processor may be compiled quite sub-optimally for the current ; characteristics of the dynamic execution environment. For these reasons, LLVM has been designed from the beginning as a long-term ; solution to these problems.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations. This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple by around 30% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.; - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.; - Move RStringView.h to ROOT/RStringView.hxx and always include ROOT/RStringView.hxx instead of RStringView.h for backward compatibility; - In `TClingCallFunc`, support r-value reference parameters. This paves the way for the corresponding support in PyROOT (implemented now in the latest Cppyy).; - Included the new TSequentialExecutor in ROOT, sharing the interfaces of TExecutor.This should improve code economy when providing a fallback for TThreadExecutor/TProcessExecutor. ### Thread safety; - Resolved several race conditions, dead-locks, performance and order of initialization/destruction issues still lingering because of or despite the new read-write lock mechanism. ## Interpreter. - Enabled use of multi-threaded code from the interpreter.; - Previouslyl multi-threaded code could be run from the interpreter as long as ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md:1898,perform,performance,1898,README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

The original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` produced models that consisted of a; Poisson term for each bin. In this ""number counting form"" the dataset has one; row and the collumns corresponded to the number of events for each bin. This; led to severe performance problems in statistical tools that generated; pseudo-experiments and evaluated likelihood ratio test statistics.

Therefore, the original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` is now removed to avoid; confusion and maintainance burden. #### Removing constant parameter flag from RooStats:HistFactory::NormFactor.

Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``\ s has quadratic time complexity and is not done; by default.

The Driver itself is intended to be invariant during; construction of a Compilation; an IDE should be able to construct a; single long lived driver instance to use for an entire build, for; example. The Compilation object holds information that is particular to each; compilation sequence. For example, the list of used temporary files; (which must be removed once compilation is finished) and result files; (which should be removed if compilation fails). Unified Parsing & Pipelining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Parsing and pipelining both occur without reference to a Compilation; instance. This is by design; the driver expects that both of these; phases are platform neutral, with a few very well defined exceptions; such as whether the platform uses a driver driver. ToolChain Argument Translation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In order to match gcc very closely, the clang driver currently allows; tool chains to perform their own translation of the argument list (into; a new ArgList data structure). Although this allows the clang driver to; match gcc easily, it also makes the driver operation much harder to; understand (since the Tools stop seeing some arguments the user; provided, and see new ones instead). For example, on Darwin ``-gfull`` gets translated into two separate; arguments, ``-g`` and ``-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols``. Trying to; write Tool logic to do something with ``-gfull`` will not work, because; Tool argument translation is done after the arguments have been; translated. A long term goal is to remove this tool chain specific translation, and; instead force each tool to change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments.

This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer. Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself.

The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself. You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAULT)). It is also possible to tune this 'cache-and-track' optimization to perform a more fine-grained caching; of components than Optimize(2) implements: to do so, call arg->setAttribute(""CacheAndTrack"") on each; pdf component that you'd like to be cache-and-tracked individually.

Final Suspend; -------------. A coroutine author or a frontend may designate a particular suspend to be final,; by setting the second argument of the `coro.suspend`_ intrinsic to `true`.; Such a suspend point has two properties:. * it is possible to check whether a suspended coroutine is at the final suspend; point via `coro.done`_ intrinsic;. * a resumption of a coroutine stopped at the final suspend point leads to; undefined behavior. The only possible action for a coroutine at a final; suspend point is destroying it via `coro.destroy`_ intrinsic. From the user perspective, the final suspend point represents an idea of a; coroutine reaching the end. From the compiler perspective, it is an optimization; opportunity for reducing number of resume points (and therefore switch cases) in; the resume function. The following is an example of a function that keeps resuming the coroutine; until the final suspend point is reached after which point the coroutine is; destroyed:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @main() {; entry:; %hdl = call ptr @f(i32 4); br label %while; while:; call void @llvm.coro.resume(ptr %hdl); %done = call i1 @llvm.coro.done(ptr %hdl); br i1 %done, label %end, label %while; end:; call void @llvm.coro.destroy(ptr %hdl); ret i32 0; }.

You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order.

Performance,"r shared variables. Notes for frontends; This cannot be used for synchronization, but is useful for Java and other; ""safe"" languages which need to guarantee that the generated code never; exhibits undefined behavior. Note that this guarantee is cheap on common; platforms for loads of a native width, but can be expensive or unavailable for; wider loads, like a 64-bit store on ARM. (A frontend for Java or other ""safe""; languages would normally split a 64-bit store on ARM into two 32-bit unordered; stores.). Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this prohibits any transformation that transforms a; single load into multiple loads, transforms a store into multiple stores,; narrows a store, or stores a value which would not be stored otherwise. Some; examples of unsafe optimizations are narrowing an assignment into a bitfield,; rematerializing a load, and turning loads and stores into a memcpy; call. Reordering unordered operations is safe, though, and optimizers should; take advantage of that because unordered operations are common in languages; that need them. Notes for code generation; These operations are required to be atomic in the sense that if you use; unordered loads and unordered stores, a load cannot see a value which was; never stored. A normal load or store instruction is usually sufficient, but; note that an unordered load or store cannot be split into multiple; instructions (or an instruction which does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM).

Performance,"r vector stores). Implementation; ==============. There are 3 parts to the implementation:. 1. Predicate ``LDR`` and ``STR`` instructions so that they are never allowed to be selected to generate vector loads and stores. The exception is one-lane vectors [1]_ - these by definition cannot have lane ordering problems so are fine to use ``LDR``/``STR``. 2. Create code generation patterns for bitconverts that create ``REV`` instructions. 3. Make sure appropriate bitconverts are created so that vector values get passed over call boundaries as 1-element vectors (which is the same as if they were loaded with ``LDR``). Bitconverts; -----------. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastfail.png; :align: right. The main problem with the ``LD1`` solution is dealing with bitconverts (or bitcasts, or reinterpret casts). These are pseudo instructions that only change the compiler's interpretation of data, not the underlying data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again (called a ""round trip""), the memory contents should be the same after the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y. This would produce a code sequence such as that in the figure on the right. The mismatched ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` cause the stored data to differ from the loaded data. .. container:: clearer. When we see a bitcast from type ``X`` to type ``Y``, what we need to do is to change the in-register representation of the data to be *as if* it had just been loaded by a ``LD1`` of type ``Y``. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastsuccess.png; :align: right. Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:10090,load,loaded,10090,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,2,['load'],"['load', 'loaded']"
Performance,"r(std::move(FPM)));. Generally you want to group CGSCC/function/loop passes together in a pass; manager, as opposed to adding adaptors for each pass to the containing upper; level pass manager. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. ModulePassManager MPM;; MPM.addPass(createModuleToFunctionPassAdaptor(FunctionPass1()));; MPM.addPass(createModuleToFunctionPassAdaptor(FunctionPass2()));; MPM.run();. will run ``FunctionPass1`` on each function in a module, then run; ``FunctionPass2`` on each function in the module. In contrast,. .. code-block:: c++. ModulePassManager MPM;. FunctionPassManager FPM;; FPM.addPass(FunctionPass1());; FPM.addPass(FunctionPass2());. MPM.addPass(createModuleToFunctionPassAdaptor(std::move(FPM)));. will run ``FunctionPass1`` and ``FunctionPass2`` on the first function in a; module, then run both passes on the second function in the module, and so on.; This is better for cache locality around LLVM data structures. This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++.

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic.

Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation.

The Frontend library contains functionality useful for building tools on top of; the Clang libraries, for example several methods for outputting diagnostics. Compiler Invocation; -------------------. One of the classes provided by the Frontend library is ``CompilerInvocation``,; which holds information that describe current invocation of the Clang ``-cc1``; frontend. The information typically comes from the command line constructed by; the Clang driver or from clients performing custom initialization. The data; structure is split into logical units used by different parts of the compiler,; for example ``PreprocessorOptions``, ``LanguageOptions`` or ``CodeGenOptions``. Command Line Interface; ----------------------. The command line interface of the Clang ``-cc1`` frontend is defined alongside; the driver options in ``clang/Driver/Options.td``. The information making up an; option definition includes its prefix and name (for example ``-std=``), form and; position of the option value, help text, aliases and more. Each option may; belong to a certain group and can be marked with zero or more flags. Options; accepted by the ``-cc1`` frontend are marked with the ``CC1Option`` flag. Command Line Parsing; --------------------. Option definitions are processed by the ``-gen-opt-parser-defs`` tablegen; backend during early stages of the build. Options are then used for querying an; instance ``llvm::opt::ArgList``, a wrapper",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:26789,perform,performing,26789,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['perform'],['performing']
Performance,"rStrongerThan``: These are predicates on; orderings. They can be useful for passes that are aware of atomics, for; example to do DSE across a single atomic access, but not across a; release-acquire pair (see MemoryDependencyAnalysis for an example of this). * Alias analysis: Note that AA will return ModRef for anything Acquire or; Release, and for the address accessed by any Monotonic operation. To support optimizing around atomic operations, make sure you are using the; right predicates; everything should work if that is done. If your pass should; optimize some atomic operations (Unordered operations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow call. * DSE: Unordered stores can be DSE'ed like normal stores. Monotonic stores can; be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially; important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger; atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to; MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,; because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with; atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen; ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes.; On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like; ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if; ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:17369,load,loads,17369,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

We should lower store(fneg(load p), q) into an integer load+xor+store, which; eliminates a constant pool load. For example, consider:. define i64 @ccosf(float %z.0, float %z.1) nounwind readonly {; entry:; %tmp6 = fsub float -0.000000e+00, %z.1		; <float> [#uses=1]; %tmp20 = tail call i64 @ccoshf( float %tmp6, float %z.0 ) nounwind readonly; ret i64 %tmp20; }; declare i64 @ccoshf(float %z.0, float %z.1) nounwind readonly.

The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`.

Because nothing is known about the behavior of ``ModulePass``; subclasses, no optimization can be done for their execution. A module pass can use function level passes (e.g. dominators) using the; ``getAnalysis`` interface ``getAnalysis<DominatorTree>(llvm::Function *)`` to; provide the function to retrieve analysis result for, if the function pass does; not require any module or immutable passes. Note that this can only be done; for functions for which the analysis ran, e.g. in the case of dominators you; should only ask for the ``DominatorTree`` for function definitions, not; declarations. To write a correct ``ModulePass`` subclass, derive from ``ModulePass`` and; override the ``runOnModule`` method with the following signature:. The ``runOnModule`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. code-block:: c++. virtual bool runOnModule(Module &M) = 0;. The ``runOnModule`` method performs the interesting work of the pass.

The `CallGraphSCCPass; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1CallGraphSCCPass.html>`_ is used by; passes that need to traverse the program bottom-up on the call graph (callees; before callers). Deriving from ``CallGraphSCCPass`` provides some mechanics; for building and traversing the ``CallGraph``, but also allows the system to; optimize execution of ``CallGraphSCCPass``\ es.

The ``JITDylib`` determines *where* the definitions; reside, the layers determine *how* the definitions will be compiled.; Linkage relationships between ``JITDylibs`` determine how inter-module; references are resolved, and symbol resolvers are no longer used. See the; section `Design Overview`_ for more details. Unless multiple JITDylibs are needed to model linkage relationships, ORCv1; clients should place all code in a single JITDylib.; MCJIT clients should use LLJIT (see `LLJIT and LLLazyJIT`_), and can place; code in LLJIT's default created main JITDylib (See; ``LLJIT::getMainJITDylib()``). 2. All JIT stacks now need an ``ExecutionSession`` instance. ExecutionSession; manages the string pool, error reporting, synchronization, and symbol; lookup. 3. ORCv2 uses uniqued strings (``SymbolStringPtr`` instances) rather than; string values in order to reduce memory overhead and improve lookup; performance. See the subsection `How to manage symbol strings`_. 4. IR layers require ThreadSafeModule instances, rather than; std::unique_ptr<Module>s. ThreadSafeModule is a wrapper that ensures that; Modules that use the same LLVMContext are not accessed concurrently.; See `How to use ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext`_. 5. Symbol lookup is no longer handled by layers. Instead, there is a; ``lookup`` method on JITDylib that takes a list of JITDylibs to scan. .. code-block:: c++.

Performance,"ranch containing the number of tracks is; read. In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`. The; performance depends not only of the processor type, but also of the disk; devices (local, NFS, AFS, etc.). ## Chains; \index{tree!chains}. A **`TChain`** object is a list of ROOT files containing the same tree.; As an example, assume we have three files called; `file1.root, file2.root, file3.root`. Each file contains one tree called; ""`T`"". We can create a chain with the following statements:. ``` {.cpp}; TChain chain(""T""); // name of the tree is the argument; chain.Add(""file1.root"");; chain.Add(""file2.root"");; chain.Add(""file3.root"");; ```. The name of the **`TChain`** will be the same as the name of the tree;; in this case it will be `""T"". Note that two `objects can have the same; name as long as they are not histograms in the same directory, because; there, the histogram names are used to build a hash table.

The C++ class is defined through the `gROOT.ProcessLine()` call, and; note how the `AddressOf()` function is used for data members of built-in; type. Most of the above is for ROOT version 5.02 and later only. For; older releases, and without further support, here is an example as to; how you can get hold of a pointer-to-pointer to a ROOT object:. ``` {.cpp}; h = TH1F(); addressofobject = array('i',[h.IsA().DynamicCast(h.IsA(),h)]); ```. ### Using Your Own Classes. A user's own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or; indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary. One easy way of; obtaining such a library, is by using ACLiC:. ``` {.cpp}; $ cat MyClass.C; class MyClass {; public:. MyClass(int value = 0) {; m_value = value;; }. void SetValue(int value) {; m_value = value;; }. int GetValue() {; return m_value;; }. private:; int m_value;; };. $ echo .L MyClass.C+ | root.exe -b; [...]; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library [..]/./MyClass_C.so; $; ```. Then you can use it, for example, like so:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import gSystem. # load library with MyClass dictionary; gSystem.Load('MyClass_C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass; # use MyClass; m = MyClass(42); print(m.GetValue()); ```. You can also load a macro directly, but if you do not use ACLiC, you; will be restricted to use the default constructor of your class, which; is otherwise fully functional. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import gROOT. # load MyClass definition macro (append '+' to use ACLiC); gROOT.LoadMacro('MyClass.C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass. # use MyClass; m = MyClass(); m.SetValue(42); print(m.GetValue()); ```; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:33142,load,load,33142,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,3,['load'],['load']

For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of size between 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule. Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag. This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the full; tag interpretation (where the pointer tag is between 1 and `TG-1` and the; last byte of the granule is ordinary data) and the short tag interpretation; (where the pointer tag is stored in the granule). When HWASAN detects an error near a memory tag between 1 and `TG-1`, it; will show both the memory tag and the last byte of the granule. Currently,; it is up to the user to disambiguate the two possibilities. Instrumentation; ===============.

Performance,"rces in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow.

In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks.

Performance,"rd defines what an ""integer constant; expression"" (i-c-e) is with very precise and specific requirements. The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfield, the value for a case statement, etc). For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others. C99 obviously does not specify the semantics of any of these; extensions, and the definition of i-c-e does not include them. However, these; extensions are often used in real code, and we have to have a way to reason; about them. Finally, this is not just a problem for semantic analysis. The code generator; and other clients have to be able to fold constants (e.g., to initialize global; variables) and have to handle a superset of what C99 allows. Further, these; clients can benefit from extended information. For example, we know that; ""``foo() || 1``"" always evaluates to ``true``, but we can't replace the; expression wi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:119734,optimiz,optimizer,119734,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['optimiz'],['optimizer']

Bitconverts; -----------. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastfail.png; :align: right. The main problem with the ``LD1`` solution is dealing with bitconverts (or bitcasts, or reinterpret casts). These are pseudo instructions that only change the compiler's interpretation of data, not the underlying data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again (called a ""round trip""), the memory contents should be the same after the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y.

Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to change the representation to be as if it had been loaded by an ``LD1`` of type ``Y``.

A; minor version increment is for added functionality, and patch version; increments are for bugfixes. Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports; ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no; impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables. Using the profiling runtime without static initializers; =======================================================. By default the compiler runtime uses a static initializer to determine the; profile output path and to register a writer function. To collect profiles; without using static initializers, do this manually:. * Export a ``int __llvm_profile_runtime`` symbol from each instrumented shared; library and executable. When the linker finds a definition of this symbol, it; knows to skip loading the object which contains the profiling runtime's; static initializer. * Forward-declare ``void __llvm_profile_initialize_file(void)`` and call it; once from each instrumented executable.

Performance,"re (AArch64), 4.1.2 Short Vectors. The use of ``LDR`` and ``STR`` as the ABI defines has at least one advantage over ``LD1`` and ``ST1``. ``LDR`` and ``STR`` are oblivious to the size of the individual lanes of a vector. ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` are not - the lane size is encoded within them. This is important across an ABI boundary, because it would become necessary to know the lane width the callee expects. Consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c. <callee.c>; void callee(uint32x2_t v) {; ...; }. <caller.c>; extern void callee(uint32x2_t);; void caller() {; callee(...);; }. If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use ``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the ``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``). Most operating systems however do not run with alignment faults enabled, so this is often not an issue. Summary; -------. The following table summarises the instructions that are required to be emitted for each property mentioned above for each of the two solutions. +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+; | | ``LDR`` layout | ``LD1`` layout |; +===============================+==========",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:7238,load,loading,7238,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['loading']

Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #. Prefer globals over inttoptr of a constant address - this gives you; dereferencability information. In MCJIT, use getSymbolAddress to provide; actual address. #. Be wary of ordered and atomic memory operations. They are hard to optimize; and may not be well optimized by the current optimizer. Depending on your; source language, you may consider using fences instead. #. If calling a function which is known to throw an exception (unwind), use; an invoke with a normal destination which contains an unreachable; instruction. This form conveys to the optimizer that the call returns; abnormally. For an invoke which neither returns normally or requires unwind; code in the current function, you can use a noreturn call instruction if; desired. This is generally not required because the optimizer will convert; an invoke with an unreachable unwind destination to a call instruction. #. Use profile metadata to indicate statically known cold paths, even if; dynamic profiling information is not available. This can make a large; difference in code placement and thus the performance of tight loops. #. When generating code for loops, try to avoid terminating the header block of; the loop earlier than necessary. If the terminator of the loop header; block is a loop exiting conditional branch, the effectiveness of LICM will; be limited for loads not in the header.

Each sampled line may contain several items. Some are optional (marked; below):. a. Source line offset. This number represents the line number; in the function where the sample was collected. The line number is; always relative to the line where symbol of the function is; defined. So, if the function has its header at line 280, the offset; 13 is at line 293 in the file. Note that this offset should never be a negative number. This could; happen in cases like macros. The debug machinery will register the; line number at the point of macro expansion. So, if the macro was; expanded in a line before the start of the function, the profile; converter should emit a 0 as the offset (this means that the optimizers; will not be able to associate a meaningful weight to the instructions; in the macro). b.

But both calls to ``foo`` and ``bar`` are at the same source; line, so a sample count at that line is not sufficient. The; compiler needs to know which part of that line is taken more; frequently.

The following options exist in RNTuple for multithreaded data processing. ### Implicit Multi-Threading; When `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` is used, RNTuple uses ROOT's task arena to compress and decompress pages.; That requires writes to be buffered and reads uses the cluster pool resp.; The RNTuple data source for RDataFrame lets RDataFrame full control of the thread pool.; That means that RDataFrame uses a separate data source for every thread, each of the data sources runs in sequential mode. ### Concurrent Readers; Multiple readers can read the same RNTuple concurrently as long as access to every individual reader is sequential. ### Parallel REntry Preparation; Multiple `REntry` object can be concurrently prepared by multiple threads.; I.e., construction and binding of the objects can happen in parallel.; The actual reading and writing of entries (`RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`, `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`) needs to be protected by a mutex.; This is considered ""mild scalability parallelization"" in RNTuple. ### RNTupleParallelWriter; The parallel writer offers the most scalable parallel writing interface.; Multiple _fill contexts_ can concurrently serialize and compress data.; Every fill context prepares a set of entire clusters in the final on-disk layout.; When a fill context flushes data,; a brief serialization point handles the RNTuple meta-data updates and the reservation of disk space to write into.

ARC chooses to always; assume that objects are initialized (except when it is in charge of; initializing them) because the only workable alternative would be to; ban all code patterns that could potentially be used to access; uninitialized memory, and that would be too limiting.

More often than not, bugs in the compiler cause it to crash---often due to; an assertion failure of some sort. The most important piece of the puzzle; is to figure out if it is crashing in the Clang front-end or if it is one of; the LLVM libraries (e.g. the optimizer or code generator) that has; problems. To figure out which component is crashing (the front-end, middle-end; optimizer, or backend code generator), run the ``clang`` command line as you; were when the crash occurred, but with the following extra command line; options:. * ``-emit-llvm -Xclang -disable-llvm-passes``: If ``clang`` still crashes when; passed these options (which disable the optimizer and code generator), then; the crash is in the front-end. Jump ahead to :ref:`front-end bugs; <frontend-crash>`. * ``-emit-llvm``: If ``clang`` crashes with this option (which disables; the code generator), you found a middle-end optimizer bug. Jump ahead to; :ref:`middle-end bugs <middleend-crash>`. * Otherwise, you have a backend code generator crash. Jump ahead to :ref:`code; generator bugs <backend-crash>`. .. _frontend-crash:.

More information on the OpenMP runtimes can be; found at the `OpenMP documentation page <https://openmp.llvm.org>`__. .. _Offloading Overview:. Offloading Overview; -------------------. The goal of offloading compilation is to create an executable device image that; can be run on the target device. OpenMP offloading creates executable images by; compiling the input file for both the host and the target device. The output; from the device phase then needs to be embedded into the host to create a fat; object. A special tool then needs to extract the device code from the fat; objects, run the device linking step, and embed the final image in a symbol the; host runtime library can use to register the library and access the symbols on; the device. Compilation Process; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The compiler performs the following high-level actions to generate OpenMP; offloading code:. * Compile the input file for the host to produce a bitcode file. Lower ``#pragma; omp target`` declarations to :ref:`offloading entries <Generating Offloading; Entries>` and create metadata to indicate which entries are on the device.; * Compile the input file for the target :ref:`device <Device Compilation>` using; the :ref:`offloading entry <Generating Offloading Entries>` metadata created; by the host.; * Link the OpenMP device runtime library and run the backend to create a device; object file.; * Run the backend on the host bitcode file and create a :ref:`fat object file; <Creating Fat Objects>` using the device object file.; * Pass the fat object file to the :ref:`linker wrapper tool <Device Linking>`; and extract the device objects.

Since the release 5.10, SMatrix supports symmetric matrices using; a storage class (ROOT::Math::MatRepSym) which contains only the N*(N+1)/2 independent element; of a NxN symmetric matrix.; It is not in the mandate of this package to provide a complete linear algebra functionality; for these classes. What is provided are basic \ref MatrixFunctions and \ref VectFunction,; such as the matrix-matrix, matrix-vector, vector-vector operations, plus some extra; functionality for square matrices, like inversion, which is based on the optimized Cramer; method for squared matrices of size up to 6x6, and determinant calculation.; For a more detailed descriptions and usage examples see:. * \ref SVectorDoc; * \ref SMatrixDoc; * \ref MatVecFunctions. The SMatrix package contains only header files. Normally one does not need to build any library.; In the %ROOT distribution a library, _libSmatrix_ is produced with the C++ dictionary information; for vectors, symmetric and squared matrices for double, float types up to dimension 7.; The current version of SMatrix can be downloaded from [here](../SMatrix.tar.gz). If you want; to install the header files or run the test _configure_ script and then _make install_ or; _make check_ to build the tests. No dictionary library is built in this case. ## References. 1.

Address Spaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. You may have noticed that all of the pointer types in the LLVM IR example had; an explicit address space specifier. What is address space 1? NVIDIA GPU; devices (generally) have four types of memory:. - Global: Large, off-chip memory; - Shared: Small, on-chip memory shared among all threads in a CTA; - Local: Per-thread, private memory; - Constant: Read-only memory shared across all threads. These different types of memory are represented in LLVM IR as address spaces.; There is also a fifth address space used by the NVPTX code generator that; corresponds to the ""generic"" address space. This address space can represent; addresses in any other address space (with a few exceptions). This allows; users to write IR functions that can load/store memory using the same; instructions. Intrinsics are provided to convert pointers between the generic; and non-generic address spaces. See :ref:`address_spaces` and :ref:`nvptx_intrinsics` for more information. Kernel Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In PTX, a function can be either a `kernel` function (callable from the host; program), or a `device` function (callable only from GPU code). You can think; of `kernel` functions as entry-points in the GPU program. To mark an LLVM IR; function as a `kernel` function, we make use of special LLVM metadata. The; NVPTX back-end will look for a named metadata node called; ``nvvm.annotations``. This named metadata must contain a list of metadata that; describe the IR. For our purposes, we need to declare a metadata node that; assigns the ""kernel"" attribute to the LLVM IR function that should be emitted; as a PTX `kernel` function. These metadata nodes take the form:. .. code-block:: text. !{<function ref>, metadata !""kernel"", i32 1}.

Cache Pruning; -------------. To help keep the size of the cache under control, ThinLTO supports cache; pruning. Cache pruning is supported with gold, ld64, and lld, but currently only; gold and lld allow you to control the policy with a policy string. The cache; policy must be specified with a linker option. - gold (as of LLVM 6.0):; ``-Wl,-plugin-opt,cache-policy=POLICY``; - ELF ld.lld (as of LLVM 5.0), Mach-O ld64.lld (as of LLVM 15.0):; ``-Wl,--thinlto-cache-policy=POLICY``; - COFF lld-link (as of LLVM 6.0):; ``/lldltocachepolicy:POLICY``. A policy string is a series of key-value pairs separated by ``:`` characters.; Possible key-value pairs are:. - ``cache_size=X%``: The maximum size for the cache directory is ``X`` percent; of the available space on the disk. Set to 100 to indicate no limit,; 50 to indicate that the cache size will not be left over half the available; disk space. A value over 100 is invalid. A value of 0 disables the percentage; size-based pruning. The default is 75%. - ``cache_size_bytes=X``, ``cache_size_bytes=Xk``, ``cache_size_bytes=Xm``,; ``cache_size_bytes=Xg``:; Sets the maximum size for the cache directory to ``X`` bytes (or KB, MB,; GB respectively). A value over the amount of available space on the disk; will be reduced to the amount of available space. A value of 0 disables; the byte size-based pruning. The default is no byte size-based pruning.

At the bottom of our JIT we add a private method to do the actual optimization:; *optimizeModule*. This function takes the module to be transformed as input (as; a ThreadSafeModule) along with a reference to a reference to a new class:; ``MaterializationResponsibility``. The MaterializationResponsibility argument; can be used to query JIT state for the module being transformed, such as the set; of definitions in the module that JIT'd code is actively trying to call/access.; For now we will ignore this argument and use a standard optimization; pipeline. To do this we set up a FunctionPassManager, add some passes to it, run; it over every function in the module, and then return the mutated module. The; specific optimizations are the same ones used in `Chapter 4 <LangImpl04.html>`_; of the ""Implementing a language with LLVM"" tutorial series. Readers may visit; that chapter for a more in-depth discussion of these, and of IR optimization in; general.

Status of the New and Legacy Pass Managers; ==========================================. LLVM currently contains two pass managers, the legacy PM and the new PM. The; optimization pipeline (aka the middle-end) uses the new PM, whereas the backend; target-dependent code generation uses the legacy PM. The legacy PM somewhat works with the optimization pipeline, but this is; deprecated and there are ongoing efforts to remove its usage. Some IR passes are considered part of the backend codegen pipeline even if; they are LLVM IR passes (whereas all MIR passes are codegen passes). This; includes anything added via ``TargetPassConfig`` hooks, e.g.; ``TargetPassConfig::addCodeGenPrepare()``. The ``TargetMachine::adjustPassManager()`` function that was used to extend a; legacy PM with passes on a per target basis has been removed. It was mainly; used from opt, but since support for using the default pipelines has been; removed in opt the function isn't needed any longer. In the new PM such; adjustments are done by using ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()``.

Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries.

Performance,"rectives can be embedded using strings so you still have access to; the convenience available in llvm-lit. Debugging; ---------. One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png. The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG. This can prevent some optimizations as GlobalISel is generally able to work on a; single function at a time. This technique can be repeated for different; combinations of basic blocks until you have identified the critical blocks; involved in a bug. Once the critical blocks have been identified, you can further increase the; resolution to the critical instructions by splitting the blocks like from:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; ... instructions group 2 ... into:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; br %bb2. bb2:; ... instructions group 2 ... and then repeating the process for the new blocks. It's also possible to use this technique in a mode where the main function; is compiled with GlobalISel and the extracted basic blocks are compiled with; SelectionDAG (or the other way around) to leverage the existing quality of; another code generator to track down bugs. This technique can also be used to; improve the similarity between fast and slow code when tracking down performance; regressions and help you zero in on a particular cause of the regression.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst:6890,perform,performance,6890,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"rectories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2.

The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general. If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the; ""libcalls"" test as an example. It can be run like this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=libcalls report.

The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase.

New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs.

The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation.

Performance,"rementioned free function. **Sample Steps**: To add Code Generation support to an existing RooFit class,; following is a sample set of steps (using the aforementioned approach of; extracting free functions in a separate file.). **1. Extract logic into a separate file** Implement what your class is; supposed to do as a free function in [MathFuncs].; This implementation must be compatible with the syntax supported by Clad. **2. Refactor evaluate():** Refactor the existing `RooAbsReal::evaluate()`; function to use the `MathFuncs.h` implementation. This is optional, but; can reduce code duplication and potential for bugs. This may require some; effort if an extensive caching infrastructure is used in your model. **3. Add translate():** RooFit classes are extended using a (typically) simple; `translate()` function that extracts the mathematically differentiable; properties out of the RooFit classes that make up the statistical model. The `translate()` function helps implement the Code Squashing logic that is; used to optimize numerical evaluations. It accomplishes this by using a small; subset of helper functions that are available in the; `RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext` and `RooFuncWrapper` classes; (see Appendix B). It converts a RooFit expression into a form that can be; efficiently evaluated by Clad. The `translate()` function returns an `std::string` representing the; underlying mathematical notation of the class as code, that can later be; concatenated into a single string representing the entire model. This string; of code is then just-in-time compiled by Cling (a C++ interpreter for Root). **4. analyticalIntegral() Use Case:** If your class includes (or should; include) the `analyticalIntegral()` function, then a simple; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function needs to be created to help call the; `analyticalIntegral()` function. # Example for adding Code Generation support to RooFit classes.

The method; returns a pointer to the ""deepest node"" that geometrically contains *P*; (in our case let us suppose it is `B\_3`). Since a node is just a; positioned volume, we can then get a pointer to the volume, medium or; material objects related to it.

We also need this for locally streaming functions, where an ``SMSTART`` needs to; be inserted into the DAG at the start of the function. Functions with __attribute__((arm_locally_streaming)); -----------------------------------------------------. If a function is marked as ``arm_locally_streaming``, then the runtime SVE; vector length in the prologue/epilogue may be different from the vector length; in the function's body. This happens because we invoke smstart after setting up; the stack-frame and similarly invoke smstop before deallocating the stack-frame. To ensure we use the correct SVE vector length to allocate the locals with, we; can use the streaming vector-length to allocate the stack-slots through the; ``ADDSVL`` instruction, even when the CPU is not yet in streaming mode. This only works for locals and not callee-save slots, since LLVM doesn't support; mixing two different scalable vector lengths in one stack frame. That means that the; case where a function is marked ``arm_locally_streaming`` and needs to spill SVE; callee-saves in the prologue is currently unsupported. However, it is unlikely; for this to happen without user intervention, because ``arm_locally_streaming``; functions cannot take or return vector-length-dependent values.

Performance,"ribution of LLVM; ===============================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. This document is geared toward people who want to build and package LLVM and any; combination of LLVM sub-project tools for distribution. This document covers; useful features of the LLVM build system as well as best practices and general; information about packaging LLVM. If you are new to CMake you may find the :doc:`CMake` or :doc:`CMakePrimer`; documentation useful. Some of the things covered in this document are the inner; workings of the builds described in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication.

Performance,"rieties of garbage collectors. The Shadow Stack GC; ----------------------. To use this collector strategy, mark your functions with:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""shadow-stack"");. Unlike many GC algorithms which rely on a cooperative code generator to compile; stack maps, this algorithm carefully maintains a linked list of stack roots; [:ref:`Henderson2002 <henderson02>`]. This so-called ""shadow stack"" mirrors the; machine stack. Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple. (This code is heavily commented to help you understand the; data structure, but there are only 20 lines of meaningful code.). .. code-block:: c++. /// The map for a single function's stack frame.

Performance,"ring about two questions. * When should something belong to a checker and when should something belong to the engine?; Sometimes we model library aspects in the engine and model language constructs in checkers. * What is the checker programming model that we are aiming for? Maximum freedom or more easy checker development?. I think if we aim for maximum freedom, we do not need to worry about the; potential stress on checkers, and we can introduce abstractions to mitigate that; later on.; If we want to simplify the API, then maybe it makes more sense to move language; construct modeling to the engine when the checker API is not sufficient instead; of complicating the API. Right now I have no preference or objections between the alternatives but there; are some random thoughts:. * Maybe it would be great to have a guideline how to evolve the analyzer and; follow it, so it can help us to decide in similar situations. * I do care about performance in this case. The reason is that we have a; limited performance budget. And I think we should not expect most of the checker; writers to add modeling of language constructs. So, in my opinion, it is ok to; have less nice/more verbose API for language modeling if we can have better; performance this way, since it only needs to be done once, and is done by the; framework developers. **Artem:** These are some great questions, i guess it'd be better to discuss; them more openly. As a quick dump of my current mood:. * To me it seems obvious that we need to aim for a checker API that is both; simple and powerful. This can probably by keeping the API as powerful as; necessary while providing a layer of simple ready-made solutions on top of it.; Probably a few reusable components for assembling checkers. And this layer; should ideally be pleasant enough to work with, so that people would prefer to; extend it when something is lacking, instead of falling back to the complex; omnipotent API.

Performance,"ring compiler-compile time. For example, the integer ""``(not; x)``"" operation is actually defined as a pattern fragment that expands as; ""``(xor x, -1)``"", since the SelectionDAG does not have a native '``not``'; operation. Targets can define their own short-hand fragments as they see fit.; See the definition of '``not``' and '``ineg``' for examples. * In addition to instructions, targets can specify arbitrary patterns that map; to one or more instructions using the 'Pat' class. For example, the PowerPC; has no way to load an arbitrary integer immediate into a register in one; instruction. To tell tblgen how to do this, it defines:. ::. // Arbitrary immediate support. Implement in terms of LIS/ORI.; def : Pat<(i32 imm:$imm),; (ORI (LIS (HI16 imm:$imm)), (LO16 imm:$imm))>;. If none of the single-instruction patterns for loading an immediate into a; register match, this will be used. This rule says ""match an arbitrary i32; immediate, turning it into an ``ORI`` ('or a 16-bit immediate') and an ``LIS``; ('load 16-bit immediate, where the immediate is shifted to the left 16 bits'); instruction"". To make this work, the ``LO16``/``HI16`` node transformations; are used to manipulate the input immediate (in this case, take the high or low; 16-bits of the immediate). * When using the 'Pat' class to map a pattern to an instruction that has one; or more complex operands (like e.g. `X86 addressing mode`_), the pattern may; either specify the operand as a whole using a ``ComplexPattern``, or else it; may specify the components of the complex operand separately. The latter is; done e.g. for pre-increment instructions by the PowerPC back end:. ::. def STWU : DForm_1<37, (outs ptr_rc:$ea_res), (ins GPRC:$rS, memri:$dst),; ""stwu $rS, $dst"", LdStStoreUpd, []>,; RegConstraint<""$dst.reg = $ea_res"">, NoEncode<""$ea_res"">;. def : Pat<(pre_store GPRC:$rS, ptr_rc:$ptrreg, iaddroff:$ptroff),; (STWU GPRC:$rS, iaddroff:$ptroff, ptr_rc:$ptrreg)>;.

The; ``module`` element defining a module ID must always be emitted before any; other elements that refer to that module ID, so that a filter never needs to; keep track of dangling references. The second ``%s`` is the module type and it; determines what the remaining fields are. The following module types are; supported:. * ``elf:%x``. Here ``%x`` encodes an ELF Build ID. The Build ID should refer to a single; linked binary. The Build ID string is the sole way to identify the binary from; which this module was loaded. Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, and the size rounded up.

The default values are as follows:. - Primary tick marks: 3.0 %. - Secondary tick marks: 1.5 %. - Third order tick marks: .75 %. - Characters height for labels: 4%. - Labels offset: 1.0 %. #### Stripping Decimals. Use the `TStyle::SetStripDecimals` to strip decimals when drawing axis; labels. By default, the option is set to true, and `TGaxis::PaintAxis`; removes trailing zeros after the dot in the axis labels, e.g. {0, 0.5,; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc.}. ``` {.cpp}; TStyle::SetStripDecimals (Bool_t strip=kTRUE); ```. If this function is called with `strip=kFALSE`, `TGaxis::PaintAxis()`; will draw labels with the same number of digits after the dot, e.g.; {0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc.}. #### Optional Grid. `chopt = 'W'`: cross-Wire. #### Axis Binning Optimization. By default, the axis binning is optimized. - `chopt = 'N'`: No binning optimization. - `chopt = 'I'`: Integer labeling. ### Axis with Time Units. Histograms' axis can be defined as ""time axis"". To do that it is enough; to activate the `SetTimeDisplay` attribute on a given axis. If `h` is a; histogram, it is done the following way:. ``` {.cpp}; h->GetXaxis()->SetTimeDisplay(1); // X axis is a time axis; ```. Two parameters can be adjusted in order to define time axis: the time; format and the time offset. #### Time Format. It defines the format of the labels along the time axis. It can be; changed using the **`TAxis`** method `SetTimeFormat`. The time format is; the one used by the C function `strftime()`. It is a string containing; the following formatting characters:. +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+; | For the date: | %a abbreviated weekday name |; | | |; | | %b abbreviated month name |; | | |; | | %d day of the month (01-31) |; | | |; | | %m month (01-12) |; | | |; | | %y year without century |; | |",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:58215,optimiz,optimization,58215,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"ripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm. By default, clang will generate profile data by compiling a simple; hello world program. You can also tell clang use an external; project for generating profile data that may be a better fit for your; use case. The project you specify must either be a lit test suite; (use the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DATA option) or a CMake project (use the; CLANG_PERF_TRAINING",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst:5572,cache,caches,5572,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,1,['cache'],['caches']

You should also write code for a subclass of the; ``TargetSubtarget`` class, which allows you to use the ``-mcpu=`` and; ``-mattr=`` command-line options. * Optionally, add JIT support and create a machine code emitter (subclass of; ``TargetJITInfo``) that is used to emit binary code directly into memory. In the ``.cpp`` and ``.h``. files, initially stub up these methods and then; implement them later. Initially, you may not know which private members that; the class will need and which components will need to be subclassed. Preliminaries; -------------. To actually create your compiler backend, you need to create and modify a few; files. The absolute minimum is discussed here. But to actually use the LLVM; target-independent code generator, you must perform the steps described in the; :doc:`LLVM Target-Independent Code Generator <CodeGenerator>` document. First, you should create a subdirectory under ``lib/Target`` to hold all the; files related to your target. If your target is called ""Dummy"", create the; directory ``lib/Target/Dummy``. In this new directory, create a ``CMakeLists.txt``. It is easiest to copy a; ``CMakeLists.txt`` of another target and modify it. It should at least contain; the ``LLVM_TARGET_DEFINITIONS`` variable. The library can be named ``LLVMDummy``; (for example, see the MIPS target). Alternatively, you can split the library; into ``LLVMDummyCodeGen`` and ``LLVMDummyAsmPrinter``, the latter of which; should be implemented in a subdirectory below ``lib/Target/Dummy`` (for example,; see the PowerPC target). Note that these two naming schemes are hardcoded into ``llvm-config``.

Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers). Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions.

It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory.

Performance,"rn a matrix, return a TMatrixTLazy object instead. The; conversion is completely transparent to the end user, e.g.; ""TMatrixT m = THaarMatrixT(5);"" and _is_ efficient. Since TMatrixT et al. are fully integrated in %ROOT, they of course; can be stored in a %ROOT database. ### How to efficiently use this package. #### 1. Never return complex objects (matrices or vectors); Danger: For example, when the following snippet:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD foo(int n); {; TMatrixD foom(n,n); fill_in(foom); return foom;; }; TMatrixD m = foo(5);; ~~~. runs, it constructs matrix foo:foom, copies it onto stack as a; return value and destroys foo:foom. Return value (a matrix); from foo() is then copied over to m (via a copy constructor),; and the return value is destroyed. So, the matrix constructor is; called 3 times and the destructor 2 times. For big matrices,; the cost of multiple constructing/copying/destroying of objects; may be very large. *Some* optimized compilers can cut down on 1; copying/destroying, but still it leaves at least two calls to; the constructor. Note, TMatrixDLazy (see below) can construct; TMatrixD m ""inplace"", with only a _single_ call to the; constructor. #### 2. Use ""two-address instructions"". ~~~ {.cpp}; void TMatrixD::operator += (const TMatrixD &B);; ~~~. as much as possible.; That is, to add two matrices, it's much more efficient to write. ~~~ {.cpp}; A += B;; ~~~. than. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD C = A + B;; ~~~. (if both operand should be preserved, `TMatrixD C = A; C += B;`; is still better). #### 3. Use glorified constructors when returning of an object seems inevitable:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD A(TMatrixD::kTransposed,B);; TMatrixD C(A,TMatrixD::kTransposeMult,B);; ~~~. like in the following snippet (from `$ROOTSYS/test/vmatrix.cxx`); that verifies that for an orthogonal matrix T, T'T = TT' = E. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD haar = THaarMatrixD(5);; TMatrixD unit(TMatrixD::kUnit,haar);; TMatrixD haar_t(TMatrixD::kTransposed,haar);; TMatrixD hth(haar,TMatrixD::kTranspos",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md:15443,optimiz,optimized,15443,math/matrix/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"rn values; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A method or function which returns a retainable object type but does not return; a retained value must ensure that the object is still valid across the return; boundary. When returning from such a function or method, ARC retains the value at the; point of evaluation of the return statement, then leaves all local scopes, and; then balances out the retain while ensuring that the value lives across the; call boundary. In the worst case, this may involve an ``autorelease``, but; callers must not assume that the value is actually in the autorelease pool. ARC performs no extra mandatory work on the caller side, although it may elect; to do something to shorten the lifetime of the returned value. .. admonition:: Rationale. It is common in non-ARC code to not return an autoreleased value; therefore; the convention does not force either path. It is convenient to not be; required to do unnecessary retains and autoreleases; this permits; optimizations such as eliding retain/autoreleases when it can be shown that; the original pointer will still be valid at the point of return. A method or function may be marked with; ``__attribute__((ns_returns_autoreleased))`` to indicate that it returns a; pointer which is guaranteed to be valid at least as long as the innermost; autorelease pool. There are no additional semantics enforced in the definition; of such a method; it merely enables optimizations in callers. .. _arc.objects.operands.casts:. Bridged casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A :arc-term:`bridged cast` is a C-style cast annotated with one of three; keywords:. * ``(__bridge T) op`` casts the operand to the destination type ``T``. If; ``T`` is a retainable object pointer type, then ``op`` must have a; non-retainable pointer type. If ``T`` is a non-retainable pointer type,; then ``op`` must have a retainable object pointer type. Otherwise the cast; is ill-formed. There is no transfer of ownership, and ARC inserts no retain; operations.; * ``(__bridge_ret",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:22280,optimiz,optimizations,22280,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Performance,"routine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread. When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This; thread is called the initial thread or the main thread. The initial; thread executes the main routine in multi-threaded programs. Note: At the end of this chapter is a glossary of thread specific terms. ## Implementation of Threads in ROOT. The **`TThread`** class has been developed to provide a platform; independent interface to threads for ROOT. ### Installation. For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version; of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations.; We hope that this will become the default later. To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):. ```; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; ```. This configures and builds ROOT using `/usr/lib/libpthread.so` as the; `Pthread` library, and defines `R__THREAD`. This enables the thread specific treatment of *`gPad`*, and creates; `$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.`. Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate; ROOT keyword for your platform. ### Classes. **`TThread`** class implements threads .

For more on the philosophy behind LLVM debugging information, see; :doc:`SourceLevelDebugging`. Rules for updating debug locations; ==================================. .. _WhenToPreserveLocation:. When to preserve an instruction location; ----------------------------------------. A transformation should preserve the debug location of an instruction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instruction should be the same; as the location of the ``add`` instruction. * Tail duplication. For example, if blocks ``B1`` and ``B2`` both; unconditionally branch to ``B3`` and ``B3`` can be folded into its; predecessors, sourc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst:1196,optimiz,optimizations,1196,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

In other words, the pointee type carries no real; semantics. Historically LLVM was some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size.

In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice).

Performance,"rves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps.

To configure a single-stage build that builds LLVM/Clang and then optimizes; it with BOLT, use the following CMake configuration:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake <path to source>/llvm -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/BOLT.cmake. Then, build the BOLT-optimized binary by running the following ninja command:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja clang-bolt. If you're seeing errors in the build process, try building with a recent; version of Clang/LLVM by setting the CMAKE_C_COMPILER and; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER flags to the appropriate values. It is also possible to use BOLT on top of PGO and (Thin)LTO for an even more; significant runtime speedup. To configure a three stage PGO build with ThinLTO; that optimizes the resulting binary with BOLT, use the following CMake; configuration command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja <path to source>/llvm \; -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/BOLT-PGO.cmake \; -DBOOTSTRAP_LLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON \; -DBOOTSTRAP_BOOTSTRAP_LLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin.

In the ancient lore of compilers non-determinism is like the multi-headed hydra.; Whenever its head pops up, terror and chaos ensue. Historically one of the tests to verify that a compiler was deterministic would; be a three stage build. The idea of a three stage build is you take your sources; and build a compiler (stage1), then use that compiler to rebuild the sources; (stage2), then you use that compiler to rebuild the sources a third time; (stage3) with an identical configuration to the stage2 build. At the end of; this, you have a stage2 and stage3 compiler that should be bit-for-bit; identical.

Performance,"ry general and powerful way of processing a `TChain` is; provided via the method `TChain::Process()`. This method takes as; arguments an instance of a -- user-implemented-- class of type; `TSelector`, and -- optionally -- the number of entries and the first; entry to be processed. A template for the class `TSelector` is provided; by the method `TTree::MakeSelector`, as is shown in the little macro; `makeSelector.C` below. It opens the n-tuple `conductivity_experiment.root` from the example; above and creates from it the header file `MySelector.h` and a template; to insert your own analysis code, `MySelector.C`.; \newpage. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/makeMySelector.C; ```. The template contains the entry points `Begin()` and `SlaveBegin()`; called before processing of the `TChain` starts, `Process()` called for; every entry of the chain, and `SlaveTerminate()` and `Terminate()`; called after the last entry has been processed. Typically,; initialization like booking of histograms is performed in; `SlaveBegin()`, the analysis, i.e. the selection of entries,; calculations and filling of histograms, is done in `Process()`, and; final operations like plotting and storing of results happen in; `SlaveTerminate()` or `Terminate()`. The entry points `SlaveBegin()` and `SlaveTerminate()` are called on; so-called slave nodes only if parallel processing via `PROOF` or; `PROOF lite` is enabled, as will be explained below.

This function will use the least significant; two bits of integer argument to set the floating point rounding mode. .. code-block:: c++. double __builtin_setrnd(int mode);. The effective values for mode are:. - 0 - round to nearest; - 1 - round to zero; - 2 - round to +infinity; - 3 - round to -infinity. Note that the mode argument will modulo 4, so if the integer argument is greater; than 3, it will only use the least significant two bits of the mode.; Namely, ``__builtin_setrnd(102))`` is equal to ``__builtin_setrnd(2)``. PowerPC cache builtins; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The PowerPC architecture specifies instructions implementing cache operations.; Clang provides builtins that give direct programmer access to these cache; instructions. Currently the following builtins are implemented in clang:. ``__builtin_dcbf`` copies the contents of a modified block from the data cache; to main memory and flushes the copy from the data cache. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __dcbf(const void* addr); /* Data Cache Block Flush */. **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c. int a = 1;; __builtin_dcbf (&a);.

[Liveness analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_variable_analysis) is a; generalization of this idea, which is often used to answer many related; questions, for example:. * finding dead stores,; * finding uninitialized variables,; * finding a good point to deallocate memory,; * finding out if it would be safe to move an object. ## Example: definitive initialization. Definitive initialization proves that variables are known to be initialized when; read. If we find a variable which is read when not initialized then we generate; a warning. ```c++; void Init() {; int x; // x is uninitialized; if (cond()) {; x = 10; // x is initialized; } else {; x = 20; // x is initialized; }; print(x); // x is initialized; }; ```. ```c++; void Uninit() {; int x; // x is uninitialized; if (cond()) {; x = 10; // x is initialized; }; print(x); // x is maybe uninitialized, x is being read, report a bug.; }; ```.

The `Streamer` decomposes the objects into data members and writes them; to a buffer. It does not write the buffer to a file, it simply populates; a buffer with bytes representing the object. This allows us to write the; buffer to a file or do anything else we could do with the buffer. For; example, we can write it to a socket to send it over the network. This; is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize; the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its; use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a; class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved. The `TObject::Write` method does the following:. - Creates a **`TKey`** object in the current directory. - Creates a **`TBuffer`** object which is part of the newly created; **`TKey`**. - Fills the **`TBuffer`** with a call to the `class::Streamer` method. - Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed. - Reserves space by scanning the **`TFree`** list. At this point, the; size of the buffer is known. - Writes the buffer to the file. - Releases the **`TBuffer`** part of the key. In other words, the `TObject::Write` calls the `Streamer` method of the; class to build the buffer. The buffer is in the key and the key is; written to disk. Once written to disk the memory consumed by the buffer; part is released. The key part of the **`TKey`** is kept. ![A diagram of a streamed TH1F in the buffer](pictures/020000EB.jpg). The key consumes about 60 bytes, whereas the buffer, since it contains; the object data, can be very large. ### Ignore Ob",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:51753,load,loaded,51753,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['load'],['loaded']
Performance,"s allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the shared object is lazily loaded. Phase 2 : Symbol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``. Next the linker invokes the LLVM; optimizer and code generators using ``lto_codegen_compile()`` which returns a; native object file creating by merging the LLVM bitcode files and applying; various optimization passes. Phase 4 : Symbol Resolution after optimization; ----------------------------------------------. In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:7172,optimiz,optimizer,7172,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimizer']"

A; minor version increment is for added functionality, and patch version; increments are for bugfixes. Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports; ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no; impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables. Using the profiling runtime without static initializers; =======================================================. By default the compiler runtime uses a static initializer to determine the; profile output path and to register a writer function. To collect profiles; without using static initializers, do this manually:. * Export a ``int __llvm_profile_runtime`` symbol from each instrumented shared; library and executable. When the linker finds a definition of this symbol, it; knows to skip loading the object which contains the profiling runtime's; static initializer. * Forward-declare ``void __llvm_profile_initialize_file(void)`` and call it; once from each instrumented executable.

In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load.

In addition, there are already multiple LLVM mirrors on GitHub, indicating that; part of our community has already settled there. On Managing Revision Numbers with Git; -------------------------------------.

Performance,"s byref, sret, inalloca and preallocated.; * Some intrinsics require an ``elementtype`` attribute, which can be retrieved; using ``getParamElementType()``. This attribute is required in cases where; the intrinsic does not naturally encode a needed element type. This is also; used for inline assembly. Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------. Frontends need to be adjusted to track pointee types independently of LLVM,; insofar as they are necessary for lowering. For example, clang now tracks the; pointee type in the ``Address`` structure.

In this case the object header; will be inspected to determine both the format and architecture. .. _jit_linking:. JIT Linking; ===========. The JIT linker concept was introduced in LLVM's earlier generation of JIT APIs,; MCJIT. In MCJIT the *RuntimeDyld* component enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage.

If a cached object image cannot be retrieved, MCJIT will; call its emitObject method. MCJIT::emitObject uses a local PassManager; instance and creates a new ObjectBufferStream instance, both of which it; passes to TargetMachine::addPassesToEmitMC before calling PassManager::run; on the Module with which it was created. .. image:: MCJIT-load.png. The PassManager::run call causes the MC code generation mechanisms to emit; a complete relocatable binary object image (either in either ELF or MachO; format, depending on the target) into the ObjectBufferStream object, which; is flushed to complete the process. If an ObjectCache is being used, the; image will be passed to the ObjectCache here.

The purpose of a JIT compiler is to compile code ""on-the-fly"" as it is needed,; rather than compiling whole programs to disk ahead of time as a traditional; compiler does. To support that aim our initial, bare-bones JIT API will have; just two functions:. 1. ``Error addModule(std::unique_ptr<Module> M)``: Make the given IR module; available for execution.; 2. ``Expected<ExecutorSymbolDef> lookup()``: Search for pointers to; symbols (functions or variables) that have been added to the JIT. A basic use-case for this API, executing the 'main' function from a module,; will look like:. .. code-block:: c++. JIT J;; J.addModule(buildModule());; auto *Main = J.lookup(""main"").getAddress().toPtr<int(*)(int, char *[])>();; int Result = Main();. The APIs that we build in these tutorials will all be variations on this simple; theme. Behind this API we will refine the implementation of the JIT to add; support for concurrent compilation, optimization and lazy compilation.; Eventually we will extend the API itself to allow higher-level program; representations (e.g. ASTs) to be added to the JIT. KaleidoscopeJIT; ===============. In the previous section we described our API, now we examine a simple; implementation of it: The KaleidoscopeJIT class [1]_ that was used in the; `Implementing a language with LLVM <LangImpl01.html>`_ tutorials. We will use; the REPL code from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of that tutorial to supply the; input for our JIT: Each time the user enters an expression the REPL will add a; new IR module containing the code for that expression to the JIT. If the; expression is a top-level expression like '1+1' or 'sin(x)', the REPL will also; use the lookup method of our JIT class find and execute the code for the; expression. In later chapters of this tutorial we will modify the REPL to enable; new interactions with our JIT class, but for now we will take this setup",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst:3516,concurren,concurrent,3516,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst,2,"['concurren', 'optimiz']","['concurrent', 'optimization']"

Performance,"s from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice.

While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate.

It is undefined behavior to perform an operation with weak; assignment semantics with a pointer to an Objective-C object whose class does; not support ``__weak`` references. .. admonition:: Rationale. Historically, it has been possible for a class to provide its own; reference-count implementation by overriding ``retain``, ``release``, etc.; However, weak references to an object require coordination with its class's; reference-count implementation because, among other things, weak loads and; stores must be atomic with respect to the final release. Therefore, existing; custom reference-count implementations will generally not support weak; references without additional effort. This is unavoidable without breaking; binary compatibility. A class may indicate that it does not support weak references by providing the; ``objc_arc_weak_reference_unavailable`` attribute on the class's interface declaration. A; retainable object pointer type is **weak-unavailable** if; is a pointer to an (optionally protocol-qualified) Objective-C class ``T`` where; ``T`` or one of its superclasses has the ``objc_arc_weak_reference_unavailable``; attribute. A program is ill-formed if it applies the ``__weak`` ownership; qualifier to a weak-unavailable type or if the value operand of a weak; assignment operation has a weak-unavailable type. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.autoreleasing:.

Performance,"s in the set"". The; choice of constraint is made independently for each constraint in the; constraint list. 2) Use ""``|``"" between constraint code sets, creating alternatives. Every; constraint in the constraint list must have the same number of alternative; sets. With this syntax, the same alternative in *all* of the items in the; constraint list will be chosen together. Putting those together, you might have a two operand constraint string like; ``""rm|r,ri|rm""``. This indicates that if operand 0 is ``r`` or ``m``, then; operand 1 may be one of ``r`` or ``i``. If operand 0 is ``r``, then operand 1; may be one of ``r`` or ``m``. But, operand 0 and 1 cannot both be of type m. However, the use of either of the alternatives features is *NOT* recommended, as; LLVM is not able to make an intelligent choice about which one to use. (At the; point it currently needs to choose, not enough information is available to do so; in a smart way.) Thus, it simply tries to make a choice that's most likely to; compile, not one that will be optimal performance. (e.g., given ""``rm``"", it'll; always choose to use memory, not registers). And, if given multiple registers,; or multiple register classes, it will simply choose the first one. (In fact, it; doesn't currently even ensure explicitly specified physical registers are; unique, so specifying multiple physical registers as alternatives, like; ``{r11}{r12},{r11}{r12}``, will assign r11 to both operands, not at all what was; intended.).

LLVM's support is often implemented on an 'as-needed' basis, to support C; inline asm code which was supported by GCC. A mismatch in behavior between LLVM; and GCC likely indicates a bug in LLVM.

Performance,"s in; each `FUNCTION_BLOCK`_. In version 0, each value defined by an instruction is assigned an ID; unique to the function. Function-level value IDs are assigned starting from; ``NumModuleValues`` since they share the same namespace as module-level; values. The value enumerator resets after each function. When a value is; an operand of an instruction, the value ID is used to represent the operand.; For large functions or large modules, these operand values can be large. The encoding in version 1 attempts to avoid large operand values; in common cases. Instead of using the value ID directly, operands are; encoded as relative to the current instruction. Thus, if an operand; is the value defined by the previous instruction, the operand; will be encoded as 1. For example, instead of. .. code-block:: none. #n = load #n-1; #n+1 = icmp eq #n, #const0; br #n+1, label #(bb1), label #(bb2). version 1 will encode the instructions as. .. code-block:: none. #n = load #1; #n+1 = icmp eq #1, (#n+1)-#const0; br #1, label #(bb1), label #(bb2). Note in the example that operands which are constants also use; the relative encoding, while operands like basic block labels; do not use the relative encoding. Forward references will result in a negative value.; This can be inefficient, as operands are normally encoded; as unsigned VBRs. However, forward references are rare, except in the; case of phi instructions. For phi instructions, operands are encoded as; `Signed VBRs`_ to deal with forward references. In version 2, the meaning of module records ``FUNCTION``, ``GLOBALVAR``,; ``ALIAS``, ``IFUNC`` and ``COMDAT`` change such that the first two operands; specify an offset and size of a string in a string table (see `STRTAB_BLOCK; Contents`_), the function name is removed from the ``FNENTRY`` record in the; value symbol table, and the top-level ``VALUE_SYMTAB_BLOCK`` may only contain; ``FNENTRY`` records.

When to specify alignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores.

To track SSA; values through compilation, when objects are promoted to SSA values an; ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic is created for each assignment, recording the; variable's new location. Compared with the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic:. * A dbg.value terminates the effect of any preceding dbg.values for (any; overlapping fragments of) the specified variable.; * The dbg.value's position in the IR defines where in the instruction stream; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value. Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer.

During the CTU analysis of certain projects, we recognized; that there are global declarations which collide with declarations from other; translation units, but they are not referenced outside from their translation; unit.

Note, the; feature be able to choose between name conflict handling strategies is still an; ongoing work. .. _CFG:. The ``CFG`` class; -----------------. The ``CFG`` class is designed to represent a source-level control-flow graph; for a single statement (``Stmt*``). Typically instances of ``CFG`` are; constructed for function bodies (usually an instance of ``CompoundStmt``), but; can also be instantiated to represent the control-flow of any class that; subclasses ``Stmt``, which includes simple expressions. Control-flow graphs; are especially useful for performing `flow- or path-sensitive; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_analysis#Sensitivities>`_ program; analyses on a given function. Basic Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Concretely, an instance of ``CFG`` is a collection of basic blocks. Each basic; block is an instance of ``CFGBlock``, which simply contains an ordered sequence; of ``Stmt*`` (each referring to statements in the AST). The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface. A ``CFG`` object owns the instances of ``CFGBlock`` within the control-flow; graph it represents. Each ``CFGBlock`` within a CFG is also uniquely numbered; (accessible via ``CFGBlock::getBlockID()``).

Performance,"s nice. **Gabor:**. At this point, I am a bit wondering about two questions. * When should something belong to a checker and when should something belong to the engine?; Sometimes we model library aspects in the engine and model language constructs in checkers. * What is the checker programming model that we are aiming for? Maximum freedom or more easy checker development?. I think if we aim for maximum freedom, we do not need to worry about the; potential stress on checkers, and we can introduce abstractions to mitigate that; later on.; If we want to simplify the API, then maybe it makes more sense to move language; construct modeling to the engine when the checker API is not sufficient instead; of complicating the API. Right now I have no preference or objections between the alternatives but there; are some random thoughts:. * Maybe it would be great to have a guideline how to evolve the analyzer and; follow it, so it can help us to decide in similar situations. * I do care about performance in this case. The reason is that we have a; limited performance budget. And I think we should not expect most of the checker; writers to add modeling of language constructs. So, in my opinion, it is ok to; have less nice/more verbose API for language modeling if we can have better; performance this way, since it only needs to be done once, and is done by the; framework developers. **Artem:** These are some great questions, i guess it'd be better to discuss; them more openly. As a quick dump of my current mood:. * To me it seems obvious that we need to aim for a checker API that is both; simple and powerful. This can probably by keeping the API as powerful as; necessary while providing a layer of simple ready-made solutions on top of it.; Probably a few reusable components for assembling checkers.

If the base class or data member is itself a class, then there will; also be a streamerinfo object in the record for that class. In this way, each; class is recursively decomposed into its atomic elements, each of which is a simple; type (e.g. ""int""). A ""long"" or ""unsigned long"" member is always written; as an 8 byte quantity, even if it occupies only 4 bytes in memory. A data member of a class is marked transient on the line of its declaration by a; comment beginning with ""//!"". Such members are not written to disk, nor is there; any streamerinfo for such a member. A data member that is a C++ pointer (not to be confused with ""pointers to persistent; objects"" described below) is never written to disk as a pointer value. If it is a; pointer to an object, the object itself (or 0 (4 bytes) if the pointer value is NULL); is written. If the declaration line has a comment beginning with ""//->"", this indicates; that the pointer value will never be null, which allows a performance optimization.; Another optimization is that if two or more pointers pointing to the same object are; streamed in the same I/O operation, the object is written only once. The remaining; pointers reference the object through a unique object identifier. This saves space; and avoids the infinite loop that might otherwise arise if the directed graph of object; instance pointer references contains a cycle.

Performance,"s section we only mention loads. Stores have exactly the same problems as their associated loads, so have been skipped for brevity. Considerations; ==============. LLVM IR Lane ordering; ---------------------. LLVM IR has first class vector types. In LLVM IR, the zero'th element of a vector resides at the lowest memory address. The optimizer relies on this property in certain areas, for example when concatenating vectors together. The intention is for arrays and vectors to have identical memory layouts - ``[4 x i8]`` and ``<4 x i8>`` should be represented the same in memory. Without this property there would be many special cases that the optimizer would have to cleverly handle. Use of ``LDR`` would break this lane ordering property. This doesn't preclude the use of ``LDR``, but we would have to do one of two things:. 1. Insert a ``REV`` instruction to reverse the lane order after every ``LDR``.; 2. Disable all optimizations that rely on lane layout, and for every access to an individual lane (``insertelement``/``extractelement``/``shufflevector``) reverse the lane index. AAPCS; -----. The ARM procedure call standard (AAPCS) defines the ABI for passing vectors between functions in registers. It states:. When a short vector is transferred between registers and memory it is treated as an opaque object. That is a short vector is stored in memory as if it were stored with a single ``STR`` of the entire register; a short vector is loaded from memory using the corresponding ``LDR`` instruction. On a little-endian system this means that element 0 will always contain the lowest addressed element of a short vector; on a big-endian system element 0 will contain the highest-addressed element of a short vector. -- Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), 4.1.2 Short Vectors.

Performance,"s some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size. This causes lots of redundant no-op bitcasts; in the IR to and from a pointer with a different pointee type. No-op bitcasts take up memory/disk space and also take up compile time to look; through. However, perhaps the biggest issue is the code complexity required ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:2915,optimiz,optimizations,2915,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"s space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation. As an exception to the preceding rule, the compiler may not assume execution; will continue after a volatile store operation. This restriction is necessary; to support the somewhat common pattern in C of intentionally storing to an; invalid pointer to crash the program. In the future, it might make sense to; allow frontends to control this behavior. IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into llvm.memcpy; or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are flagged volatile.; Likewise, the backend should never split or merge target-legal volatile; load/store instructions. Similarly, IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot; change from integer to floating-point or vice versa. .. admonition:: Rationale. Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported; data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C; this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native; hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types. The; frontend upholds these expectations, which are intentionally; unspecified in the IR. The rules above ensure that IR transformations; do not violate the frontend's contract with the language. .. _memmodel:. Memory Model for Concurrent Operations; --------------------------------------. The LLVM IR does not define any way to start parallel threads of; execution or to register signal handlers. Nonetheless, there are; platform-specific ways to create them, and we define LLVM IR's behavior; in their presence. This model is inspired by the C++ memory model. For a more informal introduction to this model, see the :doc:`Atomics`. We define a *happens",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:148142,load,loads,148142,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

This doesn't fully enforce all inter-library dependencies, and importantly; doesn't enforce header file circular dependencies created by inline functions.; A good way to answer the ""is this layered correctly"" would be to consider; whether a Unix linker would succeed at linking the program if all inline; functions were defined out-of-line. (& for all valid orderings of dependencies; - since linking resolution is linear, it's possible that some implicit; dependencies can sneak through: A depends on B and C, so valid orderings are; ""C B A"" or ""B C A"", in both cases the explicit dependencies come before their; use.

In these cases go ahead and ``#include`` that header file. Be; aware however that there are many cases where you don't need to have the full; definition of a class. If you are using a pointer or reference to a class, you; don't need the header file. If you are simply returning a class instance from a; prototyped function or method, you don't need it. In fact, for most cases, you; simply don't need the definition of a class. And not ``#include``\ing speeds up; compilation. It is easy to try to go too overboard on this recommendation, however. You; **must** include all of the header files that you are using --- you can include; them either directly or indirectly through another header file.

This requires a change in the on file format used to store this type; of data members (i.e. by adding inline the version number of the class; 'Data'). To read file containing this construct and written with this revision; using an older version of ROOT you will need the following patches:; For v5.22/00, you will need the patch r33174; or v5.22/00k; For v5.26/00, you will need patch r33176; or v5.26/00c. Additionally, we no longer allow the member wise streaming of a class which; has a custom streamer nor of any data members marked with //||. Run time performance. We introduced an optimized infrastructure for reading objects using a StreamerInfo. Rather than driving the streaming using a switch statement inside TStreamerInfo::ReadBuffer,; the streaming is now driven using a simple loop over a sequence of configured StreamerInfo actions. This improves run-time performance by allowing a dramatic reduction in function calls and code; branches at the expense of some code duplication. There are 3 versions of this loop implemented in TBufferFile and overloaded in TBufferXML and TBufferSQL:. virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence, void *object);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);. The 1st version is optimized to read a single object. The 2nd version is optimized to read the content of TClonesArrays and vectors of pointers to objects. The 3rd version is used to streamed any collections. TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.).

When required, the declarations; stored within a declaration context will be deserialized. There are two; representations of the declarations within a declaration context, which; correspond to the name-lookup and iteration behavior described above:. * When the front end performs name lookup to find a name ``x`` within a given; declaration context (for example, during semantic analysis of the expression; ``p->x``, where ``p``'s type is defined in the precompiled header), Clang; refers to an on-disk hash table that maps from the names within that; declaration context to the declaration IDs that represent each visible; declaration with that name. The actual declarations will then be; deserialized to provide the results of name lookup.; * When the front end performs iteration over all of the declarations within a; declaration context, all of those declarations are immediately; de-serialized. For large declaration contexts (e.g., the translation unit),; this operation is expensive; however, large declaration contexts are not; traversed in normal compilation, since such a traversal is unnecessary.; However, it is common for the code generator and semantic analysis to; traverse declaration contexts for structs, classes, unions, and; enumerations, although those contexts contain relatively few declarations in; the common case.

Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken.

Threads execute independently.; All threads in a given process share the private address space of that; process. **`Concurrency`** exists when at least two threads are in progress at; the same time. A system with only a single processor can support; concurrency by switching execution contexts among multiple threads. **`Parallelism`** arises when at least two threads are executing; simultaneously.

Cling commands start with ""`.`"". ``` {.cpp}; root[] .? //this command will list all the Cling commands; root[] .L <filename> //load [filename]; root[] .x <filename> //load and execute [filename]; ```. 2. SHELL commands start with ""`.!`"" for example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .! ls; ```. 3. C++ commands follow C++ syntax (almost). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser(); ```. ### Multi-line Commands. You can use the command line to execute multi-line commands.

When instructions are executed, the retire control unit flags the instruction as; ""ready to retire."". Instructions are retired in program order. The register file is notified of the; retirement so that it can free the physical registers that were allocated for; the instruction during the register renaming stage. Load/Store Unit and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other.

Although the two examples have inconsistent optimization and debugging level, both of them are accepted. Note that **currently** the compiler doesn't consider inconsistent macro definition a problem.

Performance,"s, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute. Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions. It means exactly what its name implies: a function; with a 'noreturn' attribute should never return.; Specific details of the syntax of using the 'noreturn' attribute can be found; in GCC's; documentation.; Not only does the analyzer exploit this information when pruning false paths,; but the compiler also takes it seriously and will generate different code (and; possibly better optimized) under the assumption that the function does not; return.; Example; On Mac OS X, the function prototype for __assert_rtn (declared in; assert.h) is specifically annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute:. void __assert_rtn(const char *, const char *, int, const char *) __attribute__((__noreturn__));.

Performance,"s, buffers, and; leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is; important to realize that each object is not written individually, but; rather collected and written a bunch at a time. This is where the **`TTree`** takes advantage of compression and will; produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written; individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the; **`TTree`** contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects; can be compressed. The **`TTree`** reduces the header of each object, but it still contains; the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class; object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression; algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using; a **`TTree`** and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes; compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned; off, you will not see these large savings. The **`TTree`** is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a; hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from; any other branch. Now, assume that `Px` and `Py` are data members of the; event, and we would like to compute `Px2 + Py2` for every event; and histogram the result. If we had saved the million events without a **`TTree`** we would have; to:. - read each event in its entirety into memory; - extract the `Px` and `Py` from the event; - compute the sum of the squares; - fill a histogram. We would have to do that a million times! This is very time consuming,; and we really do not need to read the entire event, every time. All we; need are two little data members (`Px` and `Py`). On the other hand, if; we use a tree with one branch containing `Px` and another branch; containing `Py`, we can read all values of `Px` and `Py` by only reading; the `Px` and `Py` branches.

Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time. Explicitly, users should not rely on; the produced bitcode or object code to match their non-LTO counterparts; precisely. They will exhibit similar performance characteristics, but may; not be bit-for-bit the same. Internally, the ``.llvm.lto`` section is created by running the; ``EmbedBitcodePass`` after the ``ThinLTOPreLinkDefaultPipeline``. This pass is; responsible for emitting the ``.llvm.lto`` section. Afterwards, the; ``ThinLTODefaultPipeline`` runs and the compiler can emit the fat object file. Limitations; ===========. Linkers; -------.

Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:.

If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory.

Performance,"s. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op. All of the semantics described in this document are subject to additional; :ref:`optimization rules <arc.optimization>` which permit the removal or; optimization of operations based on local knowledge of data flow.

Performance,"s. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors. There are additional areas that LLVM does not directly address:. * Registration of global roots with the runtime. * Registration of stack map entries with the runtime. * The functions used by the program to allocate memory, trigger a collection,; etc. * Computation or compilation of type maps, or registration of them with the; runtime. These are used to crawl the heap for object references. In general, LLVM's support for GC does not include features which can be; adequately addressed with other features of the IR and does not specify a; particular binary interface. On the plus side, this means that you should be; able to integrate LLVM with an existing runtime. On the other hand, it can; have the effect of leaving a lot of work for the developer of a novel; language.

FAQs; ====. Required passes; ---------------. A pass that defines a static ``isRequired()`` method that returns true is a required pass. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class HelloWorldPass : public PassInfoMixin<HelloWorldPass> {; public:; PreservedAnalyses run(Function &F, FunctionAnalysisManager &AM);. static bool isRequired() { return true; }; };. A required pass is a pass that may not be skipped. An example of a required; pass is ``AlwaysInlinerPass``, which must always be run to preserve; ``alwaysinline`` semantics. Pass managers are required since they may contain; other required passes. An example of how a pass can be skipped is the ``optnone`` function; attribute, which specifies that optimizations should not be run on the; function. Required passes will still be run on ``optnone`` functions. For more implementation details, see; ``PassInstrumentation::runBeforePass()``. Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryI",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.rst:7113,optimiz,optimizations,7113,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:5272,optimiz,optimization,5272,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"s; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken.

The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_regx R; DW_OP_deref_type; DR``. .. note::. Should DWARF allow the type T to be a larger size than the size of the; register R? Restricting a larger bit size avoids any issue of conversion; as the, possibly truncated, bit contents of the register is simply; interpreted as a value of T. If a conversion is wanted it can be done; explicitly using a ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a; register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers.; Removing use of the target hook does not cause any test failures in common; architectures. If the compiler for a target architecture did want some; form of conversion, including a larger result type, it could always; explicitly use the ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. If T is a larger type than the register size, then the default GDB; register hook reads bytes from the next register (or reads out of bounds; for the last register!).

The **`TGeoManager`** class contains the API for accessing and handling; defined materials:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoManager::GetMaterial(name);; ```. ## Shapes. Shapes are geometrical objects that provide the basic modeling; functionality. They provide the definition of the `local` coordinate; system of the volume. Any volume must have a shape. Any shape recognized; by the modeller has to derive from the base **`TGeoShape`** class,; providing methods for:. - Finding out if a point defined in their local frame is contained or; not by the shape;; - Computing the distance to enter/exit the shape from a local point,; given a known direction;; - Computing the maximum distance in any direction from a local point; that does NOT result in a boundary crossing of the shape (safe; distance);; - Computing the cosines of the normal vector to the crossed shape; s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:22799,perform,performing,22799,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['perform'],['performing']
Performance,"s; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up and binding; the method before the loop, and discarding it afterwards. Here is an; example:. ``` {.cpp}; hpx = TH1F('hpx','px',100,-4,4); hpxFill = hpx.Fill # cache bound method; for i in xrange(25000):; px = gRandom.Gaus(); hpxFill(px) # use bound method: no lookup needed; del hpxFill # done with cached method; ```. Note that if you do not discard the bound method, a reference to the; histogram will remain outstanding, and it will not be deleted when it; should be. It is therefore important to delete the method when you're; done with it. ### Use of Python Functions. It is possible to mix Python functions with ROOT and perform such; operations as plotting and fitting of histograms with them. In all; cases, the procedure consists of instantiating a ROOT **`TF1`**,; **`TF2`**, or **`TF3`** with the Python function and working with that; ROOT object. There are some memory issues, so it is for example not yet; possible to delete a **`TF1`** instance and then create another one with; the same name. In addition, the Python function, once used for; instantiating the **`TF1`**, is never deleted. Instead of a Python function, you can also use callable instances (e.g.,; an ins",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:24515,cache,cache,24515,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

The preloading starts at the dword offset; within the kernarg segment, which is specified by the; kernarg_preload_spec_offset field. If the kernarg_preload_spec_length is non-zero, the CP firmware will append an; additional 256 bytes to the kernel_code_entry_byte_offset. This addition; facilitates the incorporation of a prologue to the kernel entry to handle cases; where code designed for kernarg preloading is executed on hardware equipped with; incompatible firmware.

If this is the case,; the modeller changes the state to point to the required object, converts; the current point and direction coordinates to the local frame of this; object and computes the distance to its shape. The node returned is the; one pointed by the input path in case the shape is crossed; otherwise; the returned value is NULL. In case the distance to next crossed; boundary is required, the current point has to be physically INSIDE the; shape pointed by the current volume. This is only insured in case a call; to TGeoManager::FindNode() was performed for the current point.; Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and; direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to; compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step.

Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only; file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the; new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::AddFriend. A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method.

All agents (GPU and CPU) access GPU memory through the MALL cache. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively.

Asking for a cached and immutable outer level IR analysis works via; ``getCachedResult()``, but getting direct access to an outer level IR analysis; manager to compute an outer level IR analysis is not allowed. This is for a; couple reasons. The first reason is that running analyses across outer level IR in inner level; IR passes can result in quadratic compile time behavior. For example, a module; analysis often scans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessary and; there isn't infrastructure for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below).

In the common case, a value is available in a register, and the; ``Offset`` field will be zero. Values spilled to the stack are encoded; as ``Indirect`` locations. The runtime must load those values from a; stack address, typically in the form ``[BP + Offset]``. If an; ``alloca`` value is passed directly to a stack map intrinsic, then; LLVM may fold the frame index into the stack map as an optimization to; avoid allocating a register or stack slot. These frame indices will be; encoded as ``Direct`` locations in the form ``BP + Offset``. LLVM may; also optimize constants by emitting them directly in the stack map,; either in the ``Offset`` of a ``Constant`` location or in the constant; pool, referred to by ``ConstantIndex`` locations. At each callsite, a ""liveout"" register list is also recorded. These; are the registers that are live across the stackmap and therefore must; be saved by the runtime. This is an important optimization when the; patchpoint intrinsic is used with a calling convention that by default; preserves most registers as callee-save. Each entry in the liveout register list contains a DWARF register; number and size in bytes. The stackmap format deliberately omits; specific subregister information. Instead the runtime must interpret; this information conservatively. For example, if the stackmap reports; one byte at ``%rax``, then the value may be in either ``%al`` or; ``%ah``. It doesn't matter in practice, because the runtime will; simply save ``%rax``. However, if the stackmap reports 16 bytes at; ``%ymm0``, then the runtime can safely optimize by saving only; ``%xmm0``.

The buffer descriptor used to construct a buffer fat pointer must be *raw*:; the stride must be 0, the ""add tid"" flag must be 0, the swizzle enable bits; must be off, and the extent must be measured in bytes. (On subtargets where; bounds checking may be disabled, buffer fat pointers may choose to enable; it or not). **Buffer Resource**; The buffer resource pointer, in address space 8, is the newer form; for representing buffer descriptors in AMDGPU IR, replacing their; previous representation as `<4 x i32>`. It is a non-integral pointer; that represents a 128-bit buffer descriptor resource (`V#`). Since, in general, a buffer resource supports complex addressing modes that cannot; be easily represented in LLVM (such as implicit swizzled access to structured; buffers), it is **illegal** to perform non-trivial address computations, such as; ``getelementptr`` operations, on buffer resources. They may be passed to; AMDGPU buffer intrinsics, and they may be converted to and from ``i128``. Casting a buffer resource to a buffer fat pointer is permitted and adds an offset; of 0. Buffer resources can be created from 64-bit pointers (which should be either; generic or global) using the `llvm.amdgcn.make.buffer.rsrc` intrinsic, which; takes the pointer, which becomes the base of the resource,; the 16-bit stride (and swzizzle control) field stored in bits `63:48` of a `V#`,; the 32-bit NumRecords/extent field (bits `95:64`), and the 32-bit flags field; (bits `127:96`). The specific interpretation of these fields varies by the; target architecture and is detailed in the ISA descriptions. **Buffer Strided Pointer**; The buffer index pointer is an experimental address space.

Instantiating the following classes and even including their header files is deprecated, and the headers will be removed in ROOT 6.34:. * RooAbsTestStatistic; * RooAbsOptTestStatistic; * RooNLLVar; * RooChi2Var; * RooXYChi2Var. Please use the higher-level functions `RooAbsPdf::createNLL()` and `RooAbsPdf::createChi2()` if you want to create objects that represent test statistics. ### Change of RooParamHistFunc. The `RooParamHistFunc` didn't take any observable `RooRealVar` as constructor; argument. It assumes as observable the internal variables in the passed; RooDataHist. This means it was in most contexts unusable, because the input; can't be changed, other than loading a different bin in the dataset. Furthermore, there was actually a constructor that took a `RooAbsArg x`, but it; was simply ignored. To fix all these problems, the existing constructors were replaced by a new one; that takes the observable explicitly. Since the old constructors resulted in wrong computation graphs that caused; trouble with the new CPU evaluation backend, they had to be removed without; deprecation. Please adapt your code if necessary. ### Renaming of some RooFit classes. The `RooPower` was renamed to `RooPowerSum`, and `RooExpPoly` was renamed to `RooLegacyExpPoly`. This was a necessary change, because the names of these classes introduced in ROOT 6.28 collided with some classes in CMS combine, which were around already long before. Therefore, the classes had to be renamed to not cause any problems for CMS.

You will also need to add code to ``PromoteOp`` to do this as; well.

Performance,"se. Describing Language Specific Properties; =======================================. When translating a source language to LLVM, finding ways to express concepts; and guarantees available in your source language which are not natively; provided by LLVM IR will greatly improve LLVM's ability to optimize your code.; As an example, C/C++'s ability to mark every add as ""no signed wrap (nsw)"" goes; a long way to assisting the optimizer in reasoning about loop induction; variables and thus generating more optimal code for loops. The LLVM LangRef includes a number of mechanisms for annotating the IR with; additional semantic information. It is *strongly* recommended that you become; highly familiar with this document. The list below is intended to highlight a; couple of items of particular interest, but is by no means exhaustive. Restricted Operation Semantics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; #. Add nsw/nuw flags as appropriate. Reasoning about overflow is; generally hard for an optimizer so providing these facts from the frontend; can be very impactful. #. Use fast-math flags on floating point operations if legal. If you don't; need strict IEEE floating point semantics, there are a number of additional; optimizations that can be performed. This can be highly impactful for; floating point intensive computations. Describing Aliasing Properties; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Add noalias/align/dereferenceable/nonnull to function arguments and return; values as appropriate. #. Use pointer aliasing metadata, especially tbaa metadata, to communicate; otherwise-non-deducible pointer aliasing facts. #. Use inbounds on geps. This can help to disambiguate some aliasing queries. Undefined Values; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use poison values instead of undef values whenever possible. #. Tag function parameters with the noundef attribute whenever possible.

One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters. A new tutorial macro rf903_numintcache.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of this feature. Representation of function and p.d.f. derivatives; A new class has been added that can represent the derivative of any p.d.f or function w.r.t. any; parameter or observable. To construct e.g. a first order derivative of a Gaussian p.d.f, do. RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ;. A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro rf111_derivatives.C. Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface. Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X.

This way, a single directory containing multiple variants of modules can be prepared and reused. The options configuring the module cache are independent of other options. Module Semantics; ================. Modules are modeled as if each submodule were a separate translation unit, and a module import makes names from the other translation unit visible. Each submodule starts with a new preprocessor state and an empty translation unit. .. note::. This behavior is currently only approximated when building a module with submodules. Entities within a submodule that has already been built are visible when building later submodules in that module. This can lead to fragile modules that depend on the build order used for the submodules of the module, and should not be relied upon. This behavior is subject to change. As an example, in C, this implies that if two structs are defined in different submodules with the same name, those two types are distinct types (but may be *compatible* types if their definitions match). In C++, two structs defined with the same name in different submodules are the *same* type, and must be equiv",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:24041,cache,cache,24041,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"setting.; Offsetting has instead been implemented in the calculators that we'll describe next.; This is one of the consequences of the conceptual splitting of functionality into statistics and calculator classes.; Offsetting is a feature of calculation in a fitting context; it enhances numerical precision by subtracting the initial likelihood value from the value that the minimizer sees, thus setting it to zero for the minimizer.; Since this does not impact the derivative terms, it does not affect the fitting result, except for added numerical precision. ## Calculators; `RooFit::TestStatistics` provides two abstract base classes for likelihood calculation: `LikelihoodWrapper` and `LikelihoodGradientWrapper`.; These are used by the `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` implementation `MinuitFcnGrad` which expects them to, respectively, provide likelihood and likelihood gradient values for use by `Minuit2` in fitting the pdf to the dataset. The `Wrapper`s can be implemented for different kinds of algorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind.; One implementation of each is ready for use in `RooFit` currently:. 1. `LikelihoodSerial` is more or less simply a rewrite of the existing serial calculation of a `RooNLLVar`.; 2. `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculates the partial derivatives or the gradient in parallel on multiple CPUs/cores, based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`, which is a fork-based multi-processing task execution framework with dynamic load balancing. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. Note: a second `LikelihoodWrapper` class called `LikelihoodJob` is also available.; This class emulates the existing `NumCPU(>1)` functionality of the `RooAbsTestStatistic` tree, which is implemented based on `RooRealMPFE`.; This class is not yet thoroughly tested and shou",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:6982,optimiz,optimization,6982,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"shelf *ORC layers*: IRCompileLayer and; ObjectLinkingLayer, to do much of the heavy lifting. In this layer we'll learn more about the ORC layer concept by using a new layer,; IRTransformLayer, to add IR optimization support to KaleidoscopeJIT. Optimizing Modules using the IRTransformLayer; =============================================. In `Chapter 4 <LangImpl04.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a language with LLVM""; tutorial series the llvm *FunctionPassManager* is introduced as a means for; optimizing LLVM IR. Interested readers may read that chapter for details, but; in short: to optimize a Module we create an llvm::FunctionPassManager; instance, configure it with a set of optimizations, then run the PassManager on; a Module to mutate it into a (hopefully) more optimized but semantically; equivalent form. In the original tutorial series the FunctionPassManager was; created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules were optimized before being; added to it. In this Chapter we will make optimization a phase of our JIT; instead. For now this will provide us a motivation to learn more about ORC; layers, but in the long term making optimization part of our JIT will yield an; important benefit: When we begin lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring; compilation of each function until the first time it's run) having; optimization managed by our JIT will allow us to optimize lazily too, rather; than having to do all our optimization up-front. To add optimization support to our JIT we will take the KaleidoscopeJIT from; Chapter 1 and compose an ORC *IRTransformLayer* on top. We will look at how the; IRTransformLayer works in more detail below, but the interface is simple: the; constructor for this layer takes a reference to the execution session and the; layer below (as all layers do) plus an *IR optimization function* that it will; apply to each Module that is added via addModule:. .. code-block:: c++. class KaleidoscopeJIT {; private:; ExecutionSession ES;; RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:2024,optimiz,optimization,2024,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

These options enable LTO and save temporary files generated during compilation; for later analysis. On Windows, you should be using lld-link as the linker. Adjust your compilation ; flags as follows:; * Add ``/lldsavetemps`` to the linker flags.; * When linking from the compiler driver, add ``/link /lldsavetemps`` in order to forward that flag to the linker. Using the specified flags will generate four intermediate bytecode files:. #. a.out.0.0.preopt.bc (Before any link-time optimizations (LTO) are applied); #. a.out.0.2.internalize.bc (After initial optimizations are applied); #. a.out.0.4.opt.bc (After an extensive set of optimizations); #. a.out.0.5.precodegen.bc (After LTO but before translating into machine code).

Recently LLVM and Clang have been adding some more complicated build system; features. Utilizing these new features often involves a complicated chain of; CMake variables passed on the command line. Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C. For more information about some of the advanced build configurations supported; via Cache files see :doc:`AdvancedBuilds`. Executing the Tests; ===================. Testing is performed when the *check-all* target is built.

If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries.

The initial parameter values can be set directly in the input model function object.; However, for setting parameter bounds and step sizes to values different than the automatically computed ones, one needs to use the `ROOT::Fit::ParameterSetting` class.; This example code will set the lower/upper bounds for the first parameter and a lower bound for the second parameter. ``` {.cpp}; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; fitter.Config().ParSettings(0).SetLimits(0,1.E6);; fitter.Config().ParSettings(2).SetLowerLimit(0);; ```. Note that a `ROOT::Fit::ParameterSettings` objects exists for each fit parameter and it created by the `ROOT::Fit::FitConfig` class, after the model function has been set in the Fitter.; Only when the function is set, the number of parameter is known and; automatically the `FitConfig` creates the corresponding `ParameterSetting` objects. When fitting, different minimizer can be used. The can be implemented in different libraries and loaded ar run time by the plug-in manager system of ROOT.; Each different minimizer (e.g. *Minuit, Minuit2, Fumili,* etc.) consists of a different implementation of the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface.; Within the same minimizer, thus within the same class implementing the `Minimizer` interface, different algorithms can exist.; For example in the case of Minuit, we have *Migrad, Simplex* or *Minimize*. The minimizer and its corresponding algorithm, when available,; can be set by using the function `FitConfig::SetMinimizer(""minimizerName"")` or by using directly the `ROOT:Math::MinimizerOptions` class. If the requested minimizer is not available in ROOT, the default one is used.

Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow dependencies. Data values are simple; edges with an integer or floating point value type. Control edges are; represented as ""chain"" edges which are of type ``MVT::Other``. These edges; provide an ordering between nodes that have side effects (such as loads, stores,; calls, returns, etc). All nodes that have side effects should take a token; chain as input and produce a new one as output. By convention, token chain; inputs are always operand #0, and chain results are always the last value; produced by an operation. However, after instruction selection, the; machine nodes have their chain after the instruction's operands, and; may be followed by glue nodes. A SelectionDAG has designated ""Entry"" and ""Root"" nodes. The Entry node is; always a marker node with an Opcode of ``ISD::EntryToken``. The Root node is; the final side-effecting node in the token chain. For example, in a single basic; block function it would be the return node. One important concept for SelectionDAGs is the notion of a ""legal"" vs.; ""illegal"" DAG. A legal DAG for a target is one that only uses supported; operations and supported types.

Performance,"skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security mo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:36037,load,load,36037,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"sky. Whether this kind of; mixture is a sufficient mitigation requires careful analysis. Unfortunately, experimental results indicate that the performance overhead of; this approach is very high for certain patterns of code. A classic example is; any form of recursive evaluation engine. The hot, rapid call and return; sequences exhibit dramatic performance loss when mitigated with `lfence`. This; component alone can regress performance by 2x or more, making it an unpleasant; tradeoff even when only used in a mixture of code. ##### Use an internal TLS location to pass predicate state. We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention. We could define a new ABI and/or calling convention to explicitly pass the; predicate state in and out of functions. This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks.

Note that this guarantee is cheap on common; platforms for loads of a native width, but can be expensive or unavailable for; wider loads, like a 64-bit store on ARM.

Reordering unordered operations is safe, though, and optimizers should; take advantage of that because unordered operations are common in languages; that need them. Notes for code generation; These operations are required to be atomic in the sense that if you use; unordered loads and unordered stores, a load cannot see a value which was; never stored. A normal load or store instruction is usually sufficient, but; note that an unordered load or store cannot be split into multiple; instructions (or an instruction which does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM).

Performance,"sociated; MaterializationResponsibility object. This object tracks the definitions; that must be materialized and provides a way to notify the JITDylib once they; are either successfully materialized or a failure occurs. Absolute Symbols, Aliases, and Reexports; ========================================. ORC makes it easy to define symbols with absolute addresses, or symbols that; are simply aliases of other symbols:. Absolute Symbols; ----------------. Absolute symbols are symbols that map directly to addresses without requiring; further materialization, for example: ""foo"" = 0x1234. One use case for; absolute symbols is allowing resolution of process symbols. E.g. .. code-block:: c++. JD.define(absoluteSymbols(SymbolMap({; { Mangle(""printf""),; { ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(&printf),; JITSymbolFlags::Callable } }; });. With this mapping established code added to the JIT can refer to printf; symbolically rather than requiring the address of printf to be ""baked in"".; This in turn allows cached versions of the JIT'd code (e.g. compiled objects); to be re-used across JIT sessions as the JIT'd code no longer changes, only the; absolute symbol definition does. For process and library symbols the DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator utility (See; :ref:`How to Add Process and Library Symbols to JITDylibs; <ProcessAndLibrarySymbols>`) can be used to automatically build absolute; symbol mappings for you. However the absoluteSymbols function is still useful; for making non-global objects in your JIT visible to JIT'd code. For example,; imagine that your JIT standard library needs access to your JIT object to make; some calls. We could bake the address of your object into the library, but then; it would need to be recompiled for each session:. .. code-block:: c++. // From standard library for JIT'd code:. class MyJIT {; public:; void log(const char *Msg);; };. void log(const char *Msg) { ((MyJIT*)0x1234)->log(Msg); }. We can turn this into a symbolic reference in the JIT standard library:. ..",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:13660,cache,cached,13660,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['cache'],['cached']
Performance,"something incorrectly when they wrote; the annotation. Regardless of why, it is useful to detect these situations so; that the optimizer can make more useful decisions about the code. MisExpect; diagnostics are intended to help developers identify and address these; situations, by comparing the use of the ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic to the ground; truth provided by a profiling input. The MisExpect checks in the LLVM backend follow a simple procedure: if there is; a mismatch between the branch weights collected during profiling and those; supplied by an ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic, then it will emit a diagnostic; message to the user. The most natural place to perform the verification is just prior to when; branch weights are assigned to the target instruction in the form of; branch weight metadata. There are 3 key places in the LLVM backend where branch weights are; created and assigned based on profiling information or the use of the; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic, and our implementation focuses on these; places to perform the verification. We calculate the threshold for emitting MisExpect related diagnostics; based on the values the compiler assigns to ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics,; which can be set through the ``-likely-branch-weight`` and; ``-unlikely-branch-weight`` LLVM options. During verification, if the; profile weights mismatch the calculated threshold, then we will emit a; remark or warning detailing a potential performance regression. The; diagnostic also reports the percentage of the time the annotation was; correct during profiling to help developers reason about how to proceed. The diagnostics are also available in the form of optimization remarks,; which can be serialized and processed through the ``opt-viewer.py``; scripts in LLVM. .. option:: -pass-remarks=misexpect.

Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. For; SequentiallyConsistent loads and stores, the same reorderings are allowed as; for Acquire loads and Release stores, except that SequentiallyConsistent; operations may not be reordered. Notes for code generation; SequentiallyConsistent loads minimally require the same barriers as Acquire; operations and SequentiallyConsistent stores require Release; barriers. Additionally, the code generator must enforce ordering between; SequentiallyConsistent stores followed by SequentiallyConsistent loads. This; is usually done by emitting either a full fence before the loads or a full; fence after the stores; which is preferred varies by architecture. Atomics and IR optimization; ===========================. Predicates for optimizer writers to query:. * ``isSimple()``: A load or store which is not volatile or atomic. This is; what, for example, memcpyopt would check for operations it might transform. * ``isUnordered()``: A load or store which is not volatile and at most; Unordered. This would be checked, for example, by LICM before hoisting an; operation. * ``mayReadFromMemory()``/``mayWriteToMemory()``: Existing predicate, but note; that they return true for any operation which is volatile or at least; Monotonic. * ``isStrongerThan`` / ``isAtLeastOrStrongerThan``: These are predicates on; orderings. They can be useful for passes that are aware of atomics, for; example to do DSE across a single atomic access, but not across a; release-acquire pair (see MemoryDependencyAnalysis for an example of this). * Alias analysis: Note that AA will return ModRef for anything Acquire or; Release, and for the address accessed by any Monotonic operation.

Vector Predication Intrinsics; -----------------------------; VP intrinsics are intended for predicated SIMD/vector code. A typical VP; operation takes a vector mask and an explicit vector length parameter as in:. ::. <W x T> llvm.vp.<opcode>.*(<W x T> %x, <W x T> %y, <W x i1> %mask, i32 %evl). The vector mask parameter (%mask) always has a vector of `i1` type, for example; `<32 x i1>`. The explicit vector length parameter always has the type `i32` and; is an unsigned integer value. The explicit vector length parameter (%evl) is in; the range:. ::. 0 <= %evl <= W, where W is the number of vector elements. Note that for :ref:`scalable vector types <t_vector>` ``W`` is the runtime; length of the vector. The VP intrinsic has undefined behavior if ``%evl > W``. The explicit vector; length (%evl) creates a mask, %EVLmask, with all elements ``0 <= i < %evl`` set; to True, and all other lanes ``%evl <= i < W`` to False. A new mask %M is; calculated with an element-wise AND from %mask and %EVLmask:. ::. M = %mask AND %EVLmask. A vector operation ``<opcode>`` on vectors ``A`` and ``B`` calculates:. ::. A <opcode> B = { A[i] <opcode> B[i] M[i] = True, and; { undef otherwise. Optimization Hint; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some targets, such as AVX512, do not support the %evl parameter in hardware.; The use of an effective %evl is discouraged for those targets. The function; ``TargetTransformInfo::hasActiveVectorLength()`` returns true when the target; has native support for %evl. .. _int_vp_select:.

One of the main features of the LLVM Pass Framework is that it; schedules passes to run in an efficient way based on the constraints that your; pass meets (which are indicated by which class they derive from). We start by showing you how to construct a pass, everything from setting up the; code, to compiling, loading, and executing it. After the basics are down, more; advanced features are discussed. .. warning::; This document deals with the legacy pass manager. LLVM uses the new pass; manager for the optimization pipeline (the codegen pipeline; still uses the legacy pass manager), which has its own way of defining; passes. For more details, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass` and; :doc:`NewPassManager`. Quick Start --- Writing hello world; ===================================. Here we describe how to write the ""hello world"" of passes. The ""Hello"" pass is; designed to simply print out the name of non-external functions that exist in; the program being compiled. It does not modify the program at all, it just; inspects it. The source code and files for this pass are available in the LLVM; source tree in the ``lib/Transforms/Hello`` directory. .. _writing-an-llvm-pass-makefile:. Setting up the build environment; --------------------------------. First, configure and build LLVM. Next, you need to create a new directory; somewhere in the LLVM source base. For this example, we'll assume that you; made ``lib/Transforms/Hello``. Finally, you must set up a build script; that will compile the source code for the new pass.

Indirect calls (and returns in the absence of a red zone ABI) pose the most; significant challenge to propagate. The simplest technique would be to define a; new ABI such that the intended call target is passed into the called function; and checked in the entry. Unfortunately, new ABIs are quite expensive to deploy; in C and C++. While the target function could be passed in TLS, we would still; require complex logic to handle a mixture of functions compiled with and; without this extra logic (essentially, making the ABI backwards compatible).; Currently, we suggest using retpolines here and will continue to investigate; ways of mitigating this. ##### Optimizations, Alternatives, and Tradeoffs. Merely accumulating predicate state involves significant cost. There are; several key optimizations we employ to minimize this and various alternatives; that present different tradeoffs in the generated code. First, we work to reduce the number of instructions used to track the state:; * Rather than inserting a `cmovCC` instruction along every conditional edge in; the original program, we track each set of condition flags we need to capture; prior to entering each basic block and reuse a common `cmovCC` sequence for; those.; * We could further reuse suffixes when there are multiple `cmovCC`; instructions required to capture the set of flags. Currently this is; believed to not be worth the cost as paired flags are relatively rare and; suffixes of them are exceedingly rare.; * A common pattern in x86 is to have multiple conditional jump instructions; that use the same flags but handle different conditions. Naively, we could; consider each fallthrough between them an ""edge"" but this causes a much more; complex control flow graph. Instead, we accumulate the set of conditions; necessary for fallthrough and use a sequence o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:20680,optimiz,optimizations,20680,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support for two fixed; ranges of virtual addresses (the private and local apertures), that are; outside the range of addressable global memory, to map from a flat address to; a private or local address. This uses FLAT instructions that can take a flat; address and access global, private (scratch), and group (LDS) memory depending; on if the address is within one of the aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and setup in the; kernel prologue (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat; access to LDS requires hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register; setup (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`). To convert between a private or group address space address (termed a segment; address) and a flat address the base address of the corresponding aperture; can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with; Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address; so no conversion is needed. **Global and Constant**; The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,; which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU.

However ORC also provides built-in support for lazy; compilation via lazy-reexports (see :ref:`Laziness`). **Support for Custom Compilers and Program Representations**; Clients can supply custom compilers for each symbol that they define in their; JIT session.

Performance,"st reason is that running analyses across outer level IR in inner level; IR passes can result in quadratic compile time behavior. For example, a module; analysis often scans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessary and; there isn't infrastructure for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below). Self-updating analyses that gracefully degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:9871,concurren,concurrency,9871,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['concurren'],['concurrency']

Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 2, i32 1; %tmp3 = load i32, ptr %tmp2; %tmp4 = add i32 %tmp3, %tmp1; %tmp5 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 0, i32 0; store i32 %tmp4, ptr %tmp5; ret void; }. In each case the second operand is the pointer through which the GEP instruction; starts. The same is true whether the second operand is an argument, allocated; memory, or a global variable.

In `RooFit::TestStatistics`, we separated this functionality out into the `ConstantTermsOptimizer` class.; In fact, it is not so much a class, as it is a collection of static functions that can be applied to any combination of pdf and dataset.; This class does essentially the same as `constOptimizeTestStatistic` did on a `RooNLLVar`, except that it has been factored out into a separate class. ### Usage example: apply constant term optimization on pdf and dataset inside a likelihood; Applying the default `ConstantTermsOptimizer` optimization routines on the pdf and dataset inside a `RooAbsL` likelihood is as simple as:. ``` {.cpp}; likelihood.constOptimizeTestStatistic();; ```; This applies constant term optimization to the cloned pdf and dataset inside the likelihood object.; It will not modify anything outside of the likelihood. Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```. For the adventurous user, it is also possible to apply constant term optimization to a pdf and dataset directly without needing a likelihood object, e.g. given some `RooArgSet` set of observables `normSet`:; ``` {.cpp}; bool applyTrackingOpt = true;; ConstantTermsOptimizer::enableConstantTermsOptimization(&pdf, &normSet, dataset, applyTrackingOpt);; ```; We refer to RooFit documentation for more about ""tracking optimization"" which can be enabled",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:10320,optimiz,optimization,10320,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,2,['optimiz'],['optimization']

In this example, the definition of the template function ``twice`` is outside; the pragma region, whereas the definition of ``thrice`` is inside the region.; The ``container`` function is also in the region and will not be optimized, but; it causes the instantiation of ``twice`` and ``thrice`` with an ``int`` type; of; these two instantiations, ``twice`` will be optimized (because its definition; was outside the region) and ``thrice`` will not be optimized. Clang also implements MSVC's range-based pragma,; ``#pragma optimize(""[optimization-list]"", on | off)``. At the moment, Clang only; supports an empty optimization list, whereas MSVC supports the arguments, ``s``,; ``g``, ``t``, and ``y``.

Since we already know what buffers are going to be read, we can decompress a few of them in advance in an additional thread and give the impression that the data decompression comes for free (we gain up to 30% in reading intensive jobs). The size of this unzipping cache is 20% the size of the TTreeCache and can be modified with TTreeCache::SetUnzipBufferSize(Long64_t bufferSize). Theoretically, we only need one buffer in advance but in practice we might fall short if the unzipping cache is too small (synchronization costs).

Be aware that these extensions do not work when a compiler replaces; the interpreter. Your code will not compile, hence when writing large; scripts, it is best to stay away from these shortcuts. It will save; you from having problems compiling your scripts using a real C++; compiler. ## ACLiC: Compiling Scripts Into Libraries. Instead of having Cling interpret your script there is a way to have your; scripts compiled, linked and dynamically loaded using the C++ compiler; and linker. The advantage of this is that your scripts will run with the; speed of compiled C++ and that you can use language constructs that are; not fully supported by Cling. On the other hand, you cannot use any Cling; shortcuts (see ""C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting"" above) and for small scripts, the; overhead of the compile/link cycle might be larger than just executing; the script in the interpreter. ACLiC will build a dictionary and a shared library from your C++; script, using the compiler and the compiler options that were used to; compile the ROOT executable. You do not have to write a Makefile; remembering the correct compiler options, and you do not have to exit; ROOT. ### Usage.

On the other hand, a non-volatile non-atomic load can; be moved across a volatile load freely, but not an Acquire load. This document is intended to provide a guide to anyone either writing a frontend; for LLVM or working on optimization passes for LLVM with a guide for how to deal; with instructions with special semantics in the presence of concurrency. This; is not intended to be a precise guide to the semantics; the details can get; extremely complicated and unreadable, and are not usually necessary. .. _Optimization outside atomic:. Optimization outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }.

Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely. The :doc:`LLVM test-suite <TestSuiteMakefileGuide>` provides a framework to; test the optimizer's handling of debugging information. It can be run like; this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=dbgopt. This will test impact of debugging information on optimization passes. If; debugging information influences optimization passes then it will be reported; as a failure.

LLVM debugging information has been carefully designed to make it possible for; the optimizer to optimize the program and debugging information without; necessarily having to know anything about debugging information. In; particular, the use of metadata avoids duplicated debugging information from; the beginning, and the global dead code elimination pass automatically deletes; debugging information for a function if it decides to delete the function. To do this, most of the debugging information (descriptors for types,; variables, functions, source files, etc) is inserted by the language front-end; in the form of LLVM metadata.

The number of elements is a constant integer value larger than 0;; elementtype may be any integer, floating-point or pointer type. Vectors; of size zero are not allowed. For scalable vectors, the total number of; elements is a constant multiple (called vscale) of the specified number; of elements; vscale is a positive integer that is unknown at compile time; and the same hardware-dependent constant for all scalable vectors at run; time.

When the call site is reached, the argument allocation must have; been the most recent stack allocation that is still live, or the; behavior is undefined. It is possible to allocate additional stack; space after an argument allocation and before its call site, but it; must be cleared off with :ref:`llvm.stackrestore; <int_stackrestore>`. The inalloca attribute requires a type argument, which must be the; same as the pointee type of the argument.

Performance,"stores, etc). Experience with SSA forms for memory in other compilers has shown that; it is simply not possible to do this precisely, and in fact, doing it; precisely is not worth it, because now all the optimizations have to; walk tons and tons of virtual variables and phi nodes. So we partition. At the point at which you partition, again,; experience has shown us there is no point in partitioning to more than; one variable. It simply generates more IR, and optimizations still; have to query something to disambiguate further anyway. As a result, LLVM partitions to one variable. Precision in practice; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In practice, there are implementation details in LLVM that also affect the; results' precision provided by ``MemorySSA``. For example, AliasAnalysis has various; caps, or restrictions on looking through phis which can affect what ``MemorySSA``; can infer. Changes made by different passes may make MemorySSA either ""overly; optimized"" (it can provide a more accurate result than if it were recomputed; from scratch), or ""under optimized"" (it could infer more if it were recomputed).; This can lead to challenges to reproduced results in isolation with a single pass; when the result relies on the state acquired by ``MemorySSA`` due to being updated by; multiple subsequent passes.; Passes that use and update ``MemorySSA`` should do so through the APIs provided by the; ``MemorySSAUpdater``, or through calls on the Walker.; Direct optimizations to ``MemorySSA`` are not permitted.; There is currently a single, narrowly scoped exception where DSE (DeadStoreElimination); updates an optimized access of a store, after a traversal that guarantees the; optimization is correct. This is solely allowed due to the traversals and inferences; being beyond what ``MemorySSA`` does and them being ""free"" (i.e. DSE does them anyway).; This exception is set under a flag (""-dse-optimize-memoryssa"") and can be disabled to; help reproduce optimizations in isolation.

Performance,"strained. This is required for correct LLVM IR. Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"". If this argument is ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes must assume that the; rounding mode is unknown and may change at runtime. No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed.

A ""long"" or ""unsigned long"" member is always written; as an 8 byte quantity, even if it occupies only 4 bytes in memory. A data member of a class is marked transient on the line of its declaration by a; comment beginning with ""//!"". Such members are not written to disk, nor is there; any streamerinfo for such a member. A data member that is a C++ pointer (not to be confused with ""pointers to persistent; objects"" described below) is never written to disk as a pointer value. If it is a; pointer to an object, the object itself (or 0 (4 bytes) if the pointer value is NULL); is written. If the declaration line has a comment beginning with ""//->"", this indicates; that the pointer value will never be null, which allows a performance optimization.; Another optimization is that if two or more pointers pointing to the same object are; streamed in the same I/O operation, the object is written only once. The remaining; pointers reference the object through a unique object identifier. This saves space; and avoids the infinite loop that might otherwise arise if the directed graph of object; instance pointer references contains a cycle. If a data member is a pointer to a simple type, the Streamer presumes it is an array,; with the dimension defined in a comment of the form ""//[<length>]"", where length is; either an integer constant or a variable that is an integer data member of the class.; If a variable is used, it must be defined ahead of its use or in a base class. The above describes the function of the StreamerInfo record in decomposing a; self-identifying object if the user uses the streamer generated by ""rootcint"".; There are two reasons why a user may need to write a specialized streamer for a class.; One reason is that it may be necessary to execute some code before or after data is read; or written, f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/TFile/README.md:8095,optimiz,optimization,8095,io/doc/TFile/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/TFile/README.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"struction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instruction should be the same; as the location of the ``add`` instruction. * Tail duplication. For example, if blocks ``B1`` and ``B2`` both; unconditionally branch to ``B3`` and ``B3`` can be folded into its; predecessors, source locations from ``B3`` should be preserved. Examples of transformations for which this rule *does not* apply include:. * LICM. E.g., if an instruction is moved from the loop body to the preheader,; the rule for :ref:`dropping locations<WhenToDropLocation>` applies. In addition to the rule above, a transformation should also preserve the debug; location of an instruction that is moved between basic blocks, if the; destination block already contains an instruction with an identical debug; location.
