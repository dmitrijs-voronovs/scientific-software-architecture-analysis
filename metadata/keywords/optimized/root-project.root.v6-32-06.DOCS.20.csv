Performance,"haracterization of the performance, and specific benchmarks are unlikely to; reveal especially interesting properties. ### Future Work: Fine Grained Control and API-Integration. The performance overhead of this technique is likely to be very significant and; something users wish to control or reduce. There are interesting options here; that impact the implementation strategy used. One particularly appealing option is to allow both opt-in and opt-out of this; mitigation at reasonably fine granularity such as on a per-function basis,; including intelligent handling of inlining decisions -- protected code can be; prevented from inlining into unprotected code, and unprotected code will become; protected when inlined into protected code. For systems where only a limited; set of code is reachable by externally controlled inputs, it may be possible to; limit the scope of mitigation through such mechanisms without compromising the; application's overall security. The performance impact may also be focused in a; few key functions that can be hand-mitigated in ways that have lower; performance overhead while the remainder of the application receives automatic; protection. For both limiting the scope of mitigation or manually mitigating hot functions,; there needs to be some support for mixing mitigated and unmitigated code; without completely defeating the mitigation. For the first use case, it would; be particularly desirable that mitigated code remains safe when being called; during misspeculation from unmitigated code. For the second use case, it may be important to connect the automatic; mitigation technique to explicit mitigation APIs such as what is described in; http://wg21.link/p0928 (or any other eventual API) so that there is a clean way; to switch from automatic to manual mitigation without immediately exposing a; hole. However, the design for how to do this is hard to come up with until the; APIs are better established. We will revisit this as those APIs mature.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:49671,perform,performance,49671,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,['perform'],['performance']

The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }.

Performance,"hat in safe floating-point; modes, such as `-ffp-model=precise` or `-ffp-model=strict`, this option; has no effect because the optimizer is prohibited from making unsafe; transformations. .. option:: -fexcess-precision:. The C and C++ standards allow floating-point expressions to be computed as if; intermediate results had more precision (and/or a wider range) than the type; of the expression strictly allows. This is called excess precision; arithmetic.; Excess precision arithmetic can improve the accuracy of results (although not; always), and it can make computation significantly faster if the target lacks; direct hardware support for arithmetic in a particular type. However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization. However, when; excess precision arithmetic is in use, Clang does not guarantee strict; reproducibility, and future compiler releases may recognize more; opportunities to use excess precision arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point; builtins. Clang does not use excess precision arithmetic for most types or on most; targets. For example, even on pre-SSE X86 targets where ``float`` and; ``double`` computations must be performed in the 80-bit X87 format, Clang; rounds all intermediate results correctly for their type. Clang currently; uses excess precision arithmetic by default only for the following types and; targets:. * ``_Float16`` on X86 targets without ``AVX512-FP16``.

A :arc-term:`bridged cast` is a C-style cast annotated with one of three; keywords:. * ``(__bridge T) op`` casts the operand to the destination type ``T``. If; ``T`` is a retainable object pointer type, then ``op`` must have a; non-retainable pointer type. If ``T`` is a non-retainable pointer type,; then ``op`` must have a retainable object pointer type. Otherwise the cast; is ill-formed. There is no transfer of ownership, and ARC inserts no retain; operations.; * ``(__bridge_retained T) op`` casts the operand, which must have retainable; object pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a non-retainable; pointer type. ARC retains the value, subject to the usual optimizations on; local values, and the recipient is responsible for balancing that +1.; * ``(__bridge_transfer T) op`` casts the operand, which must have; non-retainable pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a; retainable object pointer type. ARC will release the value at the end of; the enclosing full-expression, subject to the usual optimizations on local; values. These casts are required in order to transfer objects in and out of ARC; control; see the rationale in the section on :ref:`conversion of retainable; object pointers <arc.objects.restrictions.conversion>`.

The rules in a ruleset are executed; from top to bottom and will start again from the top if an instruction is; legalized as a result of the rules. If the ruleset is exhausted without; satisfying any rule, then it is considered unsupported. When it doesn't declare the instruction legal, each pass over the rules may; request that one type changes to another type. Sometimes this can cause multiple; types to change but we avoid this as much as possible as making multiple changes; can make it difficult to avoid infinite loops where, for example, narrowing one; type causes another to be too small and widening that type causes the first one; to be too big. In general, it's advisable to declare instructions legal as close to the top of; the rule as possible and to place any expensive rules as low as possible. This; helps with performance as testing for legality happens more often than; legalization and legalization can require multiple passes over the rules. As a concrete example, consider the rule::. getActionDefinitionsBuilder({G_ADD, G_SUB, G_MUL, G_AND, G_OR, G_XOR, G_SHL}); .legalFor({s32, s64, v2s32, v4s32, v2s64}); .clampScalar(0, s32, s64); .widenScalarToNextPow2(0);. and the instruction::. %2:_(s7) = G_ADD %0:_(s7), %1:_(s7). this doesn't meet the predicate for the :ref:`.legalFor() <legalfor>` as ``s7``; is not one of the listed types so it falls through to the; :ref:`.clampScalar() <clampscalar>`. It does meet the predicate for this rule; as the type is smaller than the ``s32`` and this rule instructs the legalizer; to change type 0 to ``s32``. It then restarts from the top. This time it does; satisfy ``.legalFor()`` and the resulting output is::. %3:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %0:_(s7); %4:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %1:_(s7); %5:_(s32) = G_ADD %3:_(s32), %4:_(s32); %2:_(s7) = G_TRUNC %5:_(s32). where the ``G_ADD`` is legal and the other instructions are scheduled for; pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst:4864,perform,performance,4864,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

It's not possible to write a checker which could find all rule violations; statically. It would be possible to write a checker which works by instrumenting; the code with dynamic checks though. Alternatively, it would be possible to; write a static checker which catches a subset of possible problems. However, no; such checker exists today. Rationale; =========. Why is GEP designed this way?; -----------------------------. The design of GEP has the following goals, in rough unofficial order of; priority:. * Support C, C-like languages, and languages which can be conceptually lowered; into C (this covers a lot). * Support optimizations such as those that are common in C compilers. In; particular, GEP is a cornerstone of LLVM's `pointer aliasing; model <LangRef.html#pointeraliasing>`_. * Provide a consistent method for computing addresses so that address; computations don't need to be a part of load and store instructions in the IR. * Support non-C-like languages, to the extent that it doesn't interfere with; other goals. * Minimize target-specific information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct.

Performance,"he basic block B is an exiting block; ending in a divergent branch, and the basic block C is an exit of the loop.; Thus, the call to convergent_op() is outside the loop. This causes a mismatch; between the programmer's expectation and the compiled program.

But when compiled, all threads that; take the divergent exit on different iterations first converge at the beginning; of basic block C and then together execute the call to convergent_op(). In this case, :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop; <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>` can be used to express the desired; semantics. A call to this intrinsic is placed in the loop header, which tracks; each iteration of the loop. The token produced by this is used as a; ``convergencectrl`` operand to the convergent call.

Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions.

Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution.

In order to obtain the correct ExplodedNode, a decision must be made; as to whether or not analysis can continue along the current path. This decision; is based on whether the detected bug is one that would prevent the program under; analysis from continuing. For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification. This ExplodedNode will be the one; returned by the most recent call to CheckerContext::addTransition.; If no transition has been performed during the current callback, the checker should call CheckerContext::addTransition(); and use the returned node for bug reporting. If analysis can not continue, then the current state should be transitioned; into a so-called sink node, a node from which no further analysis will be; performed. This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node.

At a high level, LLVM has been extended to support compiling to an abstract; machine which extends the actual target with a non-integral pointer type; suitable for representing a garbage collected reference to an object. In; particular, such non-integral pointer type have no defined mapping to an; integer representation. This semantic quirk allows the runtime to pick a; integer mapping for each point in the program allowing relocations of objects; without visible effects. This high level abstract machine model is used for most of the optimizer. As; a result, transform passes do not need to be extended to look through explicit; relocation sequence. Before starting code generation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream.

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane. For efficiency, the expression calculates the source location the wavefront as a; whole. This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix.

Performance,"he following trivial assembly::. f: // @f; movz	w8, #0x2a; ins 	v0.s[0], w8; ret. Problem; =======. The main problem is how vectors are represented in memory and in registers. First, a recap. The ""endianness"" of an item affects its representation in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:2683,load,load,2683,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"he ordering and the adjacency between the two or more; assignments. The Clang CFG is used to implement this analysis as Clang CFG; provides a linear view of statements within each ``CFGBlock`` (Clang; ``CFGBlock`` represents a single basic block in a source-level CFG). Bounds check optimizations; ==========================. In ``-fbounds-safety``, the Clang frontend emits run-time checks for every; memory dereference if the type system or analyses in the frontend couldn’t; verify its bounds safety. The implementation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count.

Performance,"he section on; :ref:`modules <pchinternals-modules>`. Clang's AST files are designed with a compact on-disk representation, which; minimizes both creation time and the time required to initially load the AST; file. The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk.

It is possible to put; ORC components together to make a non-lazy, in-process, single threaded JIT; or a lazy, out-of-process, concurrent JIT, or anything in between. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT; ===================. ORC provides two basic JIT classes off-the-shelf. These are useful both as; examples of how to assemble ORC components to make a JIT, and as replacements; for earlier LLVM JIT APIs (e.g. MCJIT). The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.take",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:3957,perform,performed,3957,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['perform'],['performed']

When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not mean A noalias C), so it is not possible to; come up with a precise partitioning in all cases without variables to; represent every pair of possible aliases. Thus, partitioning; precisely may require introducing at least N^2 new virtual variables,; phi nodes, etc. Each of these variables may be clobbered at multiple def sites.

It is also possible to create globals interactively, either by executing; a Cling macro, or by a call to `gROOT.ProcessLine()`. These globals are; made available in the same way: either use them directly after creation; in 'from ROOT import \*' more, or get them from the ROOT namespace after; an 'import ROOT'.

To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that representation directly. Thus, a module's headers will only be parsed once per language configuration, rather than once per translation unit that uses the module. Modules maintain references to each of the headers that were part of the module build. If any of those headers changes, or if any of the modules on which a module depends change, then the module will be (automatically) recompiled. The process should never require any user intervention.

It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an; arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the; buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff).; The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable; length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the; same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object.; This container guarantees the ""``(char*)(&Value+1)``"" points to the key string; for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache; efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed; when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for; unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),; hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the; table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data; is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair). StringMap also provides query methods that take byte ranges, so it only ever; copies a string if a value is inserted into the table.

Going; on and opening our packs, we will obviously find out some empty ones,; otherwise, something is very wrong... We will call these leaves (by; analogy with a tree structure).

If the class is instantiated with a tree as a; parameter to the constructor, `fChain` will point to the tree named in; the parameter. Next is `fCurrent`, which is also a pointer to the; current tree/chain. Its role is only relevant when we have multiple; trees chained together in a **`TChain`**. The class definition shows us; that this tree has one branch and one leaf per data member. The methods; of `MyClass` are:. - `MyClass(TTree *tree=0) -` this constructor has an optional tree; for a parameter. If you pass a tree, `MyClass` will use it rather; than the tree from which it was created. - `void Init(TTree *tree) -` it is called by the constructor to; initialize the tree for reading. It associates each branch with the; corresponding leaf data member. - `~MyClass() - `the destructor, nothing special. - `Int_t GetEntry(Int_t entry) -` it loads the class with the entry; specified. Once you have executed `GetEntry`, the leaf data members; in `MyClass` are set to the values of the entry. For example,; `GetEntry(12)` loads the 13th event into the event data member of; `MyClass` (note that the first entry is 0). `GetEntry` returns the; number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read; twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case `GetEntry`; returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return; of 0 means an error has occurred while reading. - `Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry)` and `void Notify()` - these two; methods are related to chains. `LoadTree` will load the tree; containing the specified entry from a chain of trees. Notify is; called by `LoadTree` to adjust the branch addresses. - `void Loop()` - it is the skeleton method that loops through each; entry of the tree.

Performance,"his guidance is that a unified return block with high in-degree is fine. Use of allocas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An alloca instruction can be used to represent a function scoped stack slot,; but can also represent dynamic frame expansion. When representing function; scoped variables or locations, placing alloca instructions at the beginning of; the entry block should be preferred. In particular, place them before any; call instructions. Call instructions might get inlined and replaced with; multiple basic blocks. The end result is that a following alloca instruction; would no longer be in the entry basic block afterward.

It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

Performance,"hose cases, the filter is not expected to handle line; breaks in arbitrary places inside a markup element, but only inside certain; fields. This format assumes that the symbolizing filter processes a coherent stream of; log lines from a single process address space context. If a logging stream; interleaves log lines from more than one process, these must be collated into; separate per-process log streams and each stream processed by a separate; instance of the symbolizing filter. Because the kernel and user processes use; disjoint address regions in most operating systems, a single user process; address space plus the kernel address space can be treated as a single address; space for symbolization purposes if desired. Dependence on Build IDs; =======================. The symbolizer markup scheme relies on contextual information about runtime; memory address layout to make it possible to convert markup elements into useful; symbolic form. This relies on having an unmistakable identification of which; binary was loaded at each address. An ELF Build ID is the payload of an ELF note with name ``""GNU""`` and type; ``NT_GNU_BUILD_ID``, a unique byte sequence that identifies a particular binary; (executable, shared library, loadable module, or driver module). The linker; generates this automatically based on a hash that includes the complete symbol; table and debugging information, even if this is later stripped from the binary. This specification uses the ELF Build ID as the sole means of identifying; binaries. Each binary relevant to the log must have been linked with a unique; Build ID. The symbolizing filter must have some means of mapping a Build ID back; to the original ELF binary (either the whole unstripped binary, or a stripped; binary paired with a separate debug file).

The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method.

You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option.

If it turns out that this is a large burden, we can just place ``MemoryPhi``\ s; everywhere. Because we have Walkers that are capable of optimizing above said; phis, doing so shouldn't prohibit optimizations. Non-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations. Specifically, care must be taken when trying to use ``MemorySSA``; to reason about atomic or volatile operations, as in:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @foo(ptr %a) {; entry:; br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.end. if.then:; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); %0 = load volatile i8, ptr %a; br label %if.end. if.end:; %av = phi i8 [0, %entry], [%0, %if.then]; ret i8 %av; }. Going solely by ``MemorySSA``'s analysis, hoisting the ``load`` to ``entry`` may; seem legal. Because it's a volatile load, though, it's not. Design tradeoffs; ----------------. Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory).

Performance,"i8*`` style typed pointers. In opaque pointer mode, all typed pointers used in IR, bitcode, or created; using ``PointerType::get()`` and similar APIs are automatically converted into; opaque pointers. This simplifies migration and allows testing existing IR with; opaque pointers. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8* @test(i8* %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, i8* %p, i64 1; ret i8* %p2; }. ; Is automatically converted into the following if -opaque-pointers; ; is enabled:. define ptr @test(ptr %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, ptr %p, i64 1; ret ptr %p2; }. Migration Instructions; ======================. In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type. Here are some common ways to avoid pointer element type accesses:. * For loads, use ``getType()``.; * For stores, use ``getValueOperand()->getType()``.; * Use ``getLoadStoreType()`` to handle both of the above in one call.; * For getelementptr instructions, use ``getSourceElementType()``.; * For calls, use ``getFunctionType()``.; * For allocas, use ``getAllocatedType()``.; * For globals, use ``getValueType()``.; * For consistency assertions, use; ``PointerType::isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()``.; * To create a pointer type in a different address space, use; ``PointerType::getWithSamePointeeType()``.; * To check that two pointers have the same element type, use; ``PointerType::hasSameElementTypeAs()``.; * While it is preferred to write code in a way that accepts both typed and; opaque pointers, ``Type::isOpaquePointerTy()`` and; ``PointerType::isOpaque()`` can be used to handle opaque pointers specially.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:6636,optimiz,optimizations,6636,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,2,"['load', 'optimiz']","['load', 'optimizations']"

CMake Caches; ============. Recently LLVM and Clang have been adding some more complicated build system; features. Utilizing these new features often involves a complicated chain of; CMake variables passed on the command line. Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs.

For GCs which use barriers or unusual treatment of stack roots, the; implementor is responsibly for providing a custom pass to lower the; intrinsics with the desired semantics. If you have opted in to custom; lowering of a particular intrinsic your pass **must** eliminate all; instances of the corresponding intrinsic in functions which opt in to; your GC.

Performance,"ialize. Types that don't express ownership may still; be non-trivial to copy because of some sort of address sensitivity;; for example, a relative reference. Distinguishing default; initialization allows types to impose policies about how they are; created. These rules assume that assignment into an l-value is always a; modification of an existing object rather than an initialization.; Assignment is then a compound operation where the old value is; read and destroyed, if necessary, and the new value is put into; place. These are the natural semantics of value propagation, where; all basic operations on the type come down to copies and destroys,; and everything else is just an optimization on top of those. The most glaring weakness of programming with non-trivial types in C; is that there are no language mechanisms (akin to C++'s placement; ``new`` and explicit destructor calls) for explicitly creating and; destroying objects. Clang should consider adding builtins for this; purpose, as well as for common optimizations like destructive; relocation. Application of the formal C rules to nontrivial ownership qualifiers; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Nontrivially ownership-qualified types are considered non-trivial; to copy, destroy, and default-initialize.

Such an object can be safely accessed in; all of the cases above, but its memory can also be safely repurposed.; Assigning a null pointer into an l-value of ``__weak`` or; ``__strong``-qualified type accesses the dynamic object there (and thus; may have undefined behavior if no such object exists), but afterwards; the object's memory is guaranteed to be filled with a zero pattern; and thus may be either further accessed or repurposed as needed.; The upshot is that programs may safely initialize dynamically-alloc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:59624,optimiz,optimizations,59624,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Performance,"iant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order. I Still Can't Find What I'm Looking For; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you didn't find what you were looking for above, consider proposing a piece; of metadata which provides the optimization hint you need. Such extensions are; relatively common and are generally well received by the community. You will; need to ensure that your proposal is sufficiently general so that it benefits; others if you wish to contribute it upstream. You should also consider describing the problem you're facing on `Discourse; <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_ and asking for advice.; It's entirely possible someone has encountered your problem before and can; give good advice.

CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic; operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those; optimizations useful. Notes for code generation; Code generation is essentially the same as that for unordered for loads and; stores. No fences are required. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are required; to appear as a single operation. Acquire; -------. Acquire provides a barrier of the sort necessary to acquire a lock to access; other memory with normal loads and stores. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_acquire``. It should also be; used for C++/C ``memory_order_consume``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Acquire only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with a Release; operation. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move stores from before an Acquire load or read-modify-write; operation to after it, and move non-Acquire loads from before an Acquire; operation to after it. Notes for code generation; Architectures with weak memory ordering (essentially everything relevant today; except x86 and SPARC) require some sort of fence to maintain the Acquire; semantics. The precise fences required varies widely by architecture, but for; a simple implementation, most architectures provide a barrier which is strong; enough for everything (``dmb`` on ARM, ``sync`` on PowerPC, etc.). Putting; such a fence after the equivalent Monotonic operation is sufficient to; maintain Acquire semantics for a memory operation. Release; -------.

The code sequences used to implement the memory model specify the order of; instructions that a single thread must execute.

Which then becomes the following trivial assembly::. f: // @f; movz	w8, #0x2a; ins 	v0.s[0], w8; ret. Problem; =======. The main problem is how vectors are represented in memory and in registers. First, a recap. The ""endianness"" of an item affects its representation in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endia",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:2458,load,loading,2458,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['loading']
Performance,"ic information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #. The second operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and it must be; indexed. #. There are no superfluous indices for the GEP instruction. #. Trailing zero indices are superfluous for pointer aliasing, but not for the; types of the pointers. #. Leading zero indices are not superfluous for pointer aliasing nor the types; of the pointers.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:21067,optimiz,optimizer,21067,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizer']

This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking.

Monotonic is the weakest level of atomicity that can be used in synchronization; primitives, although it does not provide any general synchronization. It; essentially guarantees that if you take all the operations affecting a specific; address, a consistent ordering exists. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution. The; guarantees in terms of synchronization are very weak, so make sure these are; only used in a pattern which you know is correct. Generally, these would; either be used for atomic operations which do not protect other memory (like; an atomic counter), or along with a ``fence``. Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this can be treated as a read+write on the relevant; memory location (and alias analysis will take advantage of that). In addition,; it is legal to reorder non-atomic and Unordered loads around Monotonic; loads. CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic; operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those; optimizations useful. Notes for code generation; Code generation is essentially the same as that for unordered for loads and; stores. No fences are required. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are required; to appear as a single operation. Acquire; -------. Acquire provides a barrier of the sort necessary to acquire a lock to access; other memory with normal loads and stores. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_acquire``.

""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"". If this argument is ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes must assume that the; rounding mode is unknown and may change at runtime. No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior. The exception behavior argument is a metadata string describing the floating; point exception semantics that required for the intrinsic. This argument; must be one of the following strings:. ::.

Performance,"identify all pointers in the; program at run-time (which requires that the source-language be type-safe in; most cases). Identifying pointers at run-time requires compiler support to; locate all places that hold live pointer variables at run-time, including the; :ref:`processor stack and registers <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------.

By promoting array references to ``__bidi_indexable``, all array accesses are; bounds checked in ``-fbounds-safety``, just as ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers; are. Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations; ---------------------------------------------. ``-fbounds-safety`` maintains correctness of bounds annotations by performing; additional checks when a pointer object and/or its related value containing the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them.

Performance,"ies does NOT imply; penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape. Choosing a normal container is therefore; recommended whenever possible. ![Assemblies of volumes](pictures/080001CF.png). ### Geometrical Transformations. All geometrical transformations handled by the modeller are provided as; a built-in package. This was designed to minimize memory requirements; and optimize performance of point/vector master-to-local and; local-to-master computation. We need to have in mind that a; transformation in **`TGeo`** has two major use-cases. The first one is; for defining the placement of a volume with respect to its container; reference frame. This frame will be called 'master' and the frame of the; positioned volume - 'local'. If `T` is a transformation used for; positioning volume daughters, then: `MASTER = T * LOCAL`. Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class. A general homogenous transformation is defined as a 4x4 matrix embedding; a rotation, a translation and a scale. The advantage of this description; is that each basic transformation can be represented as a homogenous; matrix, composition being performed as simple matrix multiplication.

In the; following, we have some parameters, like tick marks length and; characters height (in percentage of the length of the axis, in user; coordinates). The default values are as follows:. - Primary tick marks: 3.0 %. - Secondary tick marks: 1.5 %. - Third order tick marks: .75 %. - Characters height for labels: 4%. - Labels offset: 1.0 %. #### Stripping Decimals. Use the `TStyle::SetStripDecimals` to strip decimals when drawing axis; labels. By default, the option is set to true, and `TGaxis::PaintAxis`; removes trailing zeros after the dot in the axis labels, e.g. {0, 0.5,; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc.}. ``` {.cpp}; TStyle::SetStripDecimals (Bool_t strip=kTRUE); ```. If this function is called with `strip=kFALSE`, `TGaxis::PaintAxis()`; will draw labels with the same number of digits after the dot, e.g.; {0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc.}. #### Optional Grid. `chopt = 'W'`: cross-Wire. #### Axis Binning Optimization. By default, the axis binning is optimized. - `chopt = 'N'`: No binning optimization. - `chopt = 'I'`: Integer labeling. ### Axis with Time Units. Histograms' axis can be defined as ""time axis"". To do that it is enough; to activate the `SetTimeDisplay` attribute on a given axis. If `h` is a; histogram, it is done the following way:. ``` {.cpp}; h->GetXaxis()->SetTimeDisplay(1); // X axis is a time axis; ```. Two parameters can be adjusted in order to define time axis: the time; format and the time offset. #### Time Format. It defines the format of the labels along the time axis. It can be; changed using the **`TAxis`** method `SetTimeFormat`. The time format is; the one used by the C function `strftime()`. It is a string containing; the following formatting characters:. +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+; | For the date: | %a abbreviated weekday name |; | | |; | | %b abbreviated month name |; | | |; | | %d day of the month (01-31) |; | | |; | | %m month (01-12) |;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:58176,optimiz,optimized,58176,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time.

When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`.

In addition, some IR; locations become unavailable, for example if the operation of multiple IR; instructions are combined into one machine instruction (such as; multiply-and-accumulate) then intermediate Values are lost. To track variable; locations through instruction selection, they are first separated into; locations that do not depend on code generation (constants, stack locations,; allocated virtual registers) and those that do. For those that do, debug; metadata is attached to SDNodes in SelectionDAGs. After instruction selection; has occurred and a MIR function is created, if the SDNode associated with debug; metadata is allocated a virtual register, that virtual register is used as the; variable location.

What's New in Clang |release|?; ==============================; Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed; here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying; infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific; sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages. C++ Language Changes; --------------------. C++20 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P1907R1 <https://wg21.link/P1907R1>`_ which extends allowed non-type template argument; kinds with e.g. floating point values and pointers and references to subobjects.; This feature is still experimental. Accordingly, ``__cpp_nontype_template_args`` was not updated.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_generalized_nttp)``. - Clang won't perform ODR checks for decls in the global module fragment any; more to ease the implementation and improve the user's using experience.; This follows the MSVC's behavior. Users interested in testing the more strict; behavior can use the flag '-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf'.; (`#79240 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79240>`_). C++23 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P0847R7: Deducing this <https://wg21.link/P0847R7>`_. Some related core issues were also; implemented (`CWG2553 <https://wg21.link/CWG2553>`_, `CWG2554 <https://wg21.link/CWG2554>`_,; `CWG2653 <https://wg21.link/CWG2653>`_, `CWG2687 <https://wg21.link/CWG2687>`_). Because the; support for this feature is still experimental, the feature test macro ``__cpp_explicit_this_parameter``; was not set in this version.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_explicit_this_parameter)``. - Added a separate warning to warn the use of attributes on lambdas as a C++23 extension; in previous language versions: ``-Wc++23-lambda-attributes`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:9175,perform,perform,9175,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"ified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior. The exception behavior argument is a metadata string describing the floating; point exception semantics that required for the intrinsic. This argument; must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""fpexcept.ignore""; ""fpexcept.maytrap""; ""fpexcept.strict"". If this argument is ""fpexcept.ignore"" optimization passes may assume that the; exception status flags will not be read and that floating-point exceptions will; be masked. This allows transformations to be performed that may change the; exception semantics of the original code. For example, FP operations may be; speculatively executed in this case whereas they must not be for either of the; other possible values of this argument. If the exception behavior argument is ""fpexcept.maytrap"" optimization passes; must avoid transformations that may raise exceptions that would not have been; raised by the original code (such as speculatively executing FP operations), but; passes are not required to preserve all exceptions that are implied by the; original code. For example, exceptions may be potentially hidden by constant; folding.

If the cmpxchg operation is marked as ``weak`` then a spurious failure is; permitted: the operation may not write ``<new>`` even if the comparison; matched. If the cmpxchg operation is strong (the default), the i1 value is 1 if and only; if the value loaded equals ``cmp``.

Performance,"ignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #. Prefer globals over inttoptr of a constant address - this gives you; dereferencability information. In MCJIT, use getSymbolAddress to provide; actual address. #.

Performance,"il/llvm-dev/2015-February/081822.html>`_. Issues with explicit pointee types; ==================================. LLVM IR pointers can be cast back and forth between pointers with different; pointee types. The pointee type does not necessarily represent the actual; underlying type in memory. In other words, the pointee type carries no real; semantics. Historically LLVM was some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type.

This is because; having any plugins that run after the codegen action automatically turns off; ``-clear-ast-before-backend``. ``-clear-ast-before-backend`` reduces peak; memory by clearing the Clang AST after generating IR and before running IR; optimizations.

Possible Questions; ==================. How modules speed up compilation; --------------------------------. A classic theory for the reason why modules speed up the compilation is:; if there are ``n`` headers and ``m`` source files and each header is included by each source file,; then the complexity of the compilation is ``O(n*m)``;; But if there are ``n`` module interfaces and ``m`` source files, the complexity of the compilation is; ``O(n+m)``. So, using modules would be a big win when scaling.; In a simpler word, we could get rid of many redundant compilations by using modules. Roughly, this theory is correct. But the problem is that it is too rough.; The behavior depends on the optimization level, as we will illustrate below. First is ``O0``. The compilation process is described in the following graph. .. code-block:: none. ├-------------frontend----------┼-------------middle end----------------┼----backend----┤; │ │ │ │; └---parsing----sema----codegen--┴----- transformations ---- codegen ----┴---- codegen --┘. ┌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; | │; | source file │; | │; └---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┘. ┌--------┐; │ │; │imported│; │ │; │ code │; │ │; └--------┘. Here we can see that the source file (could be a non-module unit or a module unit) would get processed by the; whole pipeline.; But the imported code would only get involved in semantic analysis, which is mainly about name lookup,; overload resolution and template instantiation.; All of these processes are fast relative to the whole compilation process.; More importantly, the imported code only n",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:40218,optimiz,optimization,40218,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

When the `kBypassStreamer` bit is set, the automatically generated; `Streamer `can call directly the method **`TClass::WriteBuffer`**.; Bypassing the `Streamer` improves the performance when writing/reading; the objects in the **`TClonesArray`**. However, the drawback is when a; **`TClonesArray`** is written with `split=0` bypassing the `Streamer`,; the `StreamerInfo `of the class in the array being optimized, one cannot; later use the **`TClonesArray`** with `split > 0`. For example, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`. The result will be `Bar` objects with data; member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is; to call `BypassStreamer(kFALSE)` for the **`TClonesArray`**. In this; case, the normal `Bar::Streamer` function will be called.

In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation.

We would like; to ask reader to keep this file open, so we could use it as a reference; for further explanations. Now, we're ready to proceed to the next chapter and see how it works. Functions comparison; ====================; At first, let's define how exactly we compare complex objects. Complex object comparison (function, basic-block, etc) is mostly based on its; sub-object comparison results. It is similar to the next ""tree"" objects; comparison:. #. For two trees *T1* and *T2* we perform *depth-first-traversal* and have; two sequences as a product: ""*T1Items*"" and ""*T2Items*"". #. We then compare chains ""*T1Items*"" and ""*T2Items*"" in; the most-significant-item-first order. The result of items comparison; would be the result of *T1* and *T2* comparison itself. FunctionComparator::compare(void); ---------------------------------; A brief look at the source code tells us that the comparison starts in the; “``int FunctionComparator::compare(void)``” method. 1. The first parts to be compared are the function's attributes and some; properties that is outside the “attributes” term, but still could make the; function different without changing its body. This part of the comparison is; usually done within simple *cmpNumbers* or *cmpFlags* operations (e.g.; ``cmpFlags(F1->hasGC(), F2->hasGC())``). Below is a full list of function's; properties to be compared on this stage:. * *Attributes* (those are returned by ``Function::getAttributes()``; method). * *GC*, for equivalence, *RHS* and *LHS* should be bot",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst:11476,perform,perform,11476,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"ils. AArch64 has `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware feature that allows; software to use the 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer as; a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_; to implement a memory safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but with smaller memory overhead and slightly different (mostly better); accuracy guarantees. Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch. For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of size between 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule. Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag. This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst:1723,load,load,1723,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,1,['load'],['load']

If the number of; cores can't be computed for the architecture, then it will launch; ``std::thread::hardware_concurrency`` number of threads in parallel.; For machines with hyper-threading, this is the total number of; virtual cores.

The result is a little bit more complicated than we may expect; because LoopRotate ensures that the loop is in; :ref:`Loop Simplify Form <loop-terminology-loop-simplify>`; after rotation.; In this case, it inserted the %loop.preheader basic block so; that the loop has a preheader and it introduced the %loop.exit; basic block so that the loop has dedicated exits; (otherwise, %exit would be jumped from both %latch and %entry,; but %entry is not contained in the loop).; Note that a loop has to be in Loop Simplify Form beforehand; too for LoopRotate to be applied successfully. The main advantage of this form is that it allows hoisting; invariant instructions, especially loads, into the preheader.; That could be done in non-rotated loops as well but with; some disadvantages. Let's illustrate them with an example:. .. code-block:: C. for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; auto v = *p;; use(v);; }. We assume that loading from p is invariant and use(v) is some; statement that uses v.; If we wanted to execute the load only once we could move it; ""out"" of the loop body, resulting in this:. .. code-block:: C. auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }. However, now, in the case that n <= 0, in the initial form,; the loop body would never execute, and so, the load would; never execute. This is a problem mainly for semantic reasons.; Consider the case in which n <= 0 and loading from p is invalid.; In the initial program there would be no error. However, with this; transformation we would introduce one, effectively breaking; the initial semantics. To avoid both of these problems, we can insert a guard:. .. code-block:: C. if (n > 0) { // loop guard; auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }; }.

In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`.

Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count. Using this information, ``ConstraintElimination`` is able; to determine ``p + count`` doesn’t wrap.; * Accordingly, ``p + i`` and ``p + i + 1`` also don’t wrap.; * Therefore, ``p <= p + i`` and ``p + i + 1 <= p + count``.; * The if-condition simplifies to false and becomes dead code that the subsequent; optimization passes can remove. ``OptRemarks`` can be utilized to provide insights into performance tuning.

Performance,"imization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger.

Performance,"imizations that Result in Concurrent Iteration Execution; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. A compiler can perform loop optimizations that result in the generated code; executing multiple iterations concurrently. For example, software pipelining; schedules multiple iterations in an interleaved fashion to allow the; instructions of one iteration to hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language loop iterations are executing ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:33618,concurren,concurrency,33618,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,3,"['concurren', 'optimiz']","['concurrency', 'optimizations']"
Performance,"in a; unique section. It will also place all basic blocks of functions ``bar``; in unique sections. Further, section clusters can also be specified using the ``list=<arg>``; option. For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` contains:. ::. !foo; !!1 !!3 !!5; !!2 !!4 !!6. will create two unique sections for function ``foo`` with the first; containing the odd numbered basic blocks and the second containing the; even numbered basic blocks. Basic block sections allow the linker to reorder basic blocks and enables; link-time optimizations like whole program inter-procedural basic block; reordering. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile information enables better optimization. For example, knowing that a; branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better decisions when; ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation. Regardless of which kind of profiling you use, be careful to collect profiles; by running your code with inputs that are representative of the typical; behavior. Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling.

Performance,"in other contextual elements, never the ``%s`` string. The; ``module`` element defining a module ID must always be emitted before any; other elements that refer to that module ID, so that a filter never needs to; keep track of dangling references. The second ``%s`` is the module type and it; determines what the remaining fields are. The following module types are; supported:. * ``elf:%x``. Here ``%x`` encodes an ELF Build ID. The Build ID should refer to a single; linked binary. The Build ID string is the sole way to identify the binary from; which this module was loaded. Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:20452,load,load,20452,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['load'],['load']

This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:.

In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer held in; a ``__strong`` object will be retained for the full formal lifetime of the; object. Objects subject to this invariant have :arc-term:`precise lifetime; semantics`. By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do not have precise; lifetime semantics.

Performance,"ind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space.

This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR.

First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in. Once all of the alias sets are completed, your pass should; simply iterate through the constructed alias sets, using the ``AliasSetTracker``; ``begin()``/``end()`` methods. The ``AliasSet``\s formed by the ``AliasSetTracker`` are guaranteed to be; disjoint, calculate mod/ref information and volatility for the set, and keep; track of whether or not all of the pointers in the set are Must aliases. The; AliasSetTracker also makes sure that sets are properly folded due to call; instructions, and can provide a list of pointers in each set. As an example user of this, the `Loop Invariant Code Motion; <doxygen/structLICM.html>`_ pass uses ``AliasSetTracker``\s to calculate alias; sets for each loop nest. If an ``AliasSet`` in a loop is not modified, then all; load instructions from that set may be hoisted out of the loop. If any alias; sets are stored to **and** are must alias sets, then the stores may be sunk; to outside of the loop, promoting the memory location to a register for the; duration of the loop nest. Both of these transformations only apply if the; pointer argument is loop-invariant. The AliasSetTracker implementation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

We expect the memory after `SmallVectorBase` to be; occupied by the small inline buffer. `SmallVectorTemplateCommon<T>`; - `getFirstEl()`: returns the address of the beginning of the small buffer; - `begin()`, `end()`, `front()`, `back()`, etc. Basically the same as the corresponding LLVM class.; It contains the parts that are independent of whether T is a POD or not. `SmallVectorTemplateBase<T, bool TriviallyCopiable>` and the specialization `SmallVectorTemplateBase<T, true>`; - `grow()`, `uninitialized_copy`, `uninitialized_move`, `push_back()`, `pop_back()`.

Performance,"ing instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:30245,load,load,30245,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"ing launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead. The compile callback will; compile the function, update the function pointer for the stub, then execute; the function. On all subsequent calls to the function, the function pointer; will point at the already-compiled function, so there is no further overhead; from the compiler.

For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

Performance,"ing optimization for a range of function definitions, a; range-based pragma is provided. Its syntax is ``#pragma clang optimize``; followed by ``off`` or ``on``. All function definitions in the region between an ``off`` and the following; ``on`` will be decorated with the ``optnone`` attribute unless doing so would; conflict with explicit attributes already present on the function (e.g. the; ones that control inlining). .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang optimize off; // This function will be decorated with optnone.; int foo() {; // ... code; }. // optnone conflicts with always_inline, so bar() will not be decorated.; __attribute__((always_inline)) int bar() {; // ... code; }; #pragma clang optimize on. If no ``on`` is found to close an ``off`` region, the end of the region is the; end of the compilation unit. Note that a stray ``#pragma clang optimize on`` does not selectively enable; additional optimizations when compiling at low optimization levels. This feature; can only be used to selectively disable optimizations. The pragma has an effect on functions only at the point of their definition; for; function templates, this means that the state of the pragma at the point of an; instantiation is not necessarily relevant. Consider the following example:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T> T twice(T t) {; return 2 * t;; }. #pragma clang optimize off; template<typename T> T thrice(T t) {; return 3 * t;; }. int container(int a, int b) {; return twice(a) + thrice(b);; }; #pragma clang optimize on. In this example, the definition of the template function ``twice`` is outside; the pragma region, whereas the definition of ``thrice`` is inside the region.; The ``container`` function is also in the region and will not be optimized, but; it causes the instantiation of ``twice`` and ``thrice`` with an ``int`` type; of; these two instantiations, ``twice`` will be optimized (because its definition; was outside the region) and ``thrice`` will not be optimized.

Performance,"ing optimizer support to your; language, and adding JIT compiler support. These additions will; demonstrate how to get nice, efficient code for the Kaleidoscope; language. Trivial Constant Folding; ========================. Our demonstration for Chapter 3 is elegant and easy to extend.; Unfortunately, it does not produce wonderful code. The IRBuilder,; however, does give us obvious optimizations when compiling simple code:. ::. ready> def test(x) 1+2+x;; Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double 3.000000e+00, %x; ret double %addtmp; }. This code is not a literal transcription of the AST built by parsing the; input. That would be:. ::. ready> def test(x) 1+2+x;; Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double 2.000000e+00, 1.000000e+00; %addtmp1 = fadd double %addtmp, %x; ret double %addtmp1; }. Constant folding, as seen above, in particular, is a very common and; very important optimization: so much so that many language implementors; implement constant folding support in their AST representation. With LLVM, you don't need this support in the AST. Since all calls to; build LLVM IR go through the LLVM IR builder, the builder itself checked; to see if there was a constant folding opportunity when you call it. If; so, it just does the constant fold and return the constant instead of; creating an instruction. Well, that was easy :). In practice, we recommend always using; ``IRBuilder`` when generating code like this. It has no ""syntactic; overhead"" for its use (you don't have to uglify your compiler with; constant checks everywhere) and it can dramatically reduce the amount of; LLVM IR that is generated in some cases (particular for languages with a; macro preprocessor or that use a lot of constants). On the other hand, the ``IRBuilder`` is limited by the fact that it does; all of its analysis inline with the code as it is built. If you take a; slightly more complex example:. ::.

The ROOT Linear algebra package is documented in a separate chapter (see; ""Linear Algebra in ROOT""). `SMatrix` is a C++ package, for high; performance vector and matrix computations. It has been introduced in; ROOT v5.08. It is optimized for describing small matrices and vectors; and It can be used only in problems when the size of the matrices is; known at compile time, like in the tracking reconstruction of physics; experiments. It is based on a C++ technique, called expression; templates, to achieve an high level optimization. The C++ templates can; be used to implement vector and matrix expressions such that these; expressions can be transformed at compile time to code which is; equivalent to hand optimized code in a low-level language like FORTRAN; or C (see for example T. Veldhuizen, Expression Templates, C++ Report,; 1995). The `SMatrix` has been developed initially by T. Glebe in; Max-Planck-Institut, Heidelberg, as part of the `HeraB` analysis; framework. A subset of the original package has been now incorporated in; the ROOT distribution, with the aim to provide a stand-alone and high; performance matrix package.

There are also CMake caches available to build; LLVM/Clang with BOLT. To configure a single-stage build that builds LLVM/Clang and then optimizes; it with BOLT, use the following CMake configuration:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake <path to source>/llvm -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/BOLT.cmake. Then, build the BOLT-optimized binary by running the following ninja command:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja clang-bolt. If you're seeing errors in the build process, try building with a recent; version of Clang/LLVM by setting the CMAKE_C_COMPILER and; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER flags to the appropriate values. It is also possible to use BOLT on top of PGO and (Thin)LTO for an even more; significant runtime speedup. To configure a three stage PGO build with ThinLTO; that optimizes the resulting binary with BOLT, use the following CMake; configuration command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja <path to source>/llvm \; -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/BOLT-PGO.cmake \; -DBOOTSTRAP_LLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON \; -DBOOTSTRAP_BOOTSTRAP_LLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin.

Almost all those pressure increase events were; caused by contention on processor resources JFPA/JFPU0. The `critical sequence` is the most expensive sequence of instructions according; to the simulation. It is annotated to provide extra information about critical; register dependencies and resource interferences between instructions. Instructions from the critical sequence are expected to significantly impact; performance.

A single option can be given as a parameter, that is; used to determine which procedure is chosen. The remaining option string is then; passed through to the calculation, if applicable. Several examples illustrate how to use this class. See:; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/ratioplot?.C`. * New option ""I"" allowing to draw TGraph with invisible axis (used by `TRatioPlot`);. ## New histogram drawing options. ### COL2; COL2 is a new rendering technique providing potential performance improvements; compared to the standard COL option. The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero.

Performance,"ing. It is relatively easy to compile a macro, either as a pre-compiled; library to load into ROOT, or as a stand-alone application, by adding; some include statements for header file or some ""dressing code"" to any; macro. ## General Remarks on ROOT macros ##. If you have a number of lines which you were able to execute at the ROOT; prompt, they can be turned into a ROOT macro by giving them a name which; corresponds to the file name without extension. The general structure; for a macro stored in file `MacroName.C` is. ``` {.cpp}; void MacroName() {; < ...; your lines of C++ code; ... >; }; ```. The macro is executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > root MacroName.C; ```. at the system prompt, or executed using `.x`. ``` {.cpp}; > root; root [0] .x MacroName.C; ```. at the ROOT prompt. or it can be loaded into a ROOT session and then; be executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; root [0].L MacroName.C; root [1] MacroName();; ```. at the ROOT prompt. Note that more than one macro can be loaded this; way, as each macro has a unique name in the ROOT name space. A small set; of options can help making your plot nicer. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->SetStyle(""Plain""); // set plain TStyle; gStyle->SetOptStat(111111); // draw statistics on plots,; // (0) for no output; gStyle->SetOptFit(1111); // draw fit results on plot,; // (0) for no ouput; gStyle->SetPalette(57); // set color map; gStyle->SetOptTitle(0); // suppress title box; ...; ```. Next, you should create a canvas for graphical output, with size,; subdivisions and format suitable to your needs, see documentation of; class `TCanvas`:. ``` {.cpp}; TCanvas c1(""c1"",""<Title>"",0,0,400,300); // create a canvas, specify position and size in pixels; c1.Divide(2,2); //set subdivisions, called pads; c1.cd(1); //change to pad 1 of canvas c1; ```.

Performance,"ing; `RooFit` classes as well as custom implementations you might be using. ### Native and proxy-based importers and exporters. `RooFitHS3` allows to different types of importers and exporters:; *Native* implementations, and *proxy-based* ones. If for a certain; class several implementations are provided, the native; implementation(s) take precedence. ### Writing your own importers and exporters: Proxy-based. Proxy-based implementations can be added very easily and without; actually writing any `C++` code -- you only need to add a short item; to a list in a `JSON` file, namely the; [export keys](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsexportkeys.json); for an exporter, or the; [factory expressions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsfactoryexpressions.json); for an importer. This works in the following way: Every `RooFit` class performs; dependency tracking via proxies, which have names. This can be; exploited to perform the mapping of proxy names to `json` keys upon; export. In the other direction, the `RooWorkspace` has a factory; interface that allows to call any constructor via a string; interface. Hence:; - If a `RooFit` class has no other members aside from proxies, it can; be exported using a set of `export keys`.; - If all relevant members to a `RooFit` class are passed as; constructor arguments, it can be imported using a `factory; expression`.

Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize.

This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm.

No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward.

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA.

In the example above, every variable assignment uniquely corresponds to a; memory store to the variable's position on the stack. However in heavily; optimized code LLVM promotes most variables into SSA values, which can; eventually be placed in physical registers or memory locations. To track SSA; values through compilation, when objects are promoted to SSA values an; ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic is created for each assignment, recording the; variable's new location. Compared with the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic:. * A dbg.value terminates the effect of any preceding dbg.values for (any; overlapping fragments of) the specified variable.; * The dbg.value's position in the IR defines where in the instruction stream; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value.

The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method.

Performance,"instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and; fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call; to fit the histogram, the ""fitter"" will dynamically load libMinuit if; it is not yet loaded. #### Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking. plugin manager The Plugin Manager **`TPluginManager`** allows; postponing library dependencies to runtime: a plugin library will only; be loaded when it is needed. Non-plugins will need to be linked, and; are thus loaded at start-up.

Performance,"instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible. In that case, we need to preserve; the flags around these instructions:; ```; ... .LBB",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:31476,load,loading,31476,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loading']

In the above, the values of `v` and `a` are clearly expressed, as are the; temporary values for `await_counter` (`class_await_counter_1` and; `class_await_counter_2`) and `std::suspend_always` (; `struct_std__suspend_always_0` and `struct_std__suspend_always_3`). The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`. Note that the; first initial suspend point is the compiler generated; `co_await promise_type::initial_suspend()`.

Unused values are optimized out, as well as the name of the local variable `a`.; The only information remained is the value of a 32 bit integer. In this simple; case, it seems to be pretty clear that `__int_32_0` represents `a`. However, it; is not true. An important note with optimization is that the value of a variable may not; properly express the intended value in the source code.

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA.

Performance,"into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:3186,load,load,3186,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['load']

RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation), but to; fully use vector extensions of modern CPUs, a manual compilation of ROOT was necessary, setting the required compiler flags. Now, RooFit comes with dedicated computation libraries, each compiled for a specific CPU architecture. When RooFit is loaded for the; first time, ROOT inspects the CPU capabilities, and loads the fastest supported version of this computation library.; This means that RooFit can now use vector extensions such as AVX2 without being recompiled, which enables a speed up of up to 4x for certain computations.; Combined with better data access patterns (~3x speed up, ROOT 6.20), computations with optimised PDFs speed up between 4x and 16x. The fast `BatchMode` now also works in combination with multi processing (`NumCPU`) and with binned data (`RooDataHist`).

Constrained Floating-Point Intrinsics; -------------------------------------.

By default, LLVM optimization passes assume that the rounding mode is; round-to-nearest and that floating-point exceptions will not be monitored.; Constrained FP intrinsics are used to support non-default rounding modes and; accurately preserve exception behavior without compromising LLVM's ability to; optimize FP code when the default behavior is used. If any FP operation in a function is constrained then they all must be; constrained. This is required for correct LLVM IR. Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior.

The DWARF would be ill-formed if E is a location list; expression that does not match exactly one location list entry. In all; other cases the evaluation of an expression E that is the value of a; ``DW_AT_location`` attribute would evaluate E with the current context,; except the result kind is a location description, the compilation unit; is the one that contains D, and the initial stack is empty.

To circumvent this, debug numbers of `PHI`s are; recorded at the start of register allocation (`phi-node-elimination`), then; `DBG_PHI` instructions are inserted after regalloc finishes. This requires some; maintenance of which register a variable is located in during regalloc, but at; single positions (block entry points) rather than ranges of instructions. An example, before regalloc:. ```text; bb.2:; %2 = PHI %1, %bb.0, %2, %bb.1, debug-instr-number 1; ```. After:. ```text; bb.2:; DBG_PHI $rax, 1; ```. # `LiveDebugValues`. After optimisations and code layout complete, information about variable; values must be translated into variable locations, i.e. registers and stack; slots. This is performed in the [`LiveDebugValues` pass][LiveDebugValues], where; the debug instructions and machine code are separated out into two independent; functions:; * One that assigns values to variable names,; * One that assigns values to machine registers and stack slots. LLVM's existing SSA tools are used to place `PHI`s for each function, between; variable values and the values contained in machine locations, with value; propagation eliminating any unnecessary `PHI`s. The two can then be joined up; to map variables to values, then values to locations, for each instruction in; the function. Key to this process is being able to identify the movement of values between; registers and stack locations, so that the location of values can be preserved; for the full time that they are resident in the machine. # Required target support and transition guide.

A note about Floating Point Constant Evaluation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, the only place floating point operations are guaranteed to be evaluated; during translation is in the initializers of variables of static storage; duration, which are all notionally initialized before the program begins; executing (and thus before a non-default floating point environment can be; entered). But C++ has many more contexts where floating point constant; evaluation occurs. Specifically: for static/thread-local variables,; first try evaluating the initializer in a constant context, including in the; constant floating point environment (just like in C), and then, if that fails,; fall back to emitting runtime code to perform the initialization (which might; in general be in a different floating point environment). Consider this example when compiled with ``-frounding-math``. .. code-block:: console. constexpr float func_01(float x, float y) {; return x + y;; }; float V1 = func_01(1.0F, 0x0.000001p0F);.

Performance,"ion outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions.

For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline.

Performance,"ion when performed during the link stage. This document describes the; interface and design between the LTO optimizer and the linker. Design Philosophy; =================. The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document.

Performance,"ion"". Here are a few observations about this:. First, you're right that LLVM does lose information. For example, as of; this writing, there is no way to distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an; SSA-value came from a C ""int"" or a C ""long"" on an ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR.

The method also compares: Constants that are of the; same type and if right constant can be losslessly bit-casted to the left; one, then we also compare them. How to implement cmpValues?; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; *Association* is a case of equality for us. We just treat such values as equal,; but, in general, we need to implement antisymmetric relation. As mentioned; above, to understand what is *less*, we can use order in which we; meet values. If both values have the same order in a function (met at the same; time), we then treat values as *associated*. Otherwise – it depends on who was; first. Every time we run the top-level compare method, we initialize two identical; maps (one for the left side, another one for the right side):. ``map<Value, int> sn_mapL, sn_mapR;``. The key of the map is the *Value* itself, the *value* – is its order (call it; *serial number*). To add value *V* we need to perform the next procedure:. ``sn_map.insert(std::make_pair(V, sn_map.size()));``. For the first *Value*, map will return *0*, for the second *Value* map will; return *1*, and so on. We can then check whether left and right values met at the same time with; a simple comparison:. ``cmpNumbers(sn_mapL[Left], sn_mapR[Right]);``. Of course, we can combine insertion and comparison:. .. code-block:: c++. std::pair<iterator, bool>; LeftRes = sn_mapL.insert(std::make_pair(Left, sn_mapL.size())), RightRes; = sn_mapR.insert(std::make_pair(Right, sn_mapR.size()));; return cmpNumbers(LeftRes.first->second, RightRes.first->second);.

For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` is the; following:. ::. !foo; !!2; !_Z3barv. will place the machine basic block with ``id 2`` in function ``foo`` in a; unique section. It will also place all basic blocks of functions ``bar``; in unique sections. Further, section clusters can also be specified using the ``list=<arg>``; option. For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` contains:. ::. !foo; !!1 !!3 !!5; !!2 !!4 !!6. will create two unique sections for function ``foo`` with the first; containing the odd numbered basic blocks and the second containing the; even numbered basic blocks.

For example, knowing that a; branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better decisions when; ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation.

Performance,"ion; =================================================. Clang provides a mechanism for selectively disabling optimizations in functions; and methods. To disable optimizations in a single function definition, the GNU-style or C++11; non-standard attribute ``optnone`` can be used. .. code-block:: c++. // The following functions will not be optimized.; // GNU-style attribute; __attribute__((optnone)) int foo() {; // ... code; }; // C++11 attribute; [[clang::optnone]] int bar() {; // ... code; }. To facilitate disabling optimization for a range of function definitions, a; range-based pragma is provided. Its syntax is ``#pragma clang optimize``; followed by ``off`` or ``on``. All function definitions in the region between an ``off`` and the following; ``on`` will be decorated with the ``optnone`` attribute unless doing so would; conflict with explicit attributes already present on the function (e.g. the; ones that control inlining). .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang optimize off; // This function will be decorated with optnone.; int foo() {; // ... code; }. // optnone conflicts with always_inline, so bar() will not be decorated.; __attribute__((always_inline)) int bar() {; // ... code; }; #pragma clang optimize on. If no ``on`` is found to close an ``off`` region, the end of the region is the; end of the compilation unit. Note that a stray ``#pragma clang optimize on`` does not selectively enable; additional optimizations when compiling at low optimization levels. This feature; can only be used to selectively disable optimizations. The pragma has an effect on functions only at the point of their definition; for; function templates, this means that the state of the pragma at the point of an; instantiation is not necessarily relevant. Consider the following example:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T> T twice(T t) {; return 2 * t;; }. #pragma clang optimize off; template<typename T> T thrice(T t) {; return 3 * t;; }. int container(int a, int b) {; return twice(a) + ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:159477,optimiz,optimize,159477,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']

This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```.

Front-ends must honour; these restrictions when generating LLVM IR. Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not. If we let the compiler insert the appropriate ``smstart``; and ``smstop`` instructions around call boundaries, then the effects on SVE; state can be mitigated. By limiting the state changes to a very brief window; around the call we can control how the operations are scheduled and how live; values remain preserved between state transitions. In order to control PSTATE.SM at this level of granularity, we use function and; callsite attributes rather than intrinsics. Restrictions on attributes; --------------------------. * It is undefined behaviour to pass or return (pointers to) scalable vector; objects to/from functions which may use a different SVE vector length.; This includes functions with a non-streaming interface, but marked with; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` and ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_preserved``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_shared``. These restrictions also apply in the higher level SME ACLE, which means we can; emit diagnostics in Clang to signal users about incorrect behaviour.

Since; this is a **`TObject`**'s method, every object may be ""drawn"", which; means attached to a pad. When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object; that derives from **`TObject`** has a `Paint()` method. It may be empty,; but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to; paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of; objects it owns, it will call successively the `Paint()` method of each; object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen.

The implementation of data stored in RooDataSet and RooDataHist; was historically handled by ROOT TTrees (though class RooTreeDataStore). The default storage type; has now been changed to class RooVectorDataStore which stores the information in STL arrays. Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees.

Performance,"is document covers how to integrate LLVM into a compiler for a language which; supports garbage collection. **Note that LLVM itself does not provide a; garbage collector.** You must provide your own. Quick Start; ============. First, you should pick a collector strategy. LLVM includes a number of built; in ones, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to know about) in your generated IR, so that LLVM can encode them into; your final stack maps.

The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; As a rule of thumb, if about 10% of classes are used, it takes several; hundreds of bound classes before the cppyy-approach is beneficial.; In High Energy Physics, from which it originated, cppyy is regularly used in; software stacks of many thousands of classes, where this advantage is very; important. `Distributing headers`; ----------------------. cppyy requires C/C++ headers to be available at run-time, which was never a; problem in the developer-centric world from which it originated: software; always had supported C++ APIs already, made available through header files,; and Python simply piggy-backed onto those.; JIT-ing code in those headers, which potentially picked up system headers; that were configured",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:9015,load,loading,9015,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['load'],['loading']

Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view. Our goal is to take advantage of tight; integration between the linker and the optimizer by sharing this information; during various linking phases. Phase 1 : Read LLVM Bitcode Files; ---------------------------------. The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implem",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:5139,optimiz,optimizer,5139,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,2,['optimiz'],['optimizer']

Load/Store Unit and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``-noalias`` is the; only option).

If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.01; }. The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases.

Performance,"is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores. However, as most stores aren't interesting and don't; inherently leak data, this is expected to be prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details. There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These cond",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15206,load,loads,15206,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']

For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm. Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper(",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:59933,optimiz,optimization,59933,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using an HSA; compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`), in which AQL packets (all of which; are 64 bytes) can be placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3.

Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process.

Performance,"istribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools.

Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``.

Composite shapes can be subsequently used for defining volumes.; Moreover, these volumes contain other volumes, following the general; criteria. Volumes created based on composite shapes cannot be divided. ### Navigation Methods Performed By Shapes. Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the `manager class`; at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes; can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed.; Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation; stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes; may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible; once volumes were defined based on it. The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are; performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific; algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note; that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry.; However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; ```. The method above returns `kTRUE` if the point \*point is actually inside; the shape. The point has to be defined in the local shape reference.

If no match is found, and the type sought is an integer type, then; the smallest integer type that is larger than the bitwidth of the; sought type is used. If none of the specifications are larger than; the bitwidth then the largest integer type is used. For example,; given the default specifications above, the i7 type will use the; alignment of i8 (next largest) while both i65 and i256 will use the; alignment of i64 (largest specified). The function of the data layout string may not be what you expect.; Notably, this is not a specification from the frontend of what alignment; the code generator should use. Instead, if specified, the target data layout is required to match what; the ultimate *code generator* expects. This string is used by the; mid-level optimizers to improve code, and this only works if it matches; what the ultimate code generator uses.

Performance,"it and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``-noalias`` is the; only option). Essentially, there is no option to specify a different memory; type (e.g., write-back, write-combining, write-through; etc.) and consequently; to weaken, or strengthen, the memory model. Other limitations are:. * The LSUnit does not know when store-to-load forwarding may occur.; * The LSUnit does not know anything about cache hierarchy and memory types.; * The LSUnit does not know how to identify serializing operations and memory; fences.

Although we tend to talk about them as distinct passes, it should be noted that; there's a good deal of flexibility here and it's ok for things to happen; earlier than described below. For example, it's not unusual for the legalizer to; legalize an intrinsic directly to a target instruction. The concrete; requirement is that the following additional constraints are preserved after; each of these passes:. IRTranslator. The representation must be gMIR, MIR, or a mixture of the two after this pass.; The majority will typically be gMIR to begin with but later passes will; gradually transition the gMIR to MIR. Legalizer. No illegal operations must remain or be introduced after this pass. Register Bank Selector. All virtual registers must have a register bank assigned after this pass. Instruction Select. No gMIR must remain or be introduced after this pass. In other words, we must; have completed the conversion from gMIR to MIR. In addition to these passes, there are also some optional passes that perform; an optimization. The current optional passes are:. Combiner. Replaces patterns of instructions with a better alternative. Typically, this; means improving run time performance by replacing instructions with faster; alternatives but Combiners can also focus on code size or other metrics. Additional passes such as these can be inserted to support higher optimization; levels or target specific needs. A likely pipeline is:. .. image:: pipeline-overview-with-combiners.png.

Performance,"it vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``.

The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence which instruction is best to use). ..

Virtual containers are volumes that do not represent real objects, but; they are needed for grouping and positioning together other volumes.; Such grouping helps not only geometry creation, but also optimizes; tracking performance; therefore, it is highly recommended. Virtual; volumes need to inherit material/medium properties from the volume they; are placed into in order to be ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`. What we need to do is to create a virtual container volume `C`; holding `A` and `B`, then position `C` in the other volumes. Note that `C` is a volume having a determined medium. Since it is not a; real volume, we need to manually set its medium the same as that of; `D,E` or `F` in order to make it ‘invisible' (same physics properties).; In other words, the limitation in proceeding this way is that `D,E,` and; `F` must point to the same medium. If this was not the case, we would; have to define different virtual volumes for each placement: `C`, `C'`; and `C""`, having the same shape but different media matching the; corresponding conta",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:69850,optimiz,optimizes,69850,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimizes', 'performance']"

RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject begins by creating an ObjectImage instance; from the ObjectBuffer it received. ObjectImage, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use.

In order to allow removing unused function pointers from vtables, we need to; know whether every virtual call which could use it is known to the compiler, or; whether another translation unit could introduce more calls through the vtable.; This is not the same as the linkage of the vtable, because call sites could be; using a pointer of a more widely-visible base class. For example, consider this; code:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((visibility(""default""))); struct A {; virtual void f();; };. __attribute__((visibility(""hidden""))); struct B : A {; virtual void f();; };. With LTO, we know that all code which can see the declaration of ``B`` is; visible to us. However, a pointer to a ``B`` could be cast to ``A*`` and passed; to another linkage unit, which could then call ``f`` on it. This call would; load from the vtable for ``B`` (using the object pointer), and then call; ``B::f``. This means we can't remove the function pointer from ``B``'s vtable,; or the implementation of ``B::f``. However, if we can see all code which knows; about any dynamic base class (which would be the case if ``B`` only inherited; from classes with hidden visibility), then this optimisation would be valid.

However, this is not; proposed since currently the arithmetic operations are defined to require values; of the same base type and produces a result with the same base type. Allowing; these operations to act on location descriptions would permit the first operand; to be a location description and the second operand to be an integral value; type, or vice versa, and return a location description. This complicates the; rules for implicit conversions between default address space memory location; descriptions and generic base type values. Currently the rules would convert; such a location description to the memory address value and then perform two's; compliment wrap around arithmetic. If the result was used as a location; description, it would be implicitly converted back to a default address space; memory location description.

If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Currently, these sorts of things are modelled by compiling a function to return; the small type and a signext/zeroext marker is used. For example, we compile; Z into:. define i32 @z() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call signext i16 (...)* @y() nounwind; 	%1 = sext i16 %0 to i32; 	ret i32 %1; }. and b into:. define signext i16 @b() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call i32 (...)* @a() nounwind		; <i32> [#uses=1]; 	%retval12 = trunc i32 %0 to i16		; <i16> [#uses=1]; 	ret i16 %retval12; }.

Performance,"its, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence which instruction is best to use). ..

Performance,"ivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps.

While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```.

Whether threads are *converged* or not depends on the paths they take; through the control flow graph. Threads take different outgoing edges; at a *divergent branch*. Divergent branches constrain; program transforms such as changing the CFG or moving a convergent; operation to a different point of the CFG. Performing these; transformations across a divergent branch can change the sets of; threads that execute convergent operations convergently. While these; constraints are out of scope for this document, the described; *uniformity analysis* allows these transformations to identify; uniform branches where these constraints do not hold. Convergence and; uniformity are inter-dependent: When threads diverge at a divergent; branch, they may later *reconverge* at a common program point.; Subsequent operations are performed convergently, but the inputs may; be non-uniform, thus producing divergent outputs. Uniformity is also useful by itself on targets that execute threads in; groups with shared execution resources (e.g. waves, warps, or; subgroups):. - Uniform outputs can potentially be computed or stored on shared; resources.; - These targets must ""linearize"" a divergent branch to ensure that; each side of the branch is followed by the corresponding threads in; the same group.

It would be very unfortunate if we end up with worse performance after using modules.; The main concern is that when we compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the function body; of imported module units so that it can perform IPO (InterProcedural Optimization, primarily inlining; in practice) to optimize functions in current source file with the help of the information provided by; the imported module units.; In other words, the imported code would be processed again and again in importee units; by optimizations (including IPO itself).; The optimizations before IPO and the IPO itself are the most time-consuming part in whole compilation process.; So from this perspective, we might not be able to get the improvements described in the theory.; But we could still save the time for optimizations after IPO and the whole backend.

If calling a function which is known to throw an exception (unwind), use; an invoke with a normal destination which contains an unreachable; instruction. This form conveys to the optimizer that the call returns; abnormally. For an invoke which neither returns normally or requires unwind; code in the current function, you can use a noreturn call instruction if; desired.

When generating code for loops, try to avoid terminating the header block of; the loop earlier than necessary. If the terminator of the loop header; block is a loop exiting conditional branch, the effectiveness of LICM will; be limited for loads not in the header. (This is due to the fact that LLVM; may not know such a load is safe to speculatively execute and thus can't; lift an otherwise loop invariant load unless it can prove the exiting; condition is not taken.) It can be profitable, in some cases, to emit such; instructions into the header even if they are not used along a rarely; executed path that exits the loop.

If needed, you can explicitly destroy a ROOT object that you own through; its associated **`TClass`**:. ``` {.cpp}; myobject.IsA().Destructor(myobject); ```. which will send out the deletion notification to the system (thus you do; not need to care anymore at this point about Python reference counting,; the object will go, even if it's reference count it non-zero), and free; the memory. ### Performance. The performance of `PyROOT` when programming with ROOT in Python is; similar to that of Cling. Differences occur mainly because of differences; in the respective languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once; parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to; ROOT are typically faster from `PyROOT`, whereas loops are typically; slower. When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider; performance generally ""good enough"" on the outset, and when it turns out; that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs.

You gain; space on the file, and you do not loose functionality if you do not use; the `fBits` and `fUniqueID. `See ""The Role of TObject"" on the use of; `fBits` and `fUniqueID`. ### Streaming a TClonesArray. When writing a **`TClonesArray`** it bypasses by default the; `Streamer `of the member class and uses a more efficient internal; mechanism to write the members to the file. You can override the default; and specify that the member class `Streamer `is used by setting the; `TClonesArray::BypassStreamer` bit to false:. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray *fTracks;; fTracks->BypassStreamer(kFALSE); // use the member Streamer; ```. When the `kBypassStreamer` bit is set, the automatically generated; `Streamer `can call directly the method **`TClass::WriteBuffer`**.; Bypassing the `Streamer` improves the performance when writing/reading; the objects in the **`TClonesArray`**. However, the drawback is when a; **`TClonesArray`** is written with `split=0` bypassing the `Streamer`,; the `StreamerInfo `of the class in the array being optimized, one cannot; later use the **`TClonesArray`** with `split > 0`. For example, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`.

Performance,"jectLayer to link the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

For sake of discussion, I'm going to assume that you are debugging a; transformation invoked by :program:`opt`, although nothing described here; depends on that. Setting a breakpoint in your pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. First thing you do is start gdb on the opt process:. .. code-block:: console. $ gdb opt; GNU gdb 5.0; Copyright 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.; GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are; welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.; Type ""show copying"" to see the conditions.; There is absolutely no warranty for GDB. Type ""show warranty"" for details.; This GDB was configured as ""sparc-sun-solaris2.6""...; (gdb). Note that :program:`opt` has a lot of debugging information in it, so it takes; time to load. Be patient. Since we cannot set a breakpoint in our pass yet; (the shared object isn't loaded until runtime), we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb).

Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"".

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`. To do the same from `TTree::CopyEntries` add to the option string ""cachesize=SIZE"". To update the size of the cache or disable it from `hadd`, use the command line option `-cachesize SIZE`. `SIZE` shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in 'human readable form' (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. ### Other Changes. * Update `TChain::LoadTree` so that the user call back routine is actually called for each input file even those containing `TTree` objects with no entries.; * Repair setting the branch address of a leaflist style branch taking directly the address of the struct.

A mismatch of features may result in incorrect; execution, or a reduction in performance. The target features supported by each processor is listed in; :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`.

Performance,"ker symbols*.; All cppyy uses, the basic and the more advanced, are variations on the; theme of bringing these two together at the point of use. Definitions typically live in header files and symbols in libraries.; Headers can be loaded with ``cppyy.include`` and libraries with the; ``cppyy.load_library`` call.; Loading the header is sufficient to start exploring, with ``cppyy.gbl`` the; starting point of all things C++, while the linker symbols are only needed at ; the point of first use. Here is an example using the `zlib`_ library, which is likely available on; your system:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('zlib.h') # bring in C++ definitions; >>> cppyy.load_library('libz') # load linker symbols; >>> cppyy.gbl.zlibVersion() # use a zlib API; '1.2.11'; >>>. Since header files can include other header files, it is easy to aggregate; all relevant ones into a single header to include.; If there are project-specific include paths, you can add those paths through; ``cppyy.add_include_path``.; If a header is C-only and not set for use with C++, use ``cppyy.c_include``,; which adds ``extern ""C""`` around the header. Library files can be aggregated by linking all relevant ones to a single; library to load.; Using the linker for this purpose allows regular system features such as; ``rpath`` and envars such as ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to be applied as usual.; Note that any mechanism that exposes the library symbols will work.; For example, you could also use the standard module ``ctypes`` through; ``ctypes.CDLL`` with the ``ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL`` option. To explore, start from ``cppyy.gbl`` to access your namespaces, classes,; functions, etc., etc. directly; or use python's ``dir`` (or tab-completion); to see what is available.; Use python's ``help`` to see list the methods and data members of classes and; see the interfaces of functions.

Performance,"l %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels.

The case where the pointer is actually null (i.e. the ""failing""; case) is extremely rare. 2. The failing path heals the implicit null check into an explicit; null check so that the application does not repeatedly page; fault.

This stage (in conjunction with the Translate stage) turns the tree; of Actions into a list of actual subprocess to run. Conceptually, the; driver performs a top down matching to assign Action(s) to Tools. The; ToolChain is responsible for selecting the tool to perform a; particular action; once selected the driver interacts with the tool; to see if it can match additional actions (for example, by having an; integrated preprocessor). Once Tools have been selected for all actions, the driver determines; how the tools should be connected (for example, using an inprocess; module, pipes, temporary files, or user provided filenames). If an; output file is required, the driver also computes the appropriate; file name (the suffix and file location depend on the input types and; options such as ``-save-temps``). The driver interacts with a ToolChain to perform the Tool bindings.; Each ToolChain contains information about all the tools needed for; compilation for a particular architecture, platform, and operating; system.

Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``).

More aggressive unrolling and; inlining also promote other optimizations, such as constant propagation and; SROA, which sometimes speed up code by over 10x.

Performance,"l. ## Status and usage. **Status**: Experimental work in progress. Enabling is strongly advised against; except for development and testing. **Enable in Clang**: `-Xclang -fexperimental-assignment-tracking`. That causes Clang to get LLVM to run the pass `declare-to-assign`. The pass; converts conventional debug intrinsics to assignment tracking metadata and sets; the module flag `debug-info-assignment-tracking` to the value `i1 true`. To; check whether assignment tracking is enabled for a module call; `isAssignmentTrackingEnabled(const Module &M)` (from `llvm/IR/DebugInfo.h`). ## Design and implementation. ### Assignment markers: `llvm.dbg.assign`. `llvm.dbg.value`, a conventional debug intrinsic, marks out a position in the; IR where a variable takes a particular value. Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment. That way, the position of the; store and marker can be considered together when making that choice. Another; important benefit of referring to the store is that we can then build a two-way; mapping of stores<->markers that can be used to find markers that need to be; updated when stores are modified. An `llvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```.

As a practical consideration, many garbage-collected systems allow code that is; collector-aware (""managed code"") to call code that is not collector-aware; (""unmanaged code"").

Furthermore, it is common that coordinating the transition from; managed to unmanaged code requires extra code generation at the call site to; inform the collector of the transition. In order to support these needs, a; statepoint may be marked as a GC transition, and data that is necessary to; perform the transition (if any) may be provided as additional arguments to the; statepoint. Note that although in many cases statepoints may be inferred to be GC; transitions based on the function symbols involved (e.g. a call from a; function with GC strategy ""foo"" to a function with GC strategy ""bar""),; indirect calls that are also GC transitions must also be supported. This; requirement is the driving force behind the decision to require that GC; transitions are explicitly marked.

Performance,"lISel <https://llvm.org/docs/GlobalISel/index.html>`_ is another; instruction selection framework. .. _SelectionDAG:. Introduction to SelectionDAGs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SelectionDAG provides an abstraction for code representation in a way that; is amenable to instruction selection using automatic techniques; (e.g. dynamic-programming based optimal pattern matching selectors). It is also; well-suited to other phases of code generation; in particular, instruction; scheduling (SelectionDAG's are very close to scheduling DAGs post-selection).; Additionally, the SelectionDAG provides a host representation where a large; variety of very-low-level (but target-independent) `optimizations`_ may be; performed; ones which require extensive information about the instructions; efficiently supported by the target. The SelectionDAG is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph whose nodes are instances of the; ``SDNode`` class. The primary payload of the ``SDNode`` is its operation code; (Opcode) that indicates what operation the node performs and the operands to the; operation. The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow depende",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:34395,perform,performs,34395,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['perform'],['performs']

The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases. The mem2reg optimization; pass is the answer to dealing with mutable variables, and we highly; recommend that you depend on it. Note that mem2reg only works on; variables in certain circumstances:. #. mem2reg is alloca-driven: it looks for allocas and if it can handle; them, it promotes them. It does not apply to global variables or heap; allocations.; #. mem2reg only looks for alloca instructions in the entry block of the; function. Being in the entry block guarantees that the alloca is only; executed once, which makes analysis simpler.; #. mem2reg only promotes allocas whose uses are direct loads and stores.; If the address of the stack object is passed to a function, or if any; funny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers. Note that the ""sroa"" pass is; more powerful and can promote structs, ""unions"", and arrays in many; cases. All of these properties are easy to satisfy for most imperative; languages, and we'll illustrate it below with Kaleidoscope. The final; question you may be asking is: should I bother with this nonsense for my; front-end?

Performance,"lable on Haswell and; Zen processors, there is an instruction for shifting that does not set any; flags: `shrx`. We can use this and the `lea` instruction to implement analogous; code sequences to the above ones. However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions. Fast, single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shrxq %rax, %rsi, %rsi # Shift away bits if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:34575,load,loads,34575,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,"['load', 'optimiz']","['loads', 'optimize']"

If ``callees``; metadata is attached to a call site, and any callee is not among the set of; functions provided by the metadata, the behavior is undefined. The intent of; this metadata is to facilitate optimizations such as indirect-call promotion.; For example, in the code below, the call instruction may only target the; ``add`` or ``sub`` functions:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = call i64 %binop(i64 %x, i64 %y), !callees !0. ...; !0 = !{ptr @add, ptr @sub}.

It converges faster than the awmi; algorithm, however, it is not suitable to fit large number of parameters. ## 1-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRA. The quantity to be minimized in the fitting procedure for one-dimensional spectrum is defined as. $$ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{N-M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{[y_i-f(i,a)]^2}{y_i} $$. where `i` is the channel in the fitted spectrum, `N` is the number of; channels in the fitting subregion, `M` is the number of free parameters,; `y_i` is the content of the `i`-th channel, `a` is a vector of the; parameters being fitted and `f(i,a)` is a fitting or peak shape function. Instead of the weighting coefficient `y_i` in the denominator of the formula; given above, one can use also the value of `f(i,a)`. It is suitable for; data with poor statistics [11], [12]. The third statistic to be optimized, which is implemented in the fitting; functions, is the Maximum Likelihood Method. It is up to the user; to select a suitable statistic.

Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```.

To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores.

A method is in a certain method family if:. * it has a ``objc_method_family`` attribute placing it in that family; or if; not that,; * it does not have an ``objc_method_family`` attribute placing it in a; different or no family, and; * its selector falls into the corresponding selector family, and; * its signature obeys the added restrictions of the method family. A selector is in a certain selector family if, ignoring any leading; underscores, the first component of the selector either consists entirely of; the name of the method family or it begins with that name followed by a; character other than a lowercase letter. For example, ``_perform:with:`` and; ``performWith:`` would fall into the ``perform`` family (if we recognized one),; but ``performing:with`` would not.

In all these cases `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` returns kNone, as it does; for successful addition, indicating it does not require further; information about this object. Hence you should not try to make any; assumptions about what the viewer did with the object. The viewer may; decide to force the client to rebuild (republish) the scene, obtaining a; different collection of objects, if the internal viewer state changes; .e.g. significant camera move.

Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow. As such, it is better to use; SmallVector or Twine as a scratch buffer, but then use std::string to persist; the result. .. _ds_set:.

Trivial instructions between the call and return do not prevent the; transformation from taking place, though currently the analysis cannot; support moving any really useful instructions (only dead ones).; #. This pass transforms functions that are prevented from being tail recursive; by an associative expression to use an accumulator variable, thus compiling; the typical naive factorial or fib implementation into efficient code.; #. TRE is performed if the function returns void, if the return returns the; result returned by the call, or if the function returns a run-time constant; on all exits from the function. It is possible, though unlikely, that the; return returns something else (like constant 0), and can still be TRE'd. It; can be TRE'd if *all other* return instructions in the function return the; exact same value.; #.

Performance,"le conditional jump instructions; that use the same flags but handle different conditions. Naively, we could; consider each fallthrough between them an ""edge"" but this causes a much more; complex control flow graph. Instead, we accumulate the set of conditions; necessary for fallthrough and use a sequence of `cmovCC` instructions in a; single fallthrough edge to track it. Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state. We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:22413,load,loads,22413,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']
Performance,"le gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++; compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is; very hard to do in a performance-portable way. In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization; paths, which drives its performance.; For example, basic inheritance sequentially lines up classes, whereas; multiple (virtual) inheritance usually requires thunks.; Thus, when calling base class methods on a derived instance, the latter; requires offset calculations that depend on that instance, whereas the former; has fixed offsets fully determined by the class definitions themselves.; By labeling classes appropriately, single inheritance classes (by far the; most common case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:2650,perform,performance-portable,2650,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['perform'],['performance-portable']

Performance,"le. But it may produce surprising results if the; debugging code depends on consistent use of ``NDEBUG`` also in other translation units. Definitions consistency; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C++ language defines that same declarations in different translation units should have; the same definition, as known as ODR (One Definition Rule). Prior to modules, the translation; units don't dependent on each other and the compiler itself can't perform a strong; ODR violation check. With the introduction of modules, now the compiler have; the chance to perform ODR violations with language semantics across translation units. However, in the practice, we found the existing ODR checking mechanism is not stable; enough. Many people suffers from the false positive ODR violation diagnostics, AKA,; the compiler are complaining two identical declarations have different definitions; incorrectly. Also the true positive ODR violations are rarely reported.; Also we learned that MSVC don't perform ODR check for declarations in the global module; fragment. So in order to get better user experience, save the time checking ODR and keep consistent; behavior with MSVC, we disabled the ODR check for the declarations in the global module; fragment by default. Users who want more strict check can still use the; ``-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf`` flag to get the ODR check enabled. It is also; encouraged to report issues if users find false positive ODR violations or false negative ODR; violations with the flag enabled. ABI Impacts; -----------. The declarations in a module unit which are not in the global module fragment have new linkage names. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. export module M;; namespace NS {; export int foo();; }. The linkage name of ``NS::foo()`` would be ``_ZN2NSW1M3fooEv``.; This couldn't be demangled by previous versions of the debugger or demangler.; As of LLVM 15.x, users can utilize ``llvm-cxxfilt`` to demangle this:. .. code-block:: console. $ llvm-cxxfilt _ZN2NSW",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:17773,perform,perform,17773,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

Improve the algorithm to compute the lower limit of an axis in log scale when its; real lower limit is 0. The problem was reported in ROOT-7414. Using the `COL` option with histograms having some negative bins; the empty bins; (containing 0) are drawn. In some cases one wants to not draw empty bins; (containing 0) of histograms having a negative minimum. The option `1`, used with; the option `COL`, allows to do that. Implement the Log option for `CANDLE` plots as requested; [here](https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20225&p=87006#p87006). ### TTeXDump. From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues for the proper line wrapping (this is the one implemented in; this change). ### TLatex.

Performance,"leased after they've been used. A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime.

Prefix data is data associated with a function which the code; generator will emit immediately before the function's entrypoint.; The purpose of this feature is to allow frontends to associate; language-specific runtime metadata with specific functions and make it; available through the function pointer while still allowing the; function pointer to be called. To access the data for a given function, a program may bitcast the; function pointer to a pointer to the constant's type and dereference; index -1. This implies that the IR symbol points just past the end of; the prefix data. For instance, take the example of a function annotated; with a single ``i32``,. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @f() prefix i32 123 { ... }. The prefix data can be referenced as,. .. code-block:: llvm. %a = getelementptr inbounds i32, ptr @f, i32 -1; %b = load i32, ptr %a. Prefix data is laid out as if it were an initializer for a global variable; of the prefix data's type. The function will be placed such that the; beginning of the prefix data is aligned. This means that if the size; of the prefix data is not a multiple of the alignment size, the; function's entrypoint will not be aligned. If alignment of the; function's entrypoint is desired, padding must be added to the prefix; data. A function may have prefix data but no body.

Being typed enables a number of; optimizations to be performed on the intermediate representation; directly, without having to do extra analyses on the side before the; transformation. A strong type system makes it easier to read the; generated code and enables novel analyses and transformations that are; not feasible to perform on normal three address code representations. .. _t_void:.

Because the; symbol is private to the module, all references can be updated. This; doesn't show up in any symbol table in the object file.; ``internal``; Similar to private, but the value shows as a local symbol; (``STB_LOCAL`` in the case of ELF) in the object file. This; corresponds to the notion of the '``static``' keyword in C.; ``available_externally``; Globals with ""``available_externally``"" linkage are never emitted into; the object file corresponding to the LLVM module. From the linker's; perspective, an ``available_externally`` global is equivalent to; an external declaration. They exist to allow inlining and other; optimizations to take place given knowledge of the definition of the; global, which is known to be somewhere outside the module.

Similar functionality is; currently provided by the CLHEP <Vector> and <Geometry> packages and the; ROOT Physics vector classes (See ""Physics Vectors""). It also re-uses; concepts and ideas from the CMS; [Common Vector package](Common Vector package). In contrast to CLHEP or; the ROOT physics libraries, `GenVector` provides class templates for; modeling the vectors. The user can control how the vector is internally; represented. This is expressed by a choice of coordinate system, which; is supplied as a template parameter when the vector is constructed.; Furthermore, each coordinate system is itself a template, so that the; user can specify the underlying scalar type. The `GenVector` classes do not inherit from **`TObject`**, therefore; cannot be used as in the case of the physics vector classes in ROOT; collections. In addition, to optimize performances, no virtual destructors are; provided. In the following paragraphs, the main characteristics of; `GenVector` are described. A more detailed description of all the; `GenVector` classes is available also at; <http://seal.cern.ch/documents/mathlib/GenVector.pdf>. ### Main Characteristics. #### Optimal Runtime Performances. We try to minimize any overhead in the run-time performance. We have; deliberately avoided the use of any virtual function and even virtual; destructors in the classes. In addition, as much as possible functions; are defined as inline. For this reason, we have chosen to use template; classes to implement the `GenVector` concepts instead of abstract or; base classes and virtual functions. It is then recommended to avoid; using the `GenVector` classes polymorphically and developing classes; inheriting from them. #### Points and Vector Concept.

On the; other hand, if a1.cpp and b1.cpp both define ""foo"" there is no error (different; dynamic libraries may define the same symbol). If main.cpp refers to ""foo"", it; should bind to the definition in LibA rather than the one in LibB, since; main.cpp is part of the ""main"" dylib, and the main dylib links against LibA; before LibB. Many JIT clients will have no need for this strict adherence to the usual; ahead-of-time linking rules, and should be able to get by just fine by putting; all of their code in a single JITDylib. However, clients who want to JIT code; for languages/projects that traditionally rely on ahead-of-time linking (e.g.; C++) will find that this feature makes life much easier. Symbol lookup in ORC serves two other important functions, beyond providing; addresses for symbols: (1) It triggers compilation of the symbol(s) searched for; (if they have not been compiled already), and (2) it provides the; synchronization mechanism for concurrent compilation. The pseudo-code for the; lookup process is:. .. code-block:: none. construct a query object from a query set and query handler; lock the session; lodge query against requested symbols, collect required materializers (if any); unlock the session; dispatch materializers (if any). In this context a materializer is something that provides a working definition; of a symbol upon request. Usually materializers are just wrappers for compilers,; but they may also wrap a jit-linker directly (if the program representation; backing the definitions is an object file), or may even be a class that writes; bits directly into memory (for example, if the definitions are; stubs).

Performance,"lete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer.

Performance,"lihood fits.; 	These classes are templated on the type of function interface they implement (see later). User convenient typedefs are also provided.; 	They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`. In addition the fitter classes make uses of the generic interfaces for parametric function evaluations, `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`; to define the fit model function and use the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface to perform the minimization of the objective function.; More information about the function interface and the multi-dimensional minimization in ROOT is given in the Mathematical Library chapter. Here we present a detailed description of the `ROOT::Fit` classes and how to use them.; Using these classes instead of the interface provided directly in the ROOT data objects, like `TH1::Fit` allow are more fine control; to configure and customise the fits. For example, using these classes a combined fit of several histograms can be performed. To understand how these class work, let's go through a simple example, such as fitting an histogram. When fitting an histogram, instead of using `TH1::Fit` we will show in the following hot wo use the `ROOT::Fit` classes.; We will show how to perform the following different type of fits with the histogram data:; * a least square fit using the observed errors (Neyman chi-squared);; * a least square fit using the expected errors from the function (Pearson chi-squared);; * a binned likelihood fit;; * an extended unbinned likelihood fits, if the histogram has been set to store in the buffer the original data used to fill it.

The LSUnit used to conservatively use an; instruction's ""MayLoad"", ""MayStore"", and unmodeled side effects flags to; determine whether an instruction should be treated as a memory-barrier. This was; inaccurate in general and was changed so that now each instruction has an; IsAStoreBarrier and IsALoadBarrier flag. These flags are mca specific and; default to false for every instruction. If any instruction should have either of; these flags set, it should be done within the target's InstrPostProcess class.; For an example, look at the `X86InstrPostProcess::postProcessInstruction` method; within `llvm/lib/Target/X86/MCA/X86CustomBehaviour.cpp`. A load/store barrier consumes one entry of the load/store queue. A load/store; barrier enforces ordering of loads/stores. A younger load cannot pass a load; barrier. Also, a younger store cannot pass a store barrier. A younger load; has to wait for the memory/load barrier to execute. A load/store barrier is; ""executed"" when it becomes the oldest entry in the load/store queue(s). That; also means, by construction, all of the older loads/stores have been executed. In conclusion, the full set of load/store consistency rules are:. #. A store may not pass a previous store.; #. A store may not pass a previous load (regardless of ``-noalias``).; #. A store has to wait until an older store barrier is fully executed.; #. A load may pass a previous load.; #. A load may not pass a previous store unless ``-noalias`` is set.; #.

Performance,"lit - LLVM Integrated Tester; ============================. .. program:: lit. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`lit` [*options*] [*tests*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See; :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a; subset of the options specified on the command line, see; :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after; parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for; supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`; by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as; inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

It's inadvisable to store raw profiles for; long periods of time. * Tools must retain **backwards** compatibility with indexed profile formats.; These formats are not forwards-compatible: i.e, a tool which uses format; version X will not be able to understand format version (X+k). * Tools must also retain **backwards** compatibility with the format of the; coverage mappings emitted into instrumented binaries. These formats are not; forwards-compatible. * The JSON coverage export format has a (major, minor, patch) version triple.; Only a major version increment indicates a backwards-incompatible change. A; minor version increment is for added functionality, and patch version; increments are for bugfixes. Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports; ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no; impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables.

When MCJIT::finalizeObject is called, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations. This function will attempt to locate any; external symbols and then apply all relocations for the object. External symbols are resolved by calling the memory manager's; getPointerToNamedFunction method. The memory manager will return the; address of the requested symbol in the target address space. (Note, this; may not be a valid pointer in the host process.) RuntimeDyld will then; iterate through the list of relocations it has stored which are associated; with this symbol and invoke the resolveRelocation method which, through an; format-specific implementation, will apply the relocation to the loaded; section memory. Next, RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations iterates through the list of; sections and for each section iterates through a list of relocations that; have been saved which reference that symbol and call resolveRelocation for; each entry in this list. The relocation list here is a list of; relocations for which the symbol associated with the relocation is located; in the section associated with the list. Each of these locations will; have a target location at which the relocation will be applied that is; likely located in a different section. .. image:: MCJIT-resolve-relocations.png. Once relocations have been applied as described above, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::getEHFrameSection, and if a non-zero result is returned; passes the section data to the memory manager's registerEHFrames method.; This allows the memory manager to call any desired target-specific; functions, such as registering the EH frame information with a debugger. Finally, MCJIT calls the memory manager's finalizeMemory method. In this; method, the memory manager will invalidate the target code cache, if; necessary, and apply final permissions to the memory pages it has; allocated for code and data memory.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:8607,cache,cache,8607,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this RO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23398,load,loaded,23398,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['load'],['loaded']

Once you have executed `GetEntry`, the leaf data members; in `MyClass` are set to the values of the entry. For example,; `GetEntry(12)` loads the 13th event into the event data member of; `MyClass` (note that the first entry is 0). `GetEntry` returns the; number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read; twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case `GetEntry`; returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return; of 0 means an error has occurred while reading. - `Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry)` and `void Notify()` - these two; methods are related to chains. `LoadTree` will load the tree; containing the specified entry from a chain of trees. Notify is; called by `LoadTree` to adjust the branch addresses. - `void Loop()` - it is the skeleton method that loops through each; entry of the tree. This is interesting to us, because we will need; to customize it for our analysis. ### MyClass.C. `MyClass::Loop` consists of a for-loop calling `GetEntry` for each; entry.

So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

A **`TEventList`** or a **`TEntryList`** can be used to limit the; **`TTree`** to the events in the list. The methods `SetEventList` and; `SetEntryList` tell the tree to use the list and hence limit all; subsequent calls to `Draw`, `Scan`, `Process`, `Query`, `Principal` and; `CopyTree` methods to the entries in the list. In general, it affects; the `GetEntryNumber` method and all functions using it for looping over; the tree entries. The `GetEntry` and `GetEntries` methods are not; affected. Note, that in the `SetEventList` method, the **`TEventList`**; argument is internally transformed into a **`TEntryList`**, and this; operation, in case of a **`TChain`**, requires loading of all the tree; headers. In this example, we create a list with all entries with more; than 600 tracks and then set it so that the tree will use this list. To; reset the **`TTree`** to use all events use `SetEventList(0)` or; `SetEntryList(0)`. 1. Let's look at an example. First, open the file and draw the; `fNtrack`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] TTree *T = (TTree*)f->Get(""T"");; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack"");; ```. 2. Now, put the entries with over 600 tracks into a **`TEntryList`**; called `myList`. We get the list from the current directory and assign; it to a variable list. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw("">>myList"",""fNtrack > 600"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list=(TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""myList"");; ```. 3. Instruct the tree **`T`** to use the new list and draw it again. Note; that this is exactly the same `Draw` command. The list limits the; entries. ``` {.cpp}; ro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:111240,load,loading,111240,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['load'],['loading']

This funny looking code creates an IRBuilder object that is pointing at; the first instruction (.begin()) of the entry block. It then creates an; alloca with the expected name and returns it. Because all values in; Kaleidoscope are doubles, there is no need to pass in a type to use. With this in place, the first functionality change we want to make belongs to; variable references.

Note that this definition of *""based""* is intentionally similar to the; definition of *""based""* in C99, though it is slightly weaker. LLVM IR does not associate types with memory. The result type of a; ``load`` merely indicates the size and alignment of the memory from; which to load, as well as the interpretation of the value. The first; operand type of a ``store`` similarly only indicates the size and; alignment of the store. Consequently, type-based alias analysis, aka TBAA, aka; ``-fstrict-aliasing``, is not applicable to general unadorned LLVM IR.; :ref:`Metadata <metadata>` may be used to encode additional information; which specialized optimization passes may use to implement type-based; alias analysis. .. _pointercapture:.

There; are currently two Primary allocators implemented, specific to 32 and 64 bit; architectures. It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of caches. - the Quarantine: offers a way to delay the deallocation operations, preventing; blocks to be immediately available for reuse. Blocks held will be recycled; once certain size criteria are reached. This is essentially a delayed freelist; which can help mitigate some use-after-free situations.

The Root node is; the final side-effecting node in the token chain. For example, in a single basic; block function it would be the return node. One important concept for SelectionDAGs is the notion of a ""legal"" vs.; ""illegal"" DAG. A legal DAG for a target is one that only uses supported; operations and supported types. On a 32-bit PowerPC, for example, a DAG with a; value of type i1, i8, i16, or i64 would be illegal, as would a DAG that uses a; SREM or UREM operation.

The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream.

When an opt-bisect index value refers to an entire invocation of the run; function for a pass, the pass will query whether or not it should be skipped; each time it is invoked and each invocation will be assigned a unique value.; For example, if a FunctionPass is used with a module containing three functions; a different index value will b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst:3620,optimiz,optimization,3620,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'performed']"

Most importantly, this means that arithmetic operations; on operands of these types are formally performed in the type and produce; values of the type. ``__fp16`` does not follow those rules: most operations; immediately promote operands of type ``__fp16`` to ``float``, and so; arithmetic operations are defined to be performed in ``float`` and so result in; a value of type ``float`` (unless further promoted because of other operands).; See below for more information on the exact specifications of these types.

Retained return values; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A function or method which returns a retainable object pointer type may be; marked as returning a retained value, signifying that the caller expects to take; ownership of a +1 retain count. This is done by adding the; ``ns_returns_retained`` attribute to the function or method declaration, like; so:. .. code-block:: objc. id foo(void) __attribute((ns_returns_retained));; - (id) foo __attribute((ns_returns_retained));. This attribute is part of the type of the function or method. When returning from such a function or method, ARC retains the value at the; point of evaluation of the return statement, before leaving all local scopes. When receiving a return result from such a function or method, ARC releases the; value at the end of the full-expression it is contained within, subject to the; usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a callee to a caller. The; most common scenario this models is the retained return from ``init``,; ``alloc``, ``new``, and ``copy`` methods, but there are other cases in the; frameworks.

Performance,"llvm-diff - LLVM structural 'diff'; ==================================. .. program:: llvm-diff. SYNOPSIS; --------. **llvm-diff** [*options*] *module 1* *module 2* [*global name ...*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. **llvm-diff** compares the structure of two LLVM modules, primarily; focusing on differences in function definitions. Insignificant; differences, such as changes in the ordering of globals or in the; names of local values, are ignored. An input module will be interpreted as an assembly file if its name; ends in '.ll'; otherwise it will be read in as a bitcode file. If a list of global names is given, just the values with those names; are compared; otherwise, all global values are compared, and; diagnostics are produced for globals which only appear in one module; or the other. **llvm-diff** compares two functions by comparing their basic blocks,; beginning with the entry blocks. If the terminators seem to match,; then the corresponding successors are compared; otherwise they are; ignored. This algorithm is very sensitive to changes in control flow,; which tend to stop any downstream changes from being detected. **llvm-diff** is intended as a debugging tool for writers of LLVM; passes and frontends. It does not have a stable output format. EXIT STATUS; -----------. If **llvm-diff** finds no differences between the modules, it will exit; with 0 and produce no output. Otherwise it will exit with a non-zero; value. BUGS; ----. Many important differences, like changes in linkage or function; attributes, are not diagnosed.

Performance,"llvm-exegesis - LLVM Machine Instruction Benchmark; ==================================================. .. program:: llvm-exegesis. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` [*options*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` is a benchmarking tool that uses information available; in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like latency,; throughput, or port decomposition. Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:362,latency,latency,362,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,5,"['latency', 'perform', 'throughput']","['latency', 'performance', 'throughput']"
Performance,"llvm-mca - LLVM Machine Code Analyzer; =====================================. .. program:: llvm-mca. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-mca` [*options*] [input]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-mca` is a performance analysis tool that uses information; available in LLVM (e.g. scheduling models) to statically measure the performance; of machine code in a specific CPU. Performance is measured in terms of throughput as well as processor resource; consumption. The tool currently works for processors with a backend for which; there is a scheduling model available in LLVM. The main goal of this tool is not just to predict the performance of the code; when run on the target, but also help with diagnosing potential performance; issues. Given an assembly code sequence, :program:`llvm-mca` estimates the Instructions; Per Cycle (IPC), as well as hardware resource pressure. The analysis and; reporting style were inspired by the IACA tool from Intel. For example, you can compile code with clang, output assembly, and pipe it; directly into :program:`llvm-mca` for analysis:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. Or for Intel syntax:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -masm=intel -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. (:program:`llvm-mca` detects Intel syntax by the presence of an `.intel_syntax`; directive at the beginning of the input. By default its output syntax matches; that of its input.). Scheduling models are not just used to compute instruction latencies and; throughput, but also to understand what processor resources are available; and how to simulate them. By design, the quality of the analysis conducted by :program:`llvm-mca` is; inevitably affected by the quality of the scheduling models in LLVM. If you see that the performance report is not accurate for a processor,; please `file a bug <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_; against the appropriate backend. OPTIONS; -------.

Performance,"lly allocated when the hardware creates work-groups of wavefronts, and; freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`).

Performance,"lly dispatched call sent to this; receiver because the function definition is considered to be fully resolved. * ``DynamicDispatchModeConservative`` - Models the case where the dynamic type; information is assumed to be incorrect, for example, implies that the method; definition is overridden in a subclass. In such cases, ExprEngine does not; inline the methods sent to the receiver (MemoryRegion), even if a candidate; definition is available. This mode is conservative about simulating the; effects of a call. Going forward along the symbolic execution path, ExprEngine consults the mode; of the receiver's MemRegion to make decisions on whether the calls should be; inlined or not, which ensures that there is at most one split per region. At a high level, ""bifurcation mode"" allows for increased semantic coverage in; cases where the parent method contains code which is only executed when the; class is subclassed. The disadvantages of this mode are a (considerable?); performance hit and the possibility of false positives on the path where the; conservative mode is used.

Performance,"lly; very efficient and do not incur a large runtime overhead. The; sample data collected by the profiler can be used during compilation; to determine what the most executed areas of the code are. Using the data from a sample profiler requires some changes in the way; a program is built. Before the compiler can use profiling information,; the code needs to execute under the profiler. The following is the; usual build cycle when using sample profilers for optimization:. 1. Build the code with source line table information. You can use all the; usual build flags that you always build your application with. The only; requirement is that you add ``-gline-tables-only`` or ``-g`` to the; command line. This is important for the profiler to be able to map; instructions back to source line locations. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -gline-tables-only code.cc -o code. 2. Run the executable under a sampling profiler. The specific profiler; you use does not really matter, as long as its output can be converted; into the format that the LLVM optimizer understands. Currently, there; exists a conversion tool for the Linux Perf profiler; (https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/), so these examples assume that you; are using Linux Perf to profile your code. .. code-block:: console. $ perf record -b ./code. Note the use of the ``-b`` flag. This tells Perf to use the Last Branch; Record (LBR) to record call chains. While this is not strictly required,; it provides better call information, which improves the accuracy of; the profile data. 3. Convert the collected profile data to LLVM's sample profile format.; This is currently supported via the AutoFDO converter ``create_llvm_prof``.; It is available at https://github.com/google/autofdo. Once built and; installed, you can convert the ``perf.data`` file to LLVM using; the command:. .. code-block:: console. $ create_llvm_prof --binary=./code --out=code.prof.

Given; SSA is the canonical form expected by much of the optimizer; if allocas can; not be eliminated by Mem2Reg or SROA, the optimizer is likely to be less; effective than it could be. Avoid loads and stores of large aggregate type; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM currently does not optimize well loads and stores of large :ref:`aggregate; types <t_aggregate>` (i.e. structs and arrays). As an alternative, consider; loading individual fields from memory. Aggregates that are smaller than the largest (performant) load or store; instruction supported by the targeted hardware are well supported. These can; be an effective way to represent collections of small packed fields. Prefer zext over sext when legal; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. On some architectures (X86_64 is one), sign extension can involve an extra; instruction whereas zero extension can be folded into a load. LLVM will try to; replace a sext with a zext when it can be proven safe, but if you have; information in your source language about the range of an integer value, it can; be profitable to use a zext rather than a sext. Alternatively, you can :ref:`specify the range of the value using metadata; <range-metadata>` and LLVM can do the sext to zext conversion for you. Zext GEP indices to machine register width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Internally, LLVM often promotes the width of GEP indices to machine register; width. When it does so, it will default to using sign extension (sext); operations for safety. If your source language provides information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction.

While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate.

These intrinsics are used to provide special handling of floating-point; operations when specific rounding mode or floating-point exception behavior is; required. By default, LLVM optimization passes assume that the rounding mode is; round-to-nearest and that floating-point exceptions will not be monitored.; Constrained FP intrinsics are used to support non-default rounding modes and; accurately preserve exception behavior without compromising LLVM's ability to; optimize FP code when the default behavior is used. If any FP operation in a function is constrained then they all must be; constrained. This is required for correct LLVM IR. Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::.

AMDGPU supports programming languages that include online compilation where the; source text may be created at runtime. For example, the OpenCL and HIP language; runtimes support online compilation. To support is, a way to embed the source; text in the debug information is provided.

In DWARF Version 5 the file timestamp and file size can be optional, but if the; MD5 checksum is present it must be valid for all files. This is a problem if; using link time optimization to combine compilation units where some have MD5; checksums and some do not.

Performance,"lookup is no longer handled by layers. Instead, there is a; ``lookup`` method on JITDylib that takes a list of JITDylibs to scan. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; JITDylib &JD1 = ...;; JITDylib &JD2 = ...;. auto Sym = ES.lookup({&JD1, &JD2}, ES.intern(""_main""));. 6.

For code examples and suggestions of how to use the ORCv2 APIs, please see; the section `How-tos`_. How-tos; =======. How to manage symbol strings; ----------------------------. Symbol strings in ORC are uniqued to improve lookup performance, reduce memory; overhead, and allow symbol names to function as efficient keys. To get the; unique ``SymbolStringPtr`` for a string value, call the; ``ExecutionSession::intern`` method:. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; /// ...; auto MainSymbolName = ES.intern(""main"");. If you wish to perform lookup using the C/IR name of a symbol you will also; need to apply the platform linker-mangling before interning the string. On; Linux this mangling is a no-op, but on other platforms it usually involves; adding a prefix to the string (e.g. '_' on Darwin). The mangling scheme is; based on the DataLayout for the target. Given a DataLayout and an; ExecutionSession, you can create a MangleAndInterner function object that; will perform both jobs for you:. .. code-block:: c++.

Performance,"lp build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time.

Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken.

At each callsite, a ""liveout"" register list is also recorded. These; are the registers that are live across the stackmap and therefore must; be saved by the runtime. This is an important optimization when the; patchpoint intrinsic is used with a calling convention that by default; preserves most registers as callee-save. Each entry in the liveout register list contains a DWARF register; number and size in bytes. The stackmap format deliberately omits; specific subregister information. Instead the runtime must interpret; this information conservatively. For example, if the stackmap reports; one byte at ``%rax``, then the value may be in either ``%al`` or; ``%ah``. It doesn't matter in practice, because the runtime will; simply save ``%rax``. However, if the stackmap reports 16 bytes at; ``%ymm0``, then the runtime can safely optimize by saving only; ``%xmm0``. The stack map format is a contract between an LLVM SVN revision and; the runtime. It is currently experimental and may change in the short; term, but minimizing the need to update the runtime is; important. Consequently, the stack map design is motivated by; simplicity and extensibility. Compactness of the representation is; secondary because the runtime is expected to parse the data; immediately after compiling a module and encode the information in its; own format. Since the runtime controls the allocation of sections, it; can reuse the same stack map space for multiple modules. Stackmap support is currently only implemented for 64-bit; platforms.

This requires two transformations: reassociation of; expressions (to make the add's lexically identical) and Common; Subexpression Elimination (CSE) to delete the redundant add instruction.; Fortunately, LLVM provides a broad range of optimizations that you can; use, in the form of ""passes"". LLVM Optimization Passes; ========================. LLVM provides many optimization passes, which do many different sorts of; things and have different tradeoffs. Unlike other systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in.

Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary. In order to build your fuzzer binary, use the `-fsanitize=fuzzer` flag during the; compilation and linking. In most cases you may want to combine libFuzzer with; AddressSanitizer_ (ASAN), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer_ (UBSAN), or both. You can; also build with MemorySanitizer_ (MSAN), but support is experimental::. clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target w/o sanitizers; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with ASAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,signed-integer-overflow mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with a part of UBSAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,memory mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with MSAN. This will perform the necessary instrumentation, as well as linking with the libFuzzer library.; Note that ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` links in the libFuzzer's ``main()`` symbol. If modifying ``CFLAGS`` of a large project, which also compiles executables; requiring their own ``main`` symbol, it may be desirable to request just the; instrumentation without linking::. clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c. Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in; ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` during the linking stage. .. _libfuzzer-corpus:. Corpus; ------. Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files.

To determine whether a statement reads or writes a field we can implement; symbolic evaluation of `DeclRefExpr`s, `LValueToRValue` casts, pointer; dereference operator and `MemberExpr`s. ### Using data flow results to identify output parameters. Let's take a look at how we use data flow analysis to identify an output; parameter. The refactoring can be safely done when the data flow algorithm; computes a normal state with all of the fields proven to be overwritten in the; exit basic block of the function. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; };. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; } else {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; ```. When the data flow algorithm computes a normal state, but not all fields are; proven to be overwritten we can't perform the refactoring. ```c++; void target(bool b, Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; if (b) {; c->account_id = 42; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; } else {; c->name = ""Konrad""; // Overwritten: {c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {}; }; ```. Similarly, when the data flow algorithm computes a failure state, we also can't; perform the refactoring. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; print(c->name); // Unsafe read; } else {; kGlobalCustomer = c; // Pointer escape; }; // Unsafe read, Pointer escape; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead stores. Let's say we want to find redundant stores, because they indicate potential; bugs. ```c++; x = GetX();; x = GetY();; ```. The first store to `x` is never read, probably there is a bug.

The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3. Space is allocated for the kernel arguments using the HSA compatible runtime; allocator for a memory region with the kernarg property for the kernel agent; that will execute the kernel. It must be at least 16-byte aligned.; 4. Kernel argument values are assigned to the kernel argument memory; allocation. The layout is defined in the *HSA Programmer's Language; Reference* [HSA]_. For AMDGPU the kernel execution directly accesses the; kernel argument memory in the same way constant memory is accessed. (Note; that the HSA specification allows an implementation to copy the kernel; argument contents to another location that is accessed by the kernel.); 5.

Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If you; have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic up on; the llvm-dev list.

Performance,"machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid; needing to invalidate the L2 cache.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed; by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to; invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches.

Here precision represents the desired maximum accepted overlap value in; centimeters (default value is 0.1). This tool checks all possible; significant pairs of candidates inside a given volume (not declared as; overlapping or division volumes).

For a 100% reliability, one can perform the; check at the level of a single volume by using `option`=""`d`"" or; `option`=""`d<number>`"" to perform overlap checking by sampling the; volume with \<`number`\> random points (default 1 million).

Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:.

Performance,"mand in the canvas File menu pops-up a print dialog where; the user can specify a preferred print command and the printer name. ![](pictures/0300002D.png). Both print parameters can be set via the new Print.Command and; Print.Printer rootrc resources as follows:. ```; # Printer settings.; WinNT.*.Print.Command: AcroRd32.exe; Unix.*.Print.Command: xprint -P%p %f; Print.Printer: 32-rb205-hp; Print.Directory: .; ```. If the `%p` and `%f` are specified as a part of the print command,; they will be replaced by the specified printer name and the file name.; All other parameters will be kept as they are written. A print button; is available in the canvas toolbar (activated via View menu/Toolbar). ## The ROOT Command Line. We have briefly touched on how to use the command line. There are; different types of commands. 1. Cling commands start with ""`.`"". ``` {.cpp}; root[] .? //this command will list all the Cling commands; root[] .L <filename> //load [filename]; root[] .x <filename> //load and execute [filename]; ```. 2. SHELL commands start with ""`.!`"" for example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .! ls; ```. 3. C++ commands follow C++ syntax (almost). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser(); ```. ### Multi-line Commands. You can use the command line to execute multi-line commands. To begin; a multi-line command you must type a single left curly bracket `{`,; and to end it you must type a single right curly bracket `}`.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] {; end with '}'> Int_t j = 0;; end with '}'> for (Int_t i = 0; i < 3; i++); end with '}'> {; end with '}'> j= j + i;; end with '}'> cout << ""i = "" << i << "", j = "" << j << endl;; end with '}'> }; end with '}'> }; i = 0, j = 0; i = 1, j = 1; i = 2, j = 3; ```. It is more convenient to edit a script than the command line, and if; your multi line commands are getting unmanageable, you may want to; start with a script instead. ### Cling Extensions.

Overflow cannot occur in; ``(%base + i)`` and its comparison against ``%n`` as it is performed in integer; numbers and not in machine numbers. If ``%n`` is ``0``, then the result is a; poison value. The above is equivalent to:. ::. %m = @llvm.get.active.lane.mask(%base, %n). This can, for example, be emitted by the loop vectorizer in which case; ``%base`` is the first element of the vector induction variable (VIV) and; ``%n`` is the loop tripcount. Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow.

Force floating-point operations to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode by default. The result of a floating-point operation often cannot be exactly represented in the result type and therefore must be rounded. IEEE 754 describes different rounding modes that control how to perform this rounding, not all of which are supported by all implementations. C provides interfaces (``fesetround`` and ``fesetenv``) for dynamically controlling the rounding mode, and while it also recommends certain conventions for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables. Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode. This prevents optimizations which might affect results if the rounding mode changes or is different from the default; for example, it prevents floating-point operations from being reordered across most calls and prevents constant-folding when the result is not exactly representable. .. option:: -ffp-model=<value>.

Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very; practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible; overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating; honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using; assemblies can be found at:; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/assembly.C.html>`.`.

Note that components cannot be declared as ""overlapping"" and that a; component can be an assembly volume. For existing flat volume; structures, one can define assemblies to force a hierarchical structure; therefore optimizing the performance. Usage of assemblies does NOT imply; penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape.

Performance,"mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap.

The API to; use is ``Instruction::applyMergedLocation``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that a) the single merged instruction; has a location with an accurate scope attached, and b) to prevent misleading; single-stepping (or breakpoint) behavior. Often, merged instructions are memory; accesses which can trap: having an accurate scope attached greatly assists in; crash triage by identifying the (possibly inlined) function where the bad; memory access occurred. This rule is also meant to assist SamplePGO by banning; scenarios in which a sample of a block containing a merged instruction is; misattributed to a block containing one of the instructions-to-be-merged. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Merging identical loads/stores which occur on both sides of a CFG diamond; (see the ``MergedLoadStoreMotion`` pass). * Merging identical loop-invariant stores (see the LICM utility; ``llvm::promoteLoopAccessesToScalars``). * Peephole optimizations which combine multiple instructions together, like; ``(add (mul A B) C) => llvm.fma.f32(A, B, C)``.

HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic).

Performance,"mine the location of values at a specific position in; the code. LLVM does not maintain any mapping between those values and; any higher-level entity. The runtime must be able to interpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:17972,load,loads,17972,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

Performance,"mm4. According to this report, the dot-product kernel has been executed 300 times,; for a total of 900 simulated instructions. The total number of simulated micro; opcodes (uOps) is also 900. The report is structured in three main sections. The first section collects a; few performance numbers; the goal of this section is to give a very quick; overview of the performance throughput. Important performance indicators are; **IPC**, **uOps Per Cycle**, and **Block RThroughput** (Block Reciprocal; Throughput). Field *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes that are dispatched; to the out-of-order backend every simulated cycle. For processors with an; in-order backend, *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes issued; to the backend every simulated cycle. IPC is computed dividing the total number of simulated instructions by the total; number of cycles. Field *Block RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the block throughput. Block; throughput is a theoretical quantity computed as the maximum number of blocks; (i.e. iterations) that can be executed per simulated clock cycle in the absence; of loop carried dependencies. Block throughput is superiorly limited by the; dispatch rate, and the availability of hardware resources. In the absence of loop-carried data dependencies, the observed IPC tends to a; theoretical maximum which can be computed by dividing the number of instructions; of a single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field 'uOps Per Cycle' is computed dividing the total number of simulated micro; opcodes by the total number of cycles. A delta between Dispatch Width and this; field is an indicator of a performance issue.

This is safe because all of the output bits are affected by the undef; bits.

These logical operations have bits that are not always affected by the; input. For example, if ``%X`` has a zero bit, then the output of the; '``and``' operation will always be a zero for that bit, no matter what; the corresponding bit from the '``undef``' is. As such, it is unsafe to; optimize or assume that the result of the '``and``' is '``undef``'.; However, it is safe to assume that all bits of the '``undef``' could be; 0, and optimize the '``and``' to 0. Likewise, it is safe to assume that; all the bits of the '``undef``' operand to the '``or``' could be set,; allowing the '``or``' to be folded to -1. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = select undef, %X, %Y; %B = select undef, 42, %Y; %C = select %X, %Y, undef; Safe:; %A = %X (or %Y); %B = 42 (or %Y); %C = %Y (if %Y is provably not poison; unsafe otherwise); Unsafe:; %A = undef; %B = undef; %C = undef. This set of examples shows that undefined '``select``' (and conditional; branch) conditions can go *either way*, but they have to come from one; of the two operands.

This allows LLVM to provide a; powerful intermediate representation for efficient compiler; transformations and analysis, while providing a natural means to debug; and visualize the transformations. The three different forms of LLVM are; all equivalent. This document describes the human readable; representation and notation. The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while; being expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be; a ""universal IR"" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that; high-level ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how; microprocessors are ""universal IR's"", allowing many source languages to; be mapped to them). By providing type information, LLVM can be used as; the target of optimizations: for example, through pointer analysis, it; can be proven that a C automatic variable is never accessed outside of; the current function, allowing it to be promoted to a simple SSA value; instead of a memory location. .. _wellformed:.

There is a difference between what the parser accepts; and what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following; instruction is syntactically okay, but not well formed:. .. code-block:: llvm. %x = add i32 1, %x. because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The; LLVM infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to; verify that an LLVM module is well formed.

Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm.

Performance,"mpiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*.

In C99, inline means that a function's definition is; provided only for inlining, and that there is another definition; (without inline) somewhere else in the program.

For a 100% reliability, one can perform the; check at the level of a single volume by using `option`=""`d`"" or; `option`=""`d<number>`"" to perform overlap checking by sampling the; volume with \<`number`\> random points (default 1 million). This; produces also a picture showing in red the overlapping region and; estimates the volume of the overlaps. An extrusion A) is declared in any of the following cases:. - At least one of the vertices of the daughter mesh representation is; outside the mother volume (in fact its shape) and having a safety; distance to the mother greater than the desired value;; - At least one of the mother vertices is contained also by one of its; daughters, in the same conditions. An overlap B) is declared if:. - At least one vertex of a positioned volume mesh is contained (having; a safety bigger than the accepted maximum value) by other positioned; volume inside the same container. The check is performed also by; inverting the candidates. The code is highly optimized to avoid checking candidates that are far; away in space by performing a fast check on their bounding boxes.

SequentiallyConsistent stores; generate an ``XCHG``, other stores generate a ``MOV``. SequentiallyConsistent; fences generate an ``MFENCE``, other fences do not cause any code to be; generated. ``cmpxchg`` uses the ``LOCK CMPXCHG`` instruction. ``atomicrmw xchg``; uses ``XCHG``, ``atomicrmw add`` and ``atomicrmw sub`` use ``XADD``, and all; other ``atomicrmw`` operations generate a loop with ``LOCK CMPXCHG``. Depending; on the users of the result, some ``atomicrmw`` operations can be translated into; operations like ``LOCK AND``, but that does not work in general. On ARM (before v8), MIPS, and many other RISC architectures, Acquire, Release,; and SequentiallyConsistent semantics require barrier instructions for every such; operation. Loads and stores generate normal instructions. ``cmpxchg`` and; ``atomicrmw`` can be represented using a loop with LL/SC-style instructions; which take some sort of exclusive lock on a cache line (``LDREX`` and ``STREX``; on ARM, etc.).

Performance,"must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```.

This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above.

While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow.

Note: A current limitation means that when an external viewer is created; the pad is no longer redrawn. When the external viewer is closed,; clicking in the pad will refresh. ### The GL Viewer. The GL Viewer uses <OpenGL®> (or compliant libraries such as <Mesa3D>); to generate high quality, high-performance 3D renderings, with; sophisticated lighting, materials and rendering styles for 3D scenes.; Many users will be able to take advantage of hardware acceleration of; the underlying OpenGL commands by their computer's video card, resulting; is considerable performance gains - up to interactive manipulation of; 1000's of complex shapes in real-time. The GL Viewer is supported on all official ROOT platforms (assuming you; have suitable <OpenGL®> libraries), and is the main 3D viewer, which; development effort is concentrated upon. As OpenGL® is a trademark we; refer to our viewer built on this technology as the ‘GL Viewer'. The; code for it can be found under `$ROOTSYS/gl`. ![The GL 3D Viewer](pictures/020000DA.jpg). You can manipulate the viewer via the GUI or via the base; **`TGLViewer`** object behind the interface. These are detailed below -; see also `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/gl/glViewerExercise.C`. #### Projections Modes (Cameras). The GL Viewer supports two basic types of camera, which affect how the; 3D world is projected onto the 2D render area:. - Perspective: Objects are drawn with characteristic ‘foreshortening'; effect, where distant objects appear smaller than near ones.

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]].

If different cleanup code needs to get executed for different suspend points,; a similar switch will be in the `f.destroy` function. .. note ::. Using suspend index in a coroutine state and having a switch in `f.resume` and; `f.destroy` is one of the possible implementation strategies. We explored; another option where a distinct `f.resume1`, `f.resume2`, etc. are created for; every suspend point, and instead of storing an index, the resume and destroy; function pointers are updated at every suspend. Early testing showed that the; current approach is easier on the optimizer than the latter so it is a; lowering strategy implemented at the moment. Distinct Save and Suspend; -------------------------. In the previous example, setting a resume index (or some other state change that; needs to happen to prepare a coroutine for resumption) happens at the same time as; a suspension of a coroutine. However, in certain cases, it is necessary to control; when coroutine is prepared for resumption and when it is suspended. In the following example, a coroutine represents some activity that is driven; by completions of asynchronous operations `async_op1` and `async_op2` which get; a coroutine handle as a parameter and resume the coroutine once async; operation is finished. .. code-block:: text. void g() {; for (;;); if (cond()) {; async_op1(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op1 completes; <suspend>; do_one();; }; else {; async_op2(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op2 completes; <suspend>; do_two();; }; }; }.

Performance,"n bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------. You can compute an address that way, but if you use GEP to do the add, you can't; use that pointer to actually access the object, unless the object is managed; outside of LLVM. The underlying integer computation is sufficiently defined; null has a defined; value --- zero --- and you can add whatever value you want to it. However, it's invalid to access (load from or store to) an LLVM-aware object; with such a pointer. This includes ``GlobalVariables``, ``Allocas``, and objects; pointed to by noalias pointers. If you really need this functionality, you can do the arithmetic with explicit; integer instructions, and use inttoptr to convert the result to an address. Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences. Can I compute the distance between two objects, and add that value to one address to compute the other address?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. As with arithmetic on null, you can use GEP to compute an address that way, but; you can't use that pointer to actually access the object if you do, unless the; object is managed outside of LLVM.

It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions.

Performance,"n may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation. As an exception to the preceding rule, the compiler may not assume execution; will continue after a volatile store operation. This restriction is necessary; to support the somewhat common pattern in C of intentionally storing to an; invalid pointer to crash the program. In the future, it might make sense to; allow frontends to control this behavior. IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into llvm.memcpy; or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are flagged volatile.; Likewise, the backend should never split or merge target-legal volatile; load/store instructions. Similarly, IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot; change from integer to floating-point or vice versa. .. admonition:: Rationale. Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported; data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C; this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native; hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types. The; frontend upholds these expectations, which are intentionally; unspecified in the IR. The rules above ensure that IR transformations; do not violate the frontend's contract with the language. .. _memmodel:.

Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as the unaligned store.

Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class. A general homogenous transformation is defined as a 4x4 matrix embedding; a rotation, a translation and a scale. The advantage of this description; is that each basic transformation can be represented as a homogenous; matrix, composition being performed as simple matrix multiplication. Rotation:. \f[; \left|\begin{array}{cccc}; r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & 0 \\; r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & 0 \\; r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & 0 \\; 0 & 0 & 0 & 1; \end{array}; \right|; \f].

One attempt to address the performance overhead of this and make it more; realistic to deploy is [MSVC's /Qspectre; switch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/).; Their technique is to use static analysis within the compiler to only insert; `lfence` instructions into conditional edges at risk of attack. However,; [initial](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/microsofts-compiler-level-spectre-fix-shows-how-hard-this-problem-will-be-to-solve/); [analysis](https://www.paulkocher.com/doc/MicrosoftCompilerSpectreMitigation.html); has shown that this approach is incomplete and only catches a small and limited; subset of attackable patterns which happen to resemble very closely the initial; proofs of concept. As such, while its performance is acceptable, it does not; appear to be an adequate systematic mitigation. ## Performance Overhead. The performance overhead of this style of comprehensive mitigation is very; high. However, it compares very favorably with previously recommended; approaches such as the `lfence` instruction. Just as users can restrict the; scope of `lfence` to control its performance impact, this mitigation technique; could be restricted in scope as well. However, it is important to understand what it would cost to get a fully; mitigated baseline.

We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers.

The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheata@cern.ch>. ## Database Libraries. * Fix `TPgSQLStatement::SetBinary` to actually handle binary data (previous limited to ascii). ## Networking Libraries. * When seeing too many requested range",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23703,load,loading,23703,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['load'],['loading']

One can activate or deactivate clipping at any time:; `gGeoManager->SetClipping(flag);`. 3. Perform ray-tracing:` gGeoManager->GetTopVolume()->Raytrace();`. One can redo the steps 2-3 as many times as needed. Let us look how the; ***`rootgeom`*** example looks clipped with a tube. ![Ray-tracing example with box-clipping](pictures/030001E5.png). ## Representing Misalignments of the Ideal Geometry. The ideal positioning of a detector does not match its position in the; experimental hall. This generally happens not only for the detector; modules, but also for their components. The accurate knowledge of the; detector real misalignments can be extremely important for getting close; to its designed resolution and the expected tracking efficiency.; **`TGeo`** offers tools for representing positioning misalignments,; applying them to the ideal geometry and performing navigation under; these conditions. Detector tracking algorithms can then directly query; the geometry for navigation purposes or for retrieving actual; misalignment information. ### Physical Nodes. Physical nodes are the actual ""touchable"" objects in the geometry,; representing actually a path of positioned volumes starting with the; top node: `path=/TOP/A_1/B_4/C_3` , where `A`, `B`, `C` represent names; of volumes. The number of physical nodes is given by the total number of; possible of branches in the geometry hierarchy. In case of detector; geometries and specially for calorimeters this number can be of the; order 106-109, therefore it is impossible to create all physical nodes; as objects in memory. In **`TGeo`**, physical nodes are represented by; the class **`TGeoPhysicalNode`** and can be created on demand for; alignment purposes:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoPhysicalNode(const char* path); ```.

If Addr is the target address, and V is the shadow value, then; the address of __cfi_check is calculated as. .. code-block:: none. __cfi_check = AlignUpTo(Addr, 4096) - (V + 1) * 4096. This works as long as __cfi_check is aligned by 4096 bytes and located; below any call targets in its DSO, but not more than 256MB apart from; them. CFI_SlowPath; ------------. The slow path check is implemented in a runtime support library as. .. code-block:: none. void __cfi_slowpath(uint64 CallSiteTypeId, void *TargetAddr); void __cfi_slowpath_diag(uint64 CallSiteTypeId, void *TargetAddr, void *DiagData). These functions loads a shadow value for ``TargetAddr``, finds the; address of ``__cfi_check`` as described above and calls; that. ``DiagData`` is an opaque pointer to diagnostic data which is; passed verbatim to ``__cfi_check``, and ``__cfi_slowpath`` passes; ``nullptr`` instead. Compiler-RT library contains reference implementations of slowpath; functions, but they have unresolvable issues with correctness and; performance in the handling of dlopen(). It is recommended that; platforms provide their own implementations, usually as part of libc; or libdl. Position-independent executable requirement; -------------------------------------------.

These; are generally non-intended overlaps due to coding mistakes or bad; geometry design. The checking package is loaded together with the; painter classes and contains an automated overlap checker. \image html geometry008.png ""Overlap checking"". This can be activated both at volume level (checking for illegal; overlaps only one level inside a given volume) and from the geometry; manager level (checking full geometry):. ~~~{.cpp}; myVolume->CheckOverlaps(precision, option);; gGeoManager->CheckOverlaps(precision);; myNode->CheckOverlaps(precision);; ~~~. Here precision represents the desired maximum accepted overlap value in; centimeters (default value is 0.1). This tool checks all possible; significant pairs of candidates inside a given volume (not declared as; overlapping or division volumes). The check is performed by verifying; the mesh representation of one candidate against the shape of the other.; This sort of check cannot identify all possible overlapping topologies,; but it works for more than 95% and is much faster than the usual; shape-to-shape comparison. For a 100% reliability, one can perform the; check at the level of a single volume by using `option`=""`d`"" or; `option`=""`d<number>`"" to perform overlap checking by sampling the; volume with \<`number`\> random points (default 1 million).

With a copying garbage collector, derived pointers must not be retained across; collector safe points; the collector could move the objects and invalidate the; derived pointer. This is bad enough in the first place, but safe points can; crop up unpredictably. Consider:. %array = load { i32, [0 x %obj] }** %array_addr; %nth_el = getelementptr { i32, [0 x %obj] }* %array, i32 0, i32 %n; %old = load %obj** %nth_el; %z = div i64 %x, %y; store %obj* %new, %obj** %nth_el. If the i64 division is lowered to a libcall, then a safe point will (must); appear for the call site. If a collection occurs, %array and %nth_el no longer; point into the correct object. The fix for this is to copy address calculations so that dependent pointers; are never live across safe point boundaries.

These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager.

Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation. Regardless of which kind of profiling you use, be careful to collect profiles; by running your code with inputs that are representative of the typical; behavior. Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling. Differences Between Sampling and Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although both techniques are used for similar purposes, there are important; differences between the two:. 1. Profile data generated with one cannot be used by the other, and there is no; conversion tool that can convert one to the other. So, a profile generated; via ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` must be used with; ``-fprofile-use`` or ``-fprofile-instr-use``. Similarly, sampling profiles; generated by external profilers must be converted and used with ``-fprofile-sample-use``; or ``-fauto-profile``. 2.

The clause consists of an array of type infos.; ``landingpad`` will return a negative value; if the exception does not match any of the type infos. If no match is found then; a call to ``__cxa_call_unexpected`` should be made, otherwise; ``_Unwind_Resume``. Each of these functions requires a reference to the; exception structure. Note that the most general form of a ``landingpad``; instruction can have any number of catch, cleanup, and filter clauses (though; having more than one cleanup is pointless). The LLVM C++ front-end can generate; such ``landingpad`` instructions due to inlining creating nested exception; handling scopes. Restrictions; ------------. The unwinder delegates the decision of whether to stop in a call frame to that; call frame's language-specific personality function. Not all unwinders guarantee; that they will stop to perform cleanups. For example, the GNU C++ unwinder; doesn't do so unless the exception is actually caught somewhere further up the; stack. In order for inlining to behave correctly, landing pads must be prepared to; handle selector results that they did not originally advertise. Suppose that a; function catches exceptions of type ``A``, and it's inlined into a function that; catches exceptions of type ``B``. The inliner will update the ``landingpad``; instruction for the inlined landing pad to include the fact that ``B`` is also; caught. If that landing pad assumes that it will only be entered to catch an; ``A``, it's in for a rude awakening. Consequently, landing pads must test for; the selector results they understand and then resume exception propagation with; the `resume instruction <LangRef.html#i_resume>`_ if none of the conditions; match.

As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:18025,perform,performance,18025,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

The linker completes its usual; symbol resolution pass and finds that ``foo2()`` is not used; anywhere. This information is used by the LLVM optimizer and it; removes ``foo2()``. * As soon as ``foo2()`` is removed, the optimizer recognizes that condition ``i; < 0`` is always false, which means ``foo3()`` is never used. Hence, the; optimizer also removes ``foo3()``. * And this in turn, enables linker to remove ``foo4()``. This example illustrates the advantage of tight integration with the; linker. Here, the optimizer can not remove ``foo3()`` without the linker's; input. Alternative Approaches; ----------------------. **Compiler driver invokes link time optimizer separately.**; In this model the link time optimizer is not able to take advantage of; information collected during the linker's normal symbol resolution phase.; In the above example, the optimizer can not remove ``foo2()`` without the; linker's input because it is externally visible. This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary.

The interpreter is activated using the following flags:. * ``-fexperimental-new-constant-interpreter`` enables the interpreter,; emitting an error if an unsupported feature is encountered. Bytecode Compilation; ====================. Bytecode compilation is handled in ``ByteCodeStmtGen.h`` for statements; and ``ByteCodeExprGen.h`` for expressions. The compiler has two different; backends: one to generate bytecode for functions (``ByteCodeEmitter``) and; one to directly evaluate expressions as they are compiled, without; generating bytecode (``EvalEmitter``). All functions are compiled to; bytecode, while toplevel expressions used in constant contexts are directly; evaluated since the bytecode would never be reused. This mechanism aims to; pave the way towards replacing the evaluator, improving its performance on; functions and loops, while being just as fast on single-use toplevel; expressions. The interpreter relies on stack-based, strongly-typed opcodes. The glue; logic between the code generator, along with the enumeration and; description of opcodes, can be found in ``Opcodes.td``. The opcodes are; implemented as generic template methods in ``Interp.h`` and instantiated; with the relevant primitive types by the interpreter loop or by the; evaluating emitter. Primitive Types; ---------------. * ``PT_{U|S}int{8|16|32|64}``. Signed or unsigned integers of a specific bit width, implemented using; the ```Integral``` type. * ``PT_{U|S}intFP``. Signed or unsigned integers of an arbitrary, but fixed width used to; implement integral types which are required by the target, but are not; supported by the host. Under the hood, they rely on APValue. The; ``Integral`` specialisation for these types is required by opcodes to; share an implementation with fixed integrals. * ``PT_Bool``.

The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero.

The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The CoalescingBitVector container is similar in principle to a SparseBitVector,; but is optimized to represent large contiguous ranges of set bits compactly. It; does this by coalescing contiguous ranges of set bits into intervals. Searching; for a bit in a CoalescingBitVector is O(log(gaps between contiguous ranges)). CoalescingBitVector is a better choice than BitVector when gaps between ranges; of set bits are large. It's a better choice than SparseBitVector when find(); operations must have fast, predictable performance. However, it's not a good; choice for representing sets which have lots of very short ranges. E.g. the set; `{2*x : x \in [0, n)}` would be a pathological input. .. _utility_functions:. Useful Utility Functions; ========================.

The ``DEBUG_WITH_TYPE`` macro is also available for situations where you would; like to set ``DEBUG_TYPE``, but only for one specific ``DEBUG`` statement. It; takes an additional first parameter, which is the type to use. For example, the; preceding example could be written as:. .. code-block:: c++.

The ``Statistic`` class & ``-stats`` option; -------------------------------------------. The ``llvm/ADT/Statistic.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Statistic_8h_source.html>`__) file provides a class; named ``Statistic`` that is used as a unified way to keep track of what the LLVM; compiler is doing and how effective various optimizations are. It is useful to; see what optimizations are contributing to making a particular program run; faster. Often you may run your pass on some big program, and you're interested to see; how many times it makes a certain transformation. Although you can do this with; hand inspection, or some ad-hoc method, this is a real pain and not very useful; for big programs. Using the ``Statistic`` class makes it very easy to keep; track of this information, and the calculated information is presented in a; uniform manner with the rest of the passes being executed. There are many examples of ``Statistic`` uses, but the basics of using it are as; follows:. Define your statistic like this:. .. code-block:: c++. #define DEBUG_TYPE ""mypassname"" // This goes after any #includes.; STATISTIC(NumXForms, ""The # of times I did stuff"");.

Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment. That way, the position of the; store and marker can be considered together when making that choice. Another; important benefit of referring to the store is that we can then build a two-way; mapping of stores<->markers that can be used to find markers that need to be; updated when stores are modified. An `llvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```. The first three parameters look and behave like an `llvm.dbg.value`. `ID` is a; reference to a store (see next section). `Address` is the destination address; of the store and it is modified by `AddressExpression`. An empty/undef/poison; address means the address component has been killed (the memory address is no; longer a valid location). LLVM currently encodes variable fragment information; in `DIExpression`s, so as an implementation quirk the `FragmentInfo` for; `Variable` is contained within `ValueExpression` only.

Vector Builtins; ---------------. **Note: The implementation of vector builtins is work-in-progress and incomplete.**. In addition to the operators mentioned above, Clang provides a set of builtins; to perform additional operations on certain scalar and vector types. Let ``T`` be one of the following types:. * an integer type (as in C23 6.2.5p22), but excluding enumerated types and ``bool``; * the standard floating types float or double; * a half-precision floating point type, if one is supported on the target; * a vector type. For scalar types, consider the operation applied to a vector with a single element. *Vector Size*; To determine the number of elements in a vector, use ``__builtin_vectorelements()``.; For fixed-sized vectors, e.g., defined via ``__attribute__((vector_size(N)))`` or ARM; NEON's vector types (e.g., ``uint16x8_t``), this returns the constant number of; elements at compile-time. For scalable vectors, e.g., SVE or RISC-V V, the number of; elements is not known at compile-time and is determined at runtime. This builtin can; be used, e.g., to increment the loop-counter in vector-type agnostic loops. *Elementwise Builtins*. Each builtin returns a vector equivalent to applying the specified operation; elementwise to the input. Unless specified otherwise operation(±0) = ±0 and operation(±infinity) = ±infinity. =========================================== ================================================================ =========================================; Name Operation Supported element types; =========================================== ================================================================ =========================================; T __builtin_elementwise_abs(T x) return the absolute value of a number x; the absolute value of signed integer and floating point types; the most negative integer remains the most negative integer; T __builtin_elementwise_fma(T x, T y",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:21630,scalab,scalable,21630,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['scalab'],['scalable']

Once; all parameters are added to MnUserParameters, they can fix a parameter or; put limits on another one before handing them over to Minuit for; minimization. ### What the user can supply ###. Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###.

These intrinsics work for both fixed and scalable vectors. While this intrinsic; is marked as experimental, the recommended way to express this operation for; fixed-width vectors is still to use a shufflevector, as that may allow for more; optimization opportunities. For example:. .. code-block:: text. llvm.experimental.vector.splice(<A,B,C,D>, <E,F,G,H>, 1); ==> <B, C, D, E> index; llvm.experimental.vector.splice(<A,B,C,D>, <E,F,G,H>, -3); ==> <B, C, D, E> trailing elements. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first two operands are vectors with the same type. The start index is imm; modulo the runtime number of elements in the source vector. For a fixed-width; vector <N x eltty>, imm is a signed integer constant in the range; -N <= imm < N. For a scalable vector <vscale x N x eltty>, imm is a signed; integer constant in the range -X <= imm < X where X=vscale_range_min * N.

Performance,"nce critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up and binding; the method before the loop, and discarding it afterwards. Here is an; example:. ``` {.cpp}; hpx = TH1F('hpx','px',100,-4,4); hpxFill = hpx.Fill # cache bound method; for i in xrange(25000):; px = gRandom.Gaus(); hpxFill(px) # use bound method: no lookup needed; del hpxFill # done with cached method; ```. Note that if you do not discard the bound method, a reference to the; histogram will remain outstanding, and it will not be deleted when it; should be.

Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state. We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

Performance,"nce. We introduced an optimized infrastructure for reading objects using a StreamerInfo. Rather than driving the streaming using a switch statement inside TStreamerInfo::ReadBuffer,; the streaming is now driven using a simple loop over a sequence of configured StreamerInfo actions. This improves run-time performance by allowing a dramatic reduction in function calls and code; branches at the expense of some code duplication. There are 3 versions of this loop implemented in TBufferFile and overloaded in TBufferXML and TBufferSQL:. virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence, void *object);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);. The 1st version is optimized to read a single object. The 2nd version is optimized to read the content of TClonesArrays and vectors of pointers to objects. The 3rd version is used to streamed any collections. TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.). A TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence is an ordered sequence of configured actions. A configured action has both an action which is a free standing function and a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TConfiguration. The configuration contains information that is specific to the action; but varies from use to use, including the offset from the beginning of the object that needs to be updated.; Other examples of configuration include the number of bits requested for storing a Double32_t or its factor and minimum.

Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change.

Performance,"nctionality out into the `ConstantTermsOptimizer` class.; In fact, it is not so much a class, as it is a collection of static functions that can be applied to any combination of pdf and dataset.; This class does essentially the same as `constOptimizeTestStatistic` did on a `RooNLLVar`, except that it has been factored out into a separate class. ### Usage example: apply constant term optimization on pdf and dataset inside a likelihood; Applying the default `ConstantTermsOptimizer` optimization routines on the pdf and dataset inside a `RooAbsL` likelihood is as simple as:. ``` {.cpp}; likelihood.constOptimizeTestStatistic();; ```; This applies constant term optimization to the cloned pdf and dataset inside the likelihood object.; It will not modify anything outside of the likelihood. Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```. For the adventurous user, it is also possible to apply constant term optimization to a pdf and dataset directly without needing a likelihood object, e.g. given some `RooArgSet` set of observables `normSet`:; ``` {.cpp}; bool applyTrackingOpt = true;; ConstantTermsOptimizer::enableConstantTermsOptimization(&pdf, &normSet, dataset, applyTrackingOpt);; ```; We refer to RooFit documentation for more about ""tracking optimization"" which can be enabled or disabled using the final boolean parameter. ## Caveats; This package is still under development.; Some functionality that users of `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` or `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` were used to has not yet been ported to this namespace.; However, the functionality that is implemented has been tested thoroughly for a set of common usage patterns and should work as expected.

A delta between Dispatch Width and the theoretical maximum uOps per; Cycle (computed by dividing the number of uOps of a single iteration by the; `Block RThroughput`) is an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the; lack of hardware resources.; In general, the lower the Block RThroughput, the better. In this example, ``uOps per iteration/Block RThroughput`` is 1.50. Since there; are no loop-carried dependencies, the observed `uOps Per Cycle` is expected to; approach 1.50 when the number of iterations tends to infinity. The delta between; the Dispatch Width (2.00), and the theoretical maximum uOp throughput (1.50) is; an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the lack of hardware; resources, and the *Resource pressure view* can help to identify the problematic; resource usage. The second section of the report is the `instruction info view`. It shows the; latency and reciprocal throughput of every instruction in the sequence. It also; reports extra information related to the number of micro opcodes, and opcode; properties (i.e., 'MayLoad', 'MayStore', and 'HasSideEffects'). Field *RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the instruction throughput. Throughput; is computed as the maximum number of instructions of a same type that can be; executed per clock cycle in the absence of operand dependencies.

In particular, the new interfaces are type-safe through the use of; templates, and the ownership is well-defined through the use of smart pointers. For instance. tree->Branch(""px"", &Category, ""px/F"");. becomes. auto px = model->MakeField<float>(""px"");; // px is std::shared_ptr<float>. The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`.

One can find fast if a point different from the current one has or not; the same location inside the geometry tree. To do that, the new point; should not be introduced by using `TGeoManager::SetCurrentPoint()`; method, but rather by calling the specific method:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(Double_t x,Double_t y,; Double_t z,Bool_t change=kFALSE);; ```. In the prototype above, `x, y` and `z` are the coordinates of the new; point. The modeller will check whether the current volume still contains; the new point or its location has changed in the geometry hierarchy. If; the new location is different, two actions are possible according to the; value of `change`:. - `change = kFALSE` (default) - the modeller does not change the; current state but just inform the caller about this change.; - `change = kTRUE` - the modeller will actually perform a new; `‘Where am I?' `search after finding out that the location has; changed. The current state will be actualized accordingly. Note that even when performing a normal search on the current state; after changing the current point coordinates (e.g.; `gGeoManager->FindNode(newX,newY,newZ)`), users can always query if the; previous state has changed by using a method having the same name but; without parameters:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoManager::IsSameLocation();; ```. #### Finding the Distance to the Next Boundary. All tracking engines need to compare the currently proposed physical; step with the maximum allowed distance in the current material. The; modeller provides this information by computing the distance to the; first boundary starting from the current point along a straight line.; The starting point and direction for this procedure are the ones; corresponding to the current state.

To aleviate the pain for Windows users who want to try ROOT 6 we provide; a recipe on how to run ROOT 6 in a VM on Windows. Building ROOT also requires a C++11 compatible compiler, so one needs to either have installed gcc >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.4.

The advantages are reduced memory consumption (due to; the smaller pointers) and increased performance compared to 32 bit; applications due to the availability of the 64 bit instructions.

This; is not intended to be a precise guide to the semantics; the details can get; extremely complicated and unreadable, and are not usually necessary. .. _Optimization outside atomic:. Optimization outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time.

That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part; of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory; operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly; equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a; Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release; store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a; Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some; complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details. Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the; target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and; therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be; impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:.

If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y.

Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to change the representation to be as if it had been loaded by an ``LD1`` of type ``Y``. For the previous example, this would be::. LD1 v0.4s, [x]. REV64 v0.4s, v0.4s // There is no REV128 instruction, so it must be synthesizedcd; EXT v0.16b, v0.16b, v0.16b, #8 // with a REV64 then an EXT to swap the two 64-bit elements. REV64 v0.2d, v0.2d; EXT v0.16b, v0.16b, v0.16b, #8. ST1 v0.2d, [y]. It turns out that these ``REV`` pairs can, in almost all cases, be squashed together into a single ``REV``. For the example above, a ``REV128 4s`` + ``REV128 2d`` is actually a ``REV64 4s``, as shown in the figure on the right. ..

Performance,"ndex.html). ## Core Libraries. ### Dictionary generation. Fixed the dictionary generation in the case of class inside a namespace; marked inlined. Added mechanisms to stop the dictionary generation while parsing the XML and while selecting in presence of duplicates. Fix [ROOT-7760] : fully allow the usage of the dylib extension on OSx. Fix [ROOT-7723] : allow IOCtors to have as argument a ref to a type called __void__. We added a dictionary for map<string,string> as part of the default STL dictionary. We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ### Thread safety and thread awareness. We added the function `TMethodCall::GetCallFunc` to allow direct access to the function wrapper. We reduced thread serialization in `TClass::GetCheckSum`, `TClass::GetBaseClassOffset` and `TClass::Property`. `TObjArray::Delete` was updated to allow its caller to explicitly avoid costly checks (extra RecursiveRemove and lock). We removed the need to create a TThread object per thread in a multi-threaded application. Now ROOT can be used with any threading model (e.g. OpenMP, STL threads, TBB) transparently. All the internal synchronisation mechanisms of ROOT are activated by a single call: `ROOT::EnableThreadSafety()` which is the successor of the existing `TThread::Initialize`. This call must take place if ROOT needs to be used in a thread safe manner. The implementation of TSemaphore was redone based on C++11 thread primitive in order to prevent cases where some of request post were lost. ### TDirectory::TContext. We added a default constructor to `TDirectory::TContext` which record the current directory; and will restore it at destruction time and does not change the current directory.

In an init method, ``self``; follows the :ref:``init family rules <arc.family.semantics.init>``. .. admonition:: Rationale. The cost of retaining ``self`` in all methods was found to be prohibitive, as; it tends to be live across calls, preventing the optimizer from proving that; the retain and release are unnecessary --- for good reason, as it's quite; possible in theory to cause an object to be deallocated during its execution; without this retain and release. Since it's extremely uncommon to actually; do so, even unintentionally, and since there's no natural way for the; programmer to remove this retain/release pair otherwise (as there is for; other parameters by, say, making the variable ``objc_externally_retained`` or; qualifying it with ``__unsafe_unretained``), we chose to make this optimizing; assumption and shift some amount of risk to the user. .. _arc.misc.enumeration:.

Performance,"nding dead code behind A/B experiment flags. Finding dead code is a classic application of data flow analysis. Unused flags for A/B experiment hide dead code. However, this flavor of dead; code is invisible to the compiler because the flag can be turned on at any; moment. We could make a tool that deletes experiment flags. The user tells us which flag; they want to delete, and we assume that the it's value is a given constant. For example, the user could use the tool to remove `example_flag` from this; code:. ```c++; DEFINE_FLAG(std::string, example_flag, """", ""A sample flag."");. void Example() {; bool x = GetFlag(FLAGS_example_flag).empty();; f();; if (x) {; g();; } else {; h();; }; }; ```. The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors. Unfortunately this; strategy does not work when you are refactoring types that implicitly convert to; each other, for example, replacing `i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:28858,perform,performs,28858,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['perform'],['performs']

Even if the assumed property can be encoded as a boolean value, like; ``nonnull``, using operand bundles to express the property can still have; benefits:. * Attributes that can be expressed via operand bundles are directly the; property that the optimizer uses and cares about.

Recently, Google Project Zero and other researchers have found information leak; vulnerabilities by exploiting speculative execution in modern CPUs. These; exploits are currently broken down into three variants:; * GPZ Variant #1 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #1): Bounds check (or predicate) bypass; * GPZ Variant #2 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #2): Branch target injection; * GPZ Variant #3 (a.k.a. Meltdown): Rogue data cache load. For more details, see the Google Project Zero blog post and the Spectre research; paper:; * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html; * https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf. The core problem of GPZ Variant #1 is that speculative execution uses branch; prediction to select the path of instructions speculatively executed. This path; is speculatively executed with the available data, and may load from memory and; leak the loaded values through various side channels that survive even when the; speculative execution is unwound due to being incorrect. Mispredicted paths can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data. Here is an example,; extracted and simplified from the Project Zero paper:; ```; struct array {; unsigned long length;; unsigned char data[];; };; struct array *arr1 = ...; // small array; struct array *arr2 = ...; // array of size 0x400; unsigned long untrusted_offset_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_offset_from_caller < arr1->length) {; unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset_from_caller];; unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200;; unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];; }; ```.

Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword.

Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local.

If ``%n`` is ``0``, then the result is a; poison value. The above is equivalent to:. ::. %m = @llvm.get.active.lane.mask(%base, %n). This can, for example, be emitted by the loop vectorizer in which case; ``%base`` is the first element of the vector induction variable (VIV) and; ``%n`` is the loop tripcount. Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow.

In order to solve these issues we need to:. * Have a format that can be mapped into memory from disk and used as is; * Lookups should be very fast; * Extensible table format so these tables can be made by many producers; * Contain all of the names needed for typical lookups out of the box; * Strict rules for the contents of tables. Table size is important and the accelerator table format should allow the reuse; of strings from common string tables so the strings for the names are not; duplicated. We also want to make sure the table is ready to be used as-is by; simply mapping the table into memory with minimal header parsing. The name lookups need to be fast and optimized for the kinds of lookups that; debuggers tend to do. Optimally we would like to touch as few parts of the; mapped table as possible when doing a name lookup and be able to quickly find; the name entry we are looking for, or discover there are no matches. In the; case of debuggers we optimized for lookups that fail most of the time.

Performance,"nfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:28789,load,load,28789,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"nformation collected during the linker's normal symbol resolution phase.; In the above example, the optimizer can not remove ``foo2()`` without the; linker's input because it is externally visible. This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer. Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles.

Performance,"ng IR to the JIT and making it available for execution. In; this initial implementation of our JIT we will make our modules ""available for; execution"" by adding them to the CompileLayer, which will it turn store the; Module in the main JITDylib. This process will create new symbol table entries; in the JITDylib for each definition in the module, and will defer compilation of; the module until any of its definitions is looked up. Note that this is not lazy; compilation: just referencing a definition, even if it is never used, will be; enough to trigger compilation. In later chapters we will teach our JIT to defer; compilation of functions until they're actually called. To add our Module we; must first wrap it in a ThreadSafeModule instance, which manages the lifetime of; the Module's LLVMContext (our Ctx member) in a thread-friendly way. In our; example, all modules will share the Ctx member, which will exist for the; duration of the JIT. Once we switch to concurrent compilation in later chapters; we will use a new context per module. Our last method is ``lookup``, which allows us to look up addresses for; function and variable definitions added to the JIT based on their symbol names.; As noted above, lookup will implicitly trigger compilation for any symbol; that has not already been compiled. Our lookup method calls through to; `ExecutionSession::lookup`, passing in a list of dylibs to search (in our case; just the main dylib), and the symbol name to search for, with a twist: We have; to *mangle* the name of the symbol we're searching for first. The ORC JIT; components use mangled symbols internally the same way a static compiler and; linker would, rather than using plain IR symbol names. This allows JIT'd code; to interoperate easily with precompiled code in the application or shared; libraries.

Performance,"ng `Alias`, it is now possible to register homonymous aliases (alternative column names) in different branches of the computation graph, in line with the behavior of `Define` (until now, aliases were required to be unique in the whole computaton graph).; - The `Histo*D` methods now support the combination of scalar values and vector-like weight values. For each entry, the histogram is filled once for each weight, always with the same scalar value.; - The `Histo*D` methods do not work on columns of type `std::string` anymore. They used to fill the histogram with the integer value corresponding to each of the characters in the string. Please use `Fill` with a custom class to recover the old behavior if that was what was desired. ### Other improvements. - The scaling to a large amount of threads of computation graphs with many simple `Filter`s or `Define`s has been greatly improved, see also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036730/#1-a-performance-study-of-the-r) for more details; - The output format of `Display` has been significantly improved.; - The `Fill` method now correctly supports user-defined classes with arbitrary `Fill` signatures (see [#9428](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9428)). ### Experimental Distributed RDataFrame.

If either is; outside of it, integer arithmetic wrapping may occur, so the comparison may not; be meaningful. Can I do GEP with a different pointer type than the type of the underlying object?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes. There are no restrictions on bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------. You can compute an address that way, but if you use GEP to do the add, you can't; use that pointer to actually access the object, unless the object is managed; outside of LLVM. The underlying integer computation is sufficiently defined; null has a defined; value --- zero --- and you can add whatever value you want to it. However, it's invalid to access (load from or store to) an LLVM-aware object; with such a pointer. This includes ``GlobalVariables``, ``Allocas``, and objects; pointed to by noalias pointers. If you really need this functionality, you can do the arithmetic with explicit; integer instructions, and use inttoptr to convert the result to an address.

The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23556,load,loaded,23556,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"ng the original; source from generated code. .. _intro_debugopt:. Debug information and optimizations; -----------------------------------. An extremely high priority of LLVM debugging information is to make it interact; well with optimizations and analysis. In particular, the LLVM debug; information provides the following guarantees:. * LLVM debug information **always provides information to accurately read; the source-level state of the program**, regardless of which LLVM; optimizations have been run. :doc:`HowToUpdateDebugInfo` specifies how debug; info should be updated in various kinds of code transformations to avoid; breaking this guarantee, and how to preserve as much useful debug info as; possible. Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:4461,optimiz,optimizations,4461,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimizations', 'perform']"
Performance,"ng this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel.

This is; the default when the input is a header file. * **IR generation**: This converts the source-level intermediate representation; into an optimizer-specific intermediate representation (IR); for Clang, this; is LLVM IR.; The ``-emit-llvm`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. If combined; with ``-S``, Clang will produce textual LLVM IR; otherwise, it will produce; LLVM IR bitcode. * **Compiler backend**: This converts the intermediate representation; into target-specific assembly code.; The ``-S`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Assembler**: This converts target-specific assembly code into; target-specific machine code object files.; The ``-c`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Linker**: This combines multiple object files into a single image; (either a shared object or an executable). Clang provides all of these pieces other than the linker. When multiple; steps are performed by the same tool, it is common for the steps to be; fused together to avoid creating intermediate files. When given an output of one of the above steps as an input, earlier steps; are skipped (for instance, a ``.s`` file input will be assembled and linked). The Clang driver can be invoked with the ``-###`` flag (this argument will need; to be escaped under most shells) to see which commands it would run for the; above steps, without running them.

Differences Between Sampling and Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although both techniques are used for similar purposes, there are important; differences between the two:. 1. Profile data generated with one cannot be used by the other, and there is no; conversion tool that can convert one to the other. So, a profile generated; via ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` must be used with; ``-fprofile-use`` or ``-fprofile-instr-use``. Similarly, sampling profiles; generated by external profilers must be converted and used with ``-fprofile-sample-use``; or ``-fauto-profile``. 2. Instrumentation profile data can be used for code coverage analysis and; optimization. 3. Sampling profiles can only be used for optimization. They cannot be used for; code coverage analysis. Although it would be technically possible to use; sampling profiles for code coverage, sample-based profiles are too; coarse-grained for code coverage purposes; it would yield poor results. 4. Sampling profiles must be generated by an external tool. The profile; generated by that tool must then be converted into a format that can be read; by LLVM.

Performance,"ngs; ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,; there are six levels of atomicity. They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:6584,load,loads,6584,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

A progress bar is a widget that shows that an operation is in progress; and how much time is left. It is a long rectangular bar, initially; empty, that fills with a color as a process is being performed. The; filled-in area indicates the percentage of the process that has been; completed. You should use this widget for waits exceeding `one minute`.; For a very time consuming operation it is better to break the operation; into subtasks and provide a progress bar for each of them. ![](pictures/0200021E.jpg). A progress bar may be oriented horizontally or vertically. The; horizontally oriented progress bar fills with a color from left to; right; the vertically oriented - from bottom to top. A percent complete; message provides an indication of the completed part of the process. It; is a good practice to include some descriptive text of the process to; keep users informed and entertained while they are waiting for process; completion.

Performance,"nits that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant. If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module. A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific; numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces; may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target; instructions are used to access the variable. The default address space; is zero. The address space qualifier must precede any other attributes. LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for globals. If the; target supports it, it will emit globals to the section specified.; Additionally, the global can placed in a comdat if the target has the necessary; support. External declarations may have an explicit section specified. Section; information is retained in LLVM IR for targets that make use of this; information. Attaching section information to an external declaration is an; assertion that its definition is located in the specified section. If the; definition is located in a different section, the behavior is undefined. LLVM allows an explicit code model to be specified for globals.

Performance,"nk the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the shared object is lazily loaded. Phase 2 : Symbol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files.

Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view. Our goal is to take advantage of tight; integration between the linker and the optimizer by sharing this information; during various linking phases. Phase 1 : Read LLVM Bitcode Files; ---------------------------------. The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool.

Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```. To use Clang frontend's PGO instead of LLVM IR PGO, set `-DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=OFF`. The `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` setting only affects the SPEC benchmark suites.

Performance,"no need; for your front-end to build SSA form: LLVM provides highly tuned and; well tested support for this, though the way it works is a bit; unexpected for some. Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. To understand why mutable variables cause complexities in SSA; construction, consider this extremely simple C example:. .. code-block:: c. int G, H;; int test(_Bool Condition) {; int X;; if (Condition); X = G;; else; X = H;; return X;; }. In this case, we have the variable ""X"", whose value depends on the path; executed in the program. Because there are two different possible values; for X before the return instruction, a PHI node is inserted to merge the; two values. The LLVM IR that we want for this example looks like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.2; }. In this example, the loads from the G and H global variables are; explicit in the LLVM IR, and they live in the then/else branches of the; if statement (cond\_true/cond\_false). In order to merge the incoming; values, the X.2 phi node in the cond\_next block selects the right value; to use based on where control flow is coming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form. For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_.

In many common situations, ARC knows when an; object is created and when it is destroyed and can ensure that these; operations are performed correctly.

For example, there is no syntactic difference in C between; an assignment that is intended by the programmer to initialize a variable; and one that is intended to replace the existing value stored there,; but ARC must perform one operation or the other. ARC chooses to always; assume that objects are initialized (except when it is in charge of; initializing them) because the only workable alternative would be to; ban all code patterns that could potentially be used to access; uninitialized memory, and that would be too limiting. In practice,; this is rarely a problem because programmers do not generally need to; work with objects for which the requirements are not handled; automatically.

The ``ModulePass`` class; ------------------------. The `ModulePass <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1ModulePass.html>`_ class; is the most general of all superclasses that you can use. Deriving from; ``ModulePass`` indicates that your pass uses the entire program as a unit,; referring to function bodies in no predictable order, or adding and removing; functions. Because nothing is known about the behavior of ``ModulePass``; subclasses, no optimization can be done for their execution. A module pass can use function level passes (e.g. dominators) using the; ``getAnalysis`` interface ``getAnalysis<DominatorTree>(llvm::Function *)`` to; provide the function to retrieve analysis result for, if the function pass does; not require any module or immutable passes. Note that this can only be done; for functions for which the analysis ran, e.g. in the case of dominators you; should only ask for the ``DominatorTree`` for function definitions, not; declarations. To write a correct ``ModulePass`` subclass, derive from ``ModulePass`` and; override the ``runOnModule`` method with the following signature:. The ``runOnModule`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. code-block:: c++. virtual bool runOnModule(Module &M) = 0;. The ``runOnModule`` method performs the interesting work of the pass.

Performance,"ns for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables. Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode.

Performance,"ns to be; aware of. Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:. Global Variables; ----------------. Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time; instead of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`.

Performance,"ns. Because metadata nodes are immutable (with the exception of; ``MDNode::replaceOperandWith`` which is dangerous to use on uniqued; metadata), in order to add or remove a loop attributes, a new ``MDNode``; must be created and assigned as the new ``llvm.loop`` metadata. Any; connection between the old ``MDNode`` and the loop is lost. The; ``llvm.loop`` node is also used as LoopID (``Loop::getLoopID()``), i.e.; the loop effectively gets a new identifier. For instance,; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` references the LoopID. Therefore, if; the parallel access property is to be preserved after adding/removing; loop attributes, any ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` reference must be; updated to the new LoopID. Transformation Metadata Structure; =================================. Some attributes describe code transformations (unrolling, vectorizing,; loop distribution, etc.). They can either be a hint to the optimizer; that a transformation might be beneficial, instruction to use a specific; option, , or convey a specific request from the user (such as; ``#pragma clang loop`` or ``#pragma omp simd``). If a transformation is forced but cannot be carried-out for any reason,; an optimization-missed warning must be emitted. Semantic information; such as a transformation being safe (e.g.; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``) can be unused by the optimizer; without generating a warning. Unless explicitly disabled, any optimization pass may heuristically; determine whether a transformation is beneficial and apply it. If; metadata for another transformation was specified, applying a different; transformation before it might be inadvertent due to being applied on a; different loop or the loop not existing anymore. To avoid having to; explicitly disable an unknown number of passes, the attribute; ``llvm.loop.disable_nonforced`` disables all optional, high-level,; restructuring transformations.

Performance,"ns; --------------------------------------. The LLVM IR does not define any way to start parallel threads of; execution or to register signal handlers. Nonetheless, there are; platform-specific ways to create them, and we define LLVM IR's behavior; in their presence. This model is inspired by the C++ memory model. For a more informal introduction to this model, see the :doc:`Atomics`. We define a *happens-before* partial order as the least partial order; that. - Is a superset of single-thread program order, and; - When ``a`` *synchronizes-with* ``b``, includes an edge from ``a`` to; ``b``. *Synchronizes-with* pairs are introduced by platform-specific; techniques, like pthread locks, thread creation, thread joining,; etc., and by atomic instructions. (See also :ref:`Atomic Memory Ordering; Constraints <ordering>`). Note that program order does not introduce *happens-before* edges; between a thread and signals executing inside that thread. Every (defined) read operation (load instructions, memcpy, atomic; loads/read-modify-writes, etc.) R reads a series of bytes written by; (defined) write operations (store instructions, atomic; stores/read-modify-writes, memcpy, etc.). For the purposes of this; section, initialized globals are considered to have a write of the; initializer which is atomic and happens before any other read or write; of the memory in question. For each byte of a read R, R\ :sub:`byte`; may see any write to the same byte, except:. - If write\ :sub:`1` happens before write\ :sub:`2`, and; write\ :sub:`2` happens before R\ :sub:`byte`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`1`.; - If R\ :sub:`byte` happens before write\ :sub:`3`, then; R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`3`. Given that definition, R\ :sub:`byte` is defined as follows:. - If R is volatile, the result is target-dependent.

Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state. We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

This allows; the inliner and other passes to reason about the semantics of the function; definition without needing to reason about the prologue data.

A trivial example of valid prologue data for the x86 architecture is ``i8 144``,; which encodes the ``nop`` instruction:. .. code-block:: text. define void @f() prologue i8 144 { ... }. Generally prologue data can be formed by encoding a relative branch instruction; which skips the metadata, as in this example of valid prologue data for the; x86_64 architecture, where the first two bytes encode ``jmp .+10``:. .. code-block:: text. %0 = type <{ i8, i8, ptr }>. define void @f() prologue %0 <{ i8 235, i8 8, ptr @md}> { ... }.

Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO.

To avoid having to; explicitly disable an unknown number of passes, the attribute; ``llvm.loop.disable_nonforced`` disables all optional, high-level,; restructuring transformations. The following example avoids the loop being altered before being; vectorized, for instance being unrolled. .. code-block:: llvm. br i1 %exitcond, label %for.exit, label %for.header, !llvm.loop !0; ...; !0 = distinct !{!0, !1, !2}; !1 = !{!""llvm.loop.vectorize.enable"", i1 true}; !2 = !{!""llvm.loop.disable_nonforced""}.

Performance,"nstrInfo::loadRegFromStackSlot``. The indirect mapping shields the application developer from the complexities of; inserting load and store instructions. In order to map a virtual register to a; physical one, use ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2Phys(vreg, preg)``. In order to map; a certain virtual register to memory, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg)``. This method will return the stack; slot where ``vreg``'s value will be located. If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instructions in the code. Every virtual that has; been mapped to a stack slot will be stored to memory after being defined and will; be loaded before being used. The implementation of the spiller tries to recycle; load/store instructions, avoiding unnecessary instructions. For an example of; how to invoke the spiller, see ``RegAllocLinearScan::runOnMachineFunction`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/RegAllocLinearScan.cpp``. Handling two address instructions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. With very rare exceptions (e.g., function calls), the LLVM machine code; instructions are three address instructions. That is, each instruction is; expected to define at most one register, and to use at most two registers.; However, some architectures use two address instructions. In this case, the; defined register is also one of the used registers.

We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention. We could define a new ABI and/or calling convention to explicitly pass the; predicate state in and out of functions. This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks. [Most](https://lwn.net/Articles/743265/); [discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:43319,perform,performance,43319,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`. Note that the; first initial suspend point is the compiler generated; `co_await promise_type::initial_suspend()`.

Unused values are optimized out, as well as the name of the local variable `a`.; The only information remained is the value of a 32 bit integer. In this simple; case, it seems to be pretty clear that `__int_32_0` represents `a`. However, it; is not true. An important note with optimization is that the value of a variable may not; properly express the intended value in the source code. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. static task coro_task(int v) {; int a = v;; co_await await_counter{};; a++; // __int_32_0 is 43 here; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here!; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; co_await await_counter{};; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here!!; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // Why is __int_32_0 still 43 here?; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; }.

Required passes will still be run on ``optnone`` functions. For more implementation details, see; ``PassInstrumentation::runBeforePass()``. Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Name##PluginInfo();``; - ``extern ""C"" ::llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo llvmGetPassPluginInfo() LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK;``. Pass plugins are compiled and linked dynamically by default. Setting; ``LLVM_${NAME}_LINK_INTO_TOOLS`` to ``ON`` turns the project into a statically; linked extension. For an in-tree example, see ``llvm/examples/Bye/``.

Performance,"nted by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself. You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAULT)). It is also possible to tune this 'cache-and-track' optimization to perform a more fine-grained caching; of components than Optimize(2) implements: to do so, call arg->setAttribute(""CacheAndTrack"") on each; pdf component that you'd like to be cache-and-tracked individually.

For example,; given the default specifications above, the i7 type will use the; alignment of i8 (next largest) while both i65 and i256 will use the; alignment of i64 (largest specified). The function of the data layout string may not be what you expect.; Notably, this is not a specification from the frontend of what alignment; the code generator should use. Instead, if specified, the target data layout is required to match what; the ultimate *code generator* expects. This string is used by the; mid-level optimizers to improve code, and this only works if it matches; what the ultimate code generator uses. There is no way to generate IR; that does not embed this target-specific detail into the IR.

Performance,"nter (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``. Since the second argument to the GEP instruction must always; be a value of pointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there.

If you want to add support for these templates, see the document; :doc:`How to set up LLVM-style RTTI for your class hierarchy; <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. .. _string_apis:. Passing strings (the ``StringRef`` and ``Twine`` classes); ---------------------------------------------------------. Although LLVM generally does not do much string manipulation, we do have several; important APIs which take strings. Two important examples are the Value class; -- which has names for instructions, functions, etc. -- and the ``StringMap``; class which is used extensively in LLVM and Clang. These are generic classes, and they need to be able to accept strings which may; have embedded null characters. Therefore, they cannot simply take a ``const; char *``, and taking a ``const std::string&`` requires clients to perform a heap; allocation which is usually unnecessary. Instead, many LLVM APIs use a; ``StringRef`` or a ``const Twine&`` for passing strings efficiently. .. _StringRef:. The ``StringRef`` class; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``StringRef`` data type represents a reference to a constant string (a; character array and a length) and supports the common operations available on; ``std::string``, but does not require heap allocation. It can be implicitly constructed using a C style null-terminated string, an; ``std::string``, or explicitly with a character pointer and length. For; example, the ``StringMap`` find function is declared as:. .. code-block:: c++. iterator find(StringRef Key);. and clients can call it using any one of:. .. code-block:: c++. Map.find(""foo""); // Lookup ""foo""; Map.find(std::string(""bar"")); // Lookup ""bar""; Map.find(StringRef(""\0baz"", 4)); // Lookup ""\0baz"".

Block pointers track a ``Pointee``, the block to which they point, along; with a ``Base`` and an ``Offset``. The base identifies the innermost field,; while the offset points to an array element relative to the base (including; one-past-end pointers). The offset identifies the array element or field; which is referenced, while the base points to the outer object or array which; contains the field.

[t] Jump threading (jumps to jumps with identical or inverse conditions); 5 . [t] CSE; 6 . *** Conversion to SSA ; 7 . [t] SSA Based DCE; 8 . *** Conversion to LLVM; 9 . UnSSA; 10. GCSE; 11.

Common profitable uses are for stack like data; structures (thus allowing dead store elimination) and for describing; life times of allocas (thus allowing smaller stack sizes). #. Mark invariant locations using !invariant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order.

If you didn't find what you were looking for above, consider proposing a piece; of metadata which provides the optimization hint you need.

Implications of ``-tailcallopt``:. To support tail call optimization in situations where the callee has more; arguments than the caller a 'callee pops arguments' convention is used. This; currently causes each ``fastcc`` call that is not tail call optimized (because; one or more of above constraints are not met) to be followed by a readjustment; of the stack. So performance might be worse in such cases. Sibling call optimization; -------------------------. Sibling call optimization is a restricted form of tail call optimization.; Unlike tail call optimization described in the previous section, it can be; performed automatically on any tail calls when ``-tailcallopt`` option is not; specified. Sibling call optimization is currently performed on x86/x86-64 when the; following constraints are met:. * Caller and callee have the same calling convention. It can be either ``c`` or; ``fastcc``. * The call is a tail call - in tail position (ret immediately follows call and; ret uses value of call or is void). * Caller and callee have matching return type or the callee result is not used. * If any of the callee arguments are being passed in stack, they must be; available in caller's own incoming argument stack and the frame offsets must; be the same. Example:. .. code-block:: llvm. declare i32 @bar(i32, i32). define i32 @foo(i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c) {; entry:; %0 = tail call i32 @bar(i32 %a, i32 %b); ret i32 %0; }.

In this case, it is sort of awkward that flag names correspond directly to enum; names, because we probably don't want an enum definition named ""``g``"" in our; program. Because of this, we can alternatively write this example like this:. .. code-block:: c++. enum OptLevel {; Debug, O1, O2, O3; };. cl::opt<OptLevel> OptimizationLevel(cl::desc(""Choose optimization level:""),; cl::values(; clEnumValN(Debug, ""g"", ""No optimizations, enable debugging""),; clEnumVal(O1 , ""Enable trivial optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O2 , ""Enable default optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O3 , ""Enable expensive optimizations"")));. ...; if (OptimizationLevel == Debug) outputDebugInfo(...);; ... By using the ""``clEnumValN``"" macro instead of ""``clEnumVal``"", we can directly; specify the name that the flag should get.

Performance,"nything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint. This prevents the optimizer; from performing unsound optimizations.; #. recording a mapping of live pointers (and the allocation they're; associated with) for each statepoint. At the most abstract level, inserting a safepoint can be thought of as; replacing a call instruction with a call to a multiple return value; function which both calls the original target of the call, returns; its result, and returns updated values for any live pointers to; garbage collected objects. Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below.

Performance,"o hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`.

LLVM Optimization Passes; ========================. LLVM provides many optimization passes, which do many different sorts of; things and have different tradeoffs. Unlike other systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst:3226,optimiz,optimizations,3226,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR. Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }. With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly. While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate.

The class loader utilizes so-called rootmap files, which by convention should; live alongside the dictionary shared library (and C++ module file).; These are simple text files, which map C++ entities (such as classes) to the; dictionaries and other libraries that need to be loaded for their use. With ``genreflex``, the mapping file can be automatically created with; ``--rootmap-lib=MyClassDict``, where ""MyClassDict"" is the name of the shared; library (without the extension) build from the dictionary file.; With ``rootcling``, create the same mapping file with; ``-rmf MyClassDict.rootmap -rml MyClassDict``.; It is necessary to provide the final library name explicitly, since it is; only in the separate linking step where these names are fixed and those names; may not match the default choice.

Performance,"oads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other.

That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``-noalias`` is the; only option). Essentially, there is no option to specify a different memory; type (e.g., write-back, write-combining, write-through; etc.) and consequently; to weaken, or strengthen, the memory model. Other limitations are:. * The LSUnit does not know when store-to-load forwarding may occur.; * The LSUnit does not know anything about cache hierarchy and memory types.; * The LSUnit does not know how to identify serializing operations and memory; fences. The LSUnit does not attempt to predict if a load or store hits or misses the L1; cache. It only knows if an instruction ""MayLoad"" and/or ""MayStore.""

Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```.

Object Loading; ==============. Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or; having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld to; be loaded. The RuntimeDyld wrapper class examines the object to determine; its file format and creates an instance of either RuntimeDyldELF or; RuntimeDyldMachO (both of which derive from the RuntimeDyldImpl base; class) and calls the RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject method to perform that; actual loading. .. image:: MCJIT-dyld-load.png.

RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use.

Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections.

Performance,"oc:`CMake` or :doc:`CMakePrimer`; documentation useful. Some of the things covered in this document are the inner; workings of the builds described in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:1438,perform,performance,1438,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

Reading and writing references in the heap; ------------------------------------------. Some collectors need to be informed when the mutator (the program that needs; garbage collection) either reads a pointer from or writes a pointer to a field; of a heap object. The code fragments inserted at these points are called *read; barriers* and *write barriers*, respectively. The amount of code that needs to; be executed is usually quite small and not on the critical path of any; computation, so the overall performance impact of the barrier is tolerable. Barriers often require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n.

The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks. This; is due to the inherent race condition of potentially several threads; trying to update the shared variable and the need for synchronization; around disposing of older values and copying new ones. Such; synchronization is beyond the scope of this language specification. Control Flow; ============.

Performance,"ocument goes over how ``MemorySSA`` is structured, and some basic; intuition on how ``MemorySSA`` works. A paper on MemorySSA (with notes about how it's implemented in GCC) `can be; found here <http://www.airs.com/dnovillo/Papers/mem-ssa.pdf>`_. Though, it's; relatively out-of-date; the paper references multiple memory partitions, but GCC; eventually swapped to just using one, like we now have in LLVM. Like; GCC's, LLVM's MemorySSA is intraprocedural. MemorySSA Structure; ===================. MemorySSA is a virtual IR. After it's built, ``MemorySSA`` will contain a; structure that maps ``Instruction``\ s to ``MemoryAccess``\ es, which are; ``MemorySSA``'s parallel to LLVM ``Instruction``\ s. Each ``MemoryAccess`` can be one of three types:. - ``MemoryDef``; - ``MemoryPhi``; - ``MemoryUse``. ``MemoryDef``\ s are operations which may either modify memory, or which; introduce some kind of ordering constraints. Examples of ``MemoryDef``\ s; include ``store``\ s, function calls, ``load``\ s with ``acquire`` (or higher); ordering, volatile operations, memory fences, etc. A ``MemoryDef``; always introduces a new version of the entire memory and is linked with a single; ``MemoryDef/MemoryPhi`` which is the version of memory that the new; version is based on. This implies that there is a *single*; ``Def`` chain that connects all the ``Def``\ s, either directly; or indirectly. For example in:. .. code-block:: llvm. b = MemoryDef(a); c = MemoryDef(b); d = MemoryDef(c). ``d`` is connected directly with ``c`` and indirectly with ``b``.; This means that ``d`` potentially clobbers (see below) ``c`` *or*; ``b`` *or* both. This in turn implies that without the use of `The walker`_,; initially every ``MemoryDef`` clobbers every other ``MemoryDef``. ``MemoryPhi``\ s are ``PhiNode``\ s, but for memory operations. If at any; point we have two (or more) ``MemoryDef``\ s that could flow into a; ``BasicBlock``, the block's top ``MemoryAccess`` will be a; ``MemoryPhi``.

Note that this guarantee is cheap on common; platforms for loads of a native width, but can be expensive or unavailable for; wider loads, like a 64-bit store on ARM. (A frontend for Java or other ""safe""; languages would normally split a 64-bit store on ARM into two 32-bit unordered; stores.). Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this prohibits any transformation that transforms a; single load into multiple loads, transforms a store into multiple stores,; narrows a store, or stores a value which would not be stored otherwise. Some; examples of unsafe optimizations are narrowing an assignment into a bitfield,; rematerializing a load, and turning loads and stores into a memcpy; call. Reordering unordered operations is safe, though, and optimizers should; take advantage of that because unordered operations are common in languages; that need them. Notes for code generation; These operations are required to be atomic in the sense that if you use; unordered loads and unordered stores, a load cannot see a value which was; never stored. A normal load or store instruction is usually sufficient, but; note that an unordered load or store cannot be split into multiple; instructions (or an instruction which does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM). Monotonic; ---------. Monotonic is the weakest level of atomicity that can be used in synchronization; primitives, although it does not provide any general synchronization.

Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition.

For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification.

There are two arguments to the ``store`` instruction: a value to store and an; address at which to store it. The type of the ``<pointer>`` operand must be a; pointer to the :ref:`first class <t_firstclass>` type of the ``<value>``; operand. If the ``store`` is marked as ``volatile``, then the optimizer is not; allowed to modify the number or order of execution of this ``store`` with other; :ref:`volatile operations <volatile>`. Only values of :ref:`first class; <t_firstclass>` types of known size (i.e. not containing an :ref:`opaque; structural type <t_opaque>`) can be stored. If the ``store`` is marked as ``atomic``, it takes an extra :ref:`ordering; <ordering>` and optional ``syncscope(""<target-scope>"")`` argument. The; ``acquire`` and ``acq_rel`` orderings aren't valid on ``store`` instructions.; Atomic loads produce :ref:`defined <memmodel>` results when they may see; multiple atomic stores. The type of the pointee must be an integer, pointer, or; floating-point type whose bit width is a power of two greater than or equal to; eight and less than or equal to a target-specific size limit. ``align`` must be; explicitly specified on atomic stores. Note: if the alignment is not greater or; equal to the size of the `<value>` type, the atomic operation is likely to; require a lock and have poor performance. ``!nontemporal`` does not have any; defined semantics for atomic stores. The optional constant ``align`` argument specifies the alignment of the; operation (that is, the alignment of the memory address). It is the; responsibility of the code emitter to ensure that the alignment information is; correct.

Performance,"oduction to the LLVM remark diagnostics; ===========================================. LLVM is able to emit diagnostics from passes describing whether an optimization; has been performed or missed for a particular reason, which should give more; insight to users about what the compiler did during the compilation pipeline. There are three main remark types:. ``Passed``. Remarks that describe a successful optimization performed by the compiler. :Example:. ::. foo inlined into bar with (cost=always): always inline attribute. ``Missed``. Remarks that describe an attempt to an optimization by the compiler that; could not be performed. :Example:. ::. foo not inlined into bar because it should never be inlined; (cost=never): noinline function attribute. ``Analysis``. Remarks that describe the result of an analysis, that can bring more; information to the user regarding the generated code. :Example:. ::. 16 stack bytes in function. ::. 10 instructions in function. Enabling optimization remarks; =============================. There are two modes that are supported for enabling optimization remarks in; LLVM: through remark diagnostics, or through serialized remarks. Remark diagnostics; ------------------.

We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own. For instance, `cat header.h header.h | gcc -fsyntax-only -xc++ -`.; This command concatenates `header.h` twice before compiling it to make sure; it has proper include protectors.; * Enable it in `rootcling` -- rootcling can produce a C++ Modules-aware; dictionary when it is invoked with `-cxxmodule` flag.; * Modularization of external dependencies -- if a header file is not explicitly; nominated as part of a module and it is transitively included in two modules,; both modules contain that header file content. In other words, the header is; duplicated. In turn, this leads to performance regressions. If a dictionary; depends on a header (directly or indirectly) from a external library (e.g.; libxml) it needs to be modularized. As part of our ongoing efforts to move; CMSSW to use C++ Modules [[6]] we have implemented a helper tool [[7]].

A state is always associated to a transformation matrix; `M` of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame; (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch; with respect to their containers). The current state and the; corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is; modified.

We copy the code from the original to the instrumentation version; by tracing the LLVM-to-Machine code basic block map and then copying; each machine code basic block we think is in the hot region into the; trace cache. Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code. So we have to keep the; code copies in memory near the original code (they can't be far enough; away that a single pc-relative branch would not work.) Malloc() or; data region space is too far away. this impacts the design of the ; trace cache. We use a dummy function that is full of a bunch of for loops which we; overwrite with trace-cache code. The trace manager keeps track of; whether or not we have enough space in the trace cache, etc. The trace insertion routine takes an original start address, a vector; of machine instructions representing the trace, index of branches and; their corresponding absolute targets, and index of calls and their; corresponding absolute targets. The trace insertion routine is responsible for inserting branches from; the beginning of the original code to the beginning of the optimized; trace. This is because at some point the trace cache may run out of; space and it may have to evict a trace, at which point the branch to; the trace would also have to be removed.

Performance,"of Volumes. The first thing one would like to do after building some geometry is to; visualize the volume tree. This provides the fastest validation check; for most common coding or design mistakes. As soon as the geometry is; successfully closed, one should draw it starting from the top-level; volume:. ``` {.cpp}; //... code for geometry building; root[] gGeoManager->CloseGeometry();; root[] gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw();; ```. Doing this ensures that the original top-level volume of the geometry is; drawn, even if another volume is currently the geometry `root`. OK, I; suppose you already did that with your simple geometry and immediately; noticed a new ROOT canvas popping-up and having some more or less; strange picture inside. Here are few questions that might come:. ***`Q:`*** ""The picture is strangely rotated; where are the coordinate axes?"". ***`A:`*** If drawn in a new canvas, any view has some default; viewpoint, center of view and size. One can then perform mouse/keyboard; actions to change them:. - Mouse left-click and drag will rotate the view;. - Some keys can be pressed when the view canvas is selected: J/K; zoom/un-zoom, U/I move up/down, L/H move left/right. The coordinate axes; display as well as changing top or side viewpoints can be activated from; the **`TView`** context menu: right-click on the picture when no object; is selected;. ***`Q:`*** ""Every line is black! I cannot figure out what is what..."". ***`A:`*** Volumes can have different colors (those known by ROOT of; course). Think at using them after each volume creation:; `myvolume->SetLineColor(Int_t color);` otherwise everything is by; default black. ***`Q:`*** ""The top volume of my geometry is a box but I see only its content."". ***`A:`*** By default the drawn volume is not displayed just because we; do not want to hide its content when changing the view to HLR or solid; mode.

Performance,"of a cluster size for the TTree. The TTreeCache; prefilling is also enabled by default; when in learning phase rather than; reading each requested branch individually, the TTreeCache will read all the; branches thus trading off the latencies inherent to multiple small reads for; the potential of requesting more data than needed by read from the disk or; server the baskets for too many branches. The default behavior can be changed by either updating one of the rootrc files; or by setting environment variables. The rootrc files, both the global and the; local ones, now support the following the resource variable TTreeCache.Size; which set the default size factor for auto sizing TTreeCache for TTrees. The; estimated cluster size for the TTree and this factor is used to give the cache; size. If option is set to zero auto cache creation is disabled and the default; cache size is the historical one (equivalent to factor 1.0). If set to; non zero auto cache creation is enabled and both auto created and; default sized caches will use the configured factor: 0.0 no automatic cache; and greater than 0.0 to enable cache. This value can be overridden by the; environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE. The resource variable TTreeCache.Prefill sets the default TTreeCache prefilling; type. The prefill type may be: 0 for no prefilling and 1 to prefill all; the branches. It can be overridden by the environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_PREFILL. In particular the default can be set back to the same as in version 5 by; setting TTreeCache.Size (or ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE) and TTreeCache.Prefill; (or ROOT_TTREECACHE_PREFILL) both to zero. TTree methods which are expected to modify a cache, like AddBranchToCache, will; attempt to setup a cache of default size if one does not exist, irrespective of; whether the auto cache creation is enabled.

For example to add the; entries, with exactly 600 tracks:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw("">>+ myList"",""fNtrack == 600"", ""entrylist"");; ```.

This modularity makes **`TEntryList`** much better; suited for PROOF processing than the **`TEventList`**. #### Using an Event List.

C/C++ front-end specific debug information; ==========================================. The C and C++ front-ends represent information about the program in a; format that is effectively identical to `DWARF <http://www.dwarfstd.org/>`_; in terms of information content. This allows code generators to; trivially support native debuggers by generating standard dwarf; information, and contains enough information for non-dwarf targets to; translate it as needed. This section describes the forms used to represent C and C++ programs. Other; languages could pattern themselves after this (which itself is tuned to; representing programs in the same way that DWARF does), or they could choose; to provide completely different forms if they don't fit into the DWARF model.; As support for debugging information gets added to the various LLVM; source-language front-ends, the information used should be documented here. The following sections provide examples of a few C/C++ constructs and; the debug information that would best describe those constructs. The; canonical references are the ``DINode`` classes defined in; ``include/llvm/IR/DebugInfoMetadata.h`` and the implementations of the; helper functions in ``lib/IR/DIBuilder.cpp``. C/C++ source file information; -----------------------------. ``llvm::Instruction`` provides easy access to metadata attached with an; instruction. One can extract line number information encoded in LLVM IR using; ``Instruction::getDebugLoc()`` and ``DILocation::getLine()``. .. code-block:: c++. if (DILocation *Loc = I->getDebugLoc()) { // Here I is an LLVM instruction; unsigned Line = Loc->getLine();; StringRef ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:40933,tune,tuned,40933,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['tune'],['tuned']
Performance,"of having Cling interpret your script there is a way to have your; scripts compiled, linked and dynamically loaded using the C++ compiler; and linker. The advantage of this is that your scripts will run with the; speed of compiled C++ and that you can use language constructs that are; not fully supported by Cling. On the other hand, you cannot use any Cling; shortcuts (see ""C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting"" above) and for small scripts, the; overhead of the compile/link cycle might be larger than just executing; the script in the interpreter. ACLiC will build a dictionary and a shared library from your C++; script, using the compiler and the compiler options that were used to; compile the ROOT executable. You do not have to write a Makefile; remembering the correct compiler options, and you do not have to exit; ROOT. ### Usage. Before you can compile your interpreted script you need to add include; statements for the classes used in the script. Once you did that, you; can build and load a shared library containing your script. To load it; use the command `.L` and append the file name with a `+`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+; ```. The + option generates the shared library and names it by taking; the name of the file ""filename"" but replacing the dot before the; extension by an underscore and by adding the shared library extension; for the current platform. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx`; will generate `hsimple_cxx.so`. The + command rebuild the library only if the script or any of the; files it includes are newer than the library. When checking the; timestamp, ACLiC generates a dependency file which name is the same as; the library name, just replacing the 'so' extension by the extension; 'd'. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx` will generate; `hsimple_cxx.d`. To ensure that the shared library is rebuilt you can use the ++; syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```.

Performance,"of parentheses) and allow; it to be treated uniformly with valid CallExprs. However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong. This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so dropping the statements is OK). Types and dependence; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``RecoveryExpr`` is an ``Expr``, so it must have a type. In many cases the true; type can't really be known until the code is corrected (e.g. a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved.

Next, ``%{outer}`` expands, and the output of; the ``echo`` command becomes:. .. code-block:: shell. %{inner}. Of course, one way to fix this simple case is to reverse the definitions of; ``%{outer}`` and ``%{inner}``. However, if a test has a complex set of; substitutions that can all reference each other, there might not exist a; sufficient substitution order. To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list. Thus, in; the above example, setting the limit to 2 would cause lit to make a second pass; that expands ``%{inner}`` in the ``RUN:`` line, and the output from the ``echo``; command when then be:. .. code-block:: shell. expanded. To improve performance, lit will stop making passes when it notices the ``RUN:``; line has stopped changing. In the above example, setting the limit higher than; 2 is thus harmless. To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again.

These have the; same format as the source location in the :ref:`identifier structure; <table-ident_t_structure>`, but the function name is replaced with the variable; name. .. _Device Compilation:. Offload Device Compilation; --------------------------. The input file is compiled for each active device toolchain. The device; compilation stage is performed differently from the host stage. Namely, we do; not generate any offloading entries. This is set by passing the; ``-fopenmp-is-target-device`` flag to the front-end. We use the host bitcode to; determine which symbols to export from the device. The bitcode file is passed in; from the previous stage using the ``-fopenmp-host-ir-file-path`` flag.; Compilation is otherwise performed as it would be for any other target triple. When compiling for the OpenMP device, we set the visibility of all device; symbols to be ``protected`` by default. This improves performance and prevents a; class of errors where a symbol in the target device could preempt a host; library. The OpenMP runtime library is linked in during compilation to provide the; implementations for standard OpenMP functionality. For GPU targets this is done; by linking in a special bitcode library during compilation, (e.g.; ``libomptarget-nvptx64-sm_70.bc``) using the ``-mlink-builtin-bitcode`` flag.; Other device libraries, such as CUDA's libdevice, are also linked this way. If; the target is a standard architecture with an existing ``libomp``; implementation, that will be linked instead. Finally, device tools are used to; create a relocatable device object file that can be embedded in the host. .. _Creating Fat Objects:. Creating Fat Objects; --------------------.

This is; effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current; volume.; - in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the; method FindInCluster() is invoked. This method checks all different; possibilities within the cluster of overlapping candidates.

They are allocated either; statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter; values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame; containing the local variables of a function.

In case the distance to next crossed; boundary is required, the current point has to be physically INSIDE the; shape pointed by the current volume. This is only insured in case a call; to `TGeoManager::FindNode()` was performed for the current point.; Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and; direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to; compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved.

The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there. Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations. If you look at the first indices in these GEP instructions you find that they; are different (0 and 1), therefore the address computation diverges with that; index. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: llvm. @MyVar = external global { [10 x i32] }; %idx1 = getelementp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:7047,load,load,7047,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['load'],['load']

The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #. The second operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:20477,optimiz,optimizers,20477,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizers']
Performance,"ol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``. Next the linker invokes the LLVM; optimizer and code generators using ``lto_codegen_compile()`` which returns a; native object file creating by merging the LLVM bitcode files and applying; various optimization passes. Phase 4 : Symbol Resolution after optimization; ----------------------------------------------. In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals.

C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition.

The biggest one containing all others defines the ""world"" of the; model. We will often call this ""master reference system (MARS)"". Going; on and opening our packs, we will obviously find out some empty ones,; otherwise, something is very wrong... We will call these leaves (by; analogy with a tree structure). On the other hand, any volume is a small world by itself - what we need; to do is to take it out and to ignore all the rest since it is a; self-contained object. In fact, the modeller can act like this,; considering a given volume as temporary MARS, but we will describe this; feature later on. Let us focus on the biggest pack - it is mandatory to; define one.

Performance,"oming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form. For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_. The question for this article is ""who places the phi nodes when lowering; assignments to mutable variables?"". The issue here is that LLVM; *requires* that its IR be in SSA form: there is no ""non-ssa"" mode for; it. However, SSA construction requires non-trivial algorithms and data; structures, so it is inconvenient and wasteful for every front-end to; have to reproduce this logic. Memory in LLVM; ==============. The 'trick' here is that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that spa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:3709,load,loads,3709,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['load'],['loads']

The default value for all unspecified reflection parameters is zero. The ``NVVMReflect`` pass should be executed early in the optimization; pipeline, immediately after the link stage. The ``internalize`` pass is also; recommended to remove unused math functions from the resulting PTX. For an; input IR module ``module.bc``, the following compilation flow is recommended:. 1.

This; tutorial runs through the implementation of a JIT compiler using LLVM's; On-Request-Compilation (ORC) APIs. It begins with a simplified version of the; KaleidoscopeJIT class used in the; `Implementing a language with LLVM <LangImpl01.html>`_ tutorials and then; introduces new features like concurrent compilation, optimization, lazy; compilation and remote execution. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to LLVM's ORC JIT APIs, show how; these APIs interact with other parts of LLVM, and to teach you how to recombine; them to build a custom JIT that is suited to your use-case. The structure of the tutorial is:. - Chapter #1: Investigate the simple KaleidoscopeJIT class. This will; introduce some of the basic concepts of the ORC JIT APIs, including the; idea of an ORC *Layer*. - `Chapter #2 <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_: Extend the basic KaleidoscopeJIT by adding; a new layer that will optimize IR and generated code. - `Chapter #3 <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_: Further extend the JIT by adding a; Compile-On-Demand layer to lazily compile IR. - `Chapter #4 <BuildingAJIT4.html>`_: Improve the laziness of our JIT by; replacing the Compile-On-Demand layer with a custom layer that uses the ORC; Compile Callbacks API directly to defer IR-generation until functions are; called. - `Chapter #5 <BuildingAJIT5.html>`_: Add process isolation by JITing code into; a remote process with reduced privileges using the JIT Remote APIs. To provide input for our JIT we will use a lightly modified version of the; Kaleidoscope REPL from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a; language in LLVM tutorial"".

The generated profile; could then be something like this:. .. code-block:: console. main:35504:0; 1: _Z3foov:35504; 2: _Z32bari:31977; 1.1: 31977; 2: 0. This profile indicates that there were a total of 35,504 samples; collected in main. All of those were at line 1 (the call to ``foo``).; Of those, 31,977 were spent inside the body of ``bar``. The last line; of the profile (``2: 0``) corresponds to line 2 inside ``main``. No; samples were collected there. .. _prof_instr:. Profiling with Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clang also supports profiling via instrumentation. This requires building a; special instrumented version of the code and has some runtime; overhead during the profiling, but it provides more detailed results than a; sampling profiler.

Performance,"ompiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint. This prevents the optimizer; from performing unsound optimizations.; #. recording a mapping of live pointers (and the allocation they're; associated with) for each statepoint. At the most abstract level, inserting a safepoint can be thought of as; replacing a call instruction with a call to a multiple return value; function which both calls the original target of the call, returns; its result, and returns updated values for any live pointers to; garbage collected objects.

Performance,"on ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``Mem",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:11241,optimiz,optimized,11241,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

Data-sharing modes; ------------------. Clang supports two data-sharing models for Cuda devices: `Generic` and `Cuda`; modes. The default mode is `Generic`. `Cuda` mode can give an additional; performance and can be activated using the `-fopenmp-cuda-mode` flag. In; `Generic` mode all local variables that can be shared in the parallel regions; are stored in the global memory. In `Cuda` mode local variables are not shared; between the threads and it is user responsibility to share the required data; between the threads in the parallel regions. Often, the optimizer is able to; reduce the cost of `Generic` mode to the level of `Cuda` mode, but the flag,; as well as other assumption flags, can be used for tuning.

Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``. This is useful when compiling with ``-Os`` to; manually enable vectorization or interleaving. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop interleave(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. The vector width is specified by; ``vectorize_width(_value_[, fixed|scalable])``, where _value_ is a positive; integer and the type of vectorization can be specified with an optional; second parameter. The default for the second parameter is 'fixed' and; refers to fixed width vectorization, whereas 'scalable' indicates the; compiler should use scalable vectors instead. Another use of vectorize_width; is ``vectorize_width(fixed|scalable)`` where the user can hint at the type; of vectorization to use without specifying the exact width. In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors.

Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited.

Performance,"on is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language loop iterations are executing concurrently.

The LiveOut section of the StkMapRecord will be empty for a statepoint; record. Safepoint Semantics & Verification; ==================================. The fundamental correctness property for the compiled code's; correctness w.r.t. the garbage collector is a dynamic one. It must be; the case that there is no dynamic trace such that an operation; involving a potentially relocated pointer is observably-after a; safepoint which could relocate it. 'observably-after' is this usage; means that an outside observer could observe this sequence of events; in a way which precludes the operation being performed before the; safepoint. To understand why this 'observable-after' property is required,; consider a null comparison performed on the original copy of a; relocated pointer. Assuming that control flow follows the safepoint,; there is no way to observe externally whether the null comparison is; performed before or after the safepoint. (Remember, the original; Value is unmodified by the safepoint.) The compiler is free to make; either scheduling choice. The actual correctness property implemented is slightly stronger than; this. We require that there be no *static path* on which a; potentially relocated pointer is 'observably-after' it may have been; relocated. This is slightly stronger than is strictly necessary (and; thus may disallow some otherwise valid programs), but greatly; simplifies reasoning about correctness of the compiled code. By construction, this property will be upheld by the optimizer if; correctly established in the source IR. This is a key invariant of; the design. The existing IR Verifier pass has been extended to check most of the; local restrictions on the intrinsics mentioned in their respective; documentation.

Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead).

Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery.

Note that after template substitution, the; resulting assembly string is parsed by LLVM's integrated assembler unless it is; disabled -- even when emitting a ``.s`` file -- and thus must contain assembly; syntax known to LLVM. LLVM also supports a few more substitutions useful for writing inline assembly:. - ``${:uid}``: Expands to a decimal integer unique to this inline assembly blob.; This substitution is useful when declaring a local label. Many standard; compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may duplicate an inline asm blob.; Adding a blob-unique identifier ensures that the two labels will not conflict; during assembly.

Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done.

Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation.

Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class.

Performance,"on the instruction tells the; optimizer that the value loaded is known to be aligned to a boundary specified; by the integer value in the metadata node. The alignment must be a power of 2.; This is analogous to the ''align'' attribute on parameters and return values.; This metadata can only be applied to loads of a pointer type. If the returned; value is not appropriately aligned at runtime, a poison value is returned; instead. The optional ``!noundef`` metadata must reference a single metadata name; ``<empty_node>`` corresponding to a node with no entries. The existence of; ``!noundef`` metadata on the instruction tells the optimizer that the value; loaded is known to be :ref:`well defined <welldefinedvalues>`.; If the value isn't well defined, the behavior is undefined. If the ``!noundef``; metadata is combined with poison-generating metadata like ``!nonnull``,; violation of that metadata constraint will also result in undefined behavior.

If the value being loaded; is of scalar type then the number of bytes read does not exceed the; minimum number of bytes needed to hold all bits of the type. For; example, loading an ``i24`` reads at most three bytes. When loading a; value of a type like ``i20`` with a size that is not an integral number; of bytes, the result is undefined if the value was not originally; written using a store of the same type.; If the value being loaded is of aggregate type, the bytes that correspond to; padding may be accessed but are ignored, because it is impossible to observe; padding from the loaded aggregate value.; If ``<pointer>`` is not a well-defined value, the behavior is undefined.

The easiest way to get started is to clone one of the existing registries; we; recommend ``llvm/CodeGen/RegAllocRegistry.h``. The key things to modify are; the class name and the ``FunctionPassCtor`` type. Then you need to declare the registry. Example: if your pass registry is; ``RegisterMyPasses`` then define:. .. code-block:: c++. MachinePassRegistry<RegisterMyPasses::FunctionPassCtor> RegisterMyPasses::Registry;. And finally, declare the command line option for your passes. Example:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<RegisterMyPasses::FunctionPassCtor, false,; RegisterPassParser<RegisterMyPasses> >; MyPassOpt(""mypass"",; cl::init(&createDefaultMyPass),; cl::desc(""my pass option help""));. Here the command option is ""``mypass``"", with ``createDefaultMyPass`` as the; default creator. Using GDB with dynamically loaded passes; ----------------------------------------. Unfortunately, using GDB with dynamically loaded passes is not as easy as it; should be. First of all, you can't set a breakpoint in a shared object that; has not been loaded yet, and second of all there are problems with inlined; functions in shared objects. Here are some suggestions to debugging your pass; with GDB. For sake of discussion, I'm going to assume that you are debugging a; transformation invoked by :program:`opt`, although nothing described here; depends on that.

Next, we register the analysis passes used by the transform passes. .. code-block:: c++. // Register analysis passes used in these transform passes.; PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerModuleAnalyses(*TheMAM);; PB.registerFunctionAnalyses(*TheFAM);; PB.crossRegisterProxies(*TheLAM, *TheFAM, *TheCGAM, *TheMAM);; }. Once the PassManager is set up, we need to make use of it. We do this by; running it after our newly created function is constructed (in; ``FunctionAST::codegen()``), but before it is returned to the client:. .. code-block:: c++. if (Value *RetVal = Body->codegen()) {; // Finish off the function.; Builder.CreateRet(RetVal);. // Validate the generated code, checking for consistency.; verifyFunction(*TheFunction);. // Optimize the function.; TheFPM->run(*TheFunction, *TheFAM);. return TheFunction;; }. As you can see, this is pretty straightforward. The; ``FunctionPassManager`` optimizes and updates the LLVM Function\* in; place, improving (hopefully) its body. With this in place, we can try; our test above again:. ::. ready> def test(x) (1+2+x)*(x+(1+2));; ready> Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double %x, 3.000000e+00; %multmp = fmul double %addtmp, %addtmp; ret double %multmp; }.

LLVM provides a wide variety of optimizations that can be used in; certain circumstances. Some `documentation about the various; passes <../../Passes.html>`_ is available, but it isn't very complete.; Another good source of ideas can come from looking at the passes that; ``Clang`` runs to get started.

Performance,"on() {;}; virtual ~ATLFMuon() {;}; ClassDef(ATLFMuon,1) //; };; ClassImp(ATLFMuon); #endif; ```. ## Compression and Performance. ROOT uses a compression algorithm based on the well-known `gzip`; algorithm. It supports nine levels of compression. The default for ROOT; is one. The compression level can be set with the method; `TFile::SetCompressionLevel`. The experience with this algorithm shows; that a compression level of 1.3 for raw data files and around two on; most DST files is the optimum. The choice of one for the default is a; compromise between the time it takes to read and write the object vs.; the disk space savings. To specify no compression, set the level to zero. We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. If the I/O operation is increased; by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it; may compress the data by a factor of 10. On the other hand if the time; spend on I/O is large, compression may have a large impact on the; program's performance. The compression factor, i.e. the savings of disk space, varies with the; type of data. A buffer with a same value array is compressed so that the; value is only written once. For example, a track has the mass of a pion; that it is always the same, and the charge of the pion that is either; positive or negative. For 1000 pions, the mass will be written only; once, and the charge only twice (positive and negative). When the data; is sparse, i.e. when there are many zeros, the compression factor is; also high. +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | Compression level | Bytes | Write Time (sec) | Read Time (sec.) |; +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | 0 | 1,004,998 | 4.77 | 0.07 |; +---------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+; | 1 | 438,366 | 6.67 | 0.05 |; +---------------------+------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:92391,perform,performance,92391,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"on-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow call. * DSE: Unordered stores can be DSE'ed like normal stores. Monotonic stores can; be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially; important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger; atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to; MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,; because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with; atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen; ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes.; On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like; ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()`` returns true. The MachineMemOperand for all atomic operations is currently marked as volatile;; this is not correct in the IR sense of volatile, but CodeGen handles anything; marked volatile very conservatively. This should get fixed at some point. One very important property of the atomic operations is that if your backend; supports any inline lock-free atomic operations of a given size, you should; support *ALL* operations of that size in a lock-free manner. When the target implements atomic ``cmpxchg`` or LL/SC instructions (as most do); this is trivial: all the other operations can be implemented on top of those; primitives.

Performance,"on. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in. If we wanted to make a ""static Kaleidoscope compiler"", we would use; exactly the code we have now, except that we would defer running the; optimizer until the entire file has been parsed. In addition to the distinction between function and module passes, passes can be; divided into transform and analysis passes. Transform passes mutate the IR, and; analysis passes compute information that other passes can use. In order to add; a transform pass, all analysis passes it depends upon must be registered in; advance. In order to get per-function optimizations going, we need to set up a; `FunctionPassManager <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html#what-passmanager-doesr>`_ to hold; and organize the LLVM optimizations that we want to run. Once we have; that, we can add a set of optimizations to run.

Before the optimization:. .. code-block:: llvm. define double @fib(double %x) {; entry:; %x1 = alloca double; store double %x, double* %x1; %x2 = load double, double* %x1; %cmptmp = fcmp ult double %x2, 3.000000e+00; %booltmp = uitofp i1 %cmptmp to double; %ifcond = fcmp one double %booltmp, 0.000000e+00; br i1 %ifcond, label %then, label %else. then: ; preds = %entry; br label %ifcont. else: ; preds = %entry; %x3 = load double, double* %x1; %subtmp = fsub double %x3, 1.000000e+00; %calltmp = call double @fib(double %subtmp); %x4 = load double, double* %x1; %subtmp5 = fsub double %x4, 2.000000e+00; %calltmp6 = call double @fib(double %su",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:16680,optimiz,optimizations,16680,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"onDAG framework will; natively support the new node. In this case, you must also add code in your; node's case statement in ``LegalizeOp`` to Expand your node into simpler,; legal operations. The case for ``ISD::UREM`` for expanding a remainder into; a divide, multiply, and a subtract is a good example. #. ``lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/LegalizeDAG.cpp``:. If targets may support the new node being added only at certain sizes, you; will also need to add code to your node's case statement in ``LegalizeOp``; to Promote your node's operands to a larger size, and perform the correct; operation. You will also need to add code to ``PromoteOp`` to do this as; well. For a good example, see ``ISD::BSWAP``, which promotes its operand to; a wider size, performs the byteswap, and then shifts the correct bytes right; to emulate the narrower byteswap in the wider type. #. ``lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/LegalizeDAG.cpp``:. Add a case for your node in ``ExpandOp`` to teach the legalizer how to; perform the action represented by the new node on a value that has been split; into high and low halves. This case will be used to support your node with a; 64 bit operand on a 32 bit target. #. ``lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/DAGCombiner.cpp``:. If your node can be combined with itself, or other existing nodes in a; peephole-like fashion, add a visit function for it, and call that function; from. There are several good examples for simple combines you can do;; ``visitFABS`` and ``visitSRL`` are good starting places. #. ``lib/Target/PowerPC/PPCISelLowering.cpp``:. Each target has an implementation of the ``TargetLowering`` class, usually in; its own file (although some targets include it in the same file as the; DAGToDAGISel). The default behavior for a target is to assume that your new; node is legal for all types that are legal for that target. If this target; does not natively support your node, then tell the target to either Promote; it (if it is supported at a larger type) or Expand it.
