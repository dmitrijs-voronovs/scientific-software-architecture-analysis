The new vectorizing CPU evaluation backend is not the default for RooFit likelihoods.; Likelihood minimization is now up to 10x faster on a single CPU core. If you experience unexpected problems related to the likelihood evaluation, you; can revert back to the old backend by passing `RooFit::EvalBackend(""legacy"")`; to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()` or `RooAbsPdf::createNLL()`. In case you observe any slowdowns with the new likelihood evaluation, please; open a GitHub issue about this, as such a performance regression is considered; a bug. ### Asymptotically correct uncertainties for extended unbinned likelihood fits.

There is also an advantage to using this form of interprocedural mitigation: by; forming these invalid stack pointer addresses we can prevent speculative; returns from successfully reading speculatively written values to the actual; stack. This works first by forming a data-dependency between computing the; address of the return address on the stack and our predicate state. And even; when satisfied, if a misprediction causes the state to be poisoned the; resulting stack pointer will be invalid. ##### Rewrite API of internal functions to directly propagate predicate state. (Not yet implemented.). We have the option with internal functions to directly adjust their API to; accept the predicate as an argument and return it. This is likely to be; marginally cheaper than embedding into `%rsp` for entering functions. ##### Use `lfence` to guard function transitions. An `lfence` instruction can be used to prevent subsequent loads from; speculatively executing until all prior mispredicted predicates have resolved.; We can use this broader barrier to speculative loads executing between; functions. We emit it in the entry block to handle calls, and prior to each; return. This approach also has the advantage of providing the strongest degree; of mitigation when mixed with unmitigated code by halting all misspeculation; entering a function which is mitigated, regardless of what occurred in the; caller. However, such a mixture is inherently more risky. Whether this kind of; mixture is a sufficient mitigation requires careful analysis. Unfortunately, experimental results indicate that the performance overhead of; this approach is very high for certain patterns of code. A classic example is; any form of recursive evaluation engine. The hot, rapid call and return; sequences exhibit dramatic performance loss when mitigated with `lfence`. This; component alone can regress performance by 2x or more, making it an unpleasant; tradeoff",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:41333,load,loads,41333,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']

At that point, they; get removed from the queue and the retire control unit is notified. When instructions are executed, the retire control unit flags the instruction as; ""ready to retire."".

The register file is notified of the; retirement so that it can free the physical registers that were allocated for; the instruction during the register renaming stage. Load/Store Unit and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst:39665,queue,queues,39665,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst,1,['queue'],['queues']

Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction.

It's worth noting that, for historical reasons, this library is; called ``libLLVMCore.so``, not ``libLLVMIR.so`` as you might expect. .. _Type:. The Type class and Derived Types; --------------------------------. ``Type`` is a superclass of all type classes. Every ``Value`` has a ``Type``.; ``Type`` cannot be instantiated directly but only through its subclasses.; Certain primitive types (``VoidType``, ``LabelType``, ``FloatType`` and; ``DoubleType``) have hidden subclasses. They are hidden because they offer no; useful functionality beyond what the ``Type`` class offers except to distinguish; themselves from other subclasses of ``Type``. All other types are subclasses of ``DerivedType``. Types can be named, but this; is not a requirement. There exists exactly one instance of a given shape at any; one time. This allows type equality to be performed with address equality of; the Type Instance. That is, given two ``Type*`` values, the types are identical; if the pointers are identical. .. _m_Type:. Important Public Methods; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. * ``bool isIntegerTy() const``: Returns true for any integer type. * ``bool isFloatingPointTy()``: Return true if this is one of the five; floating point types. * ``bool isSized()``: Return true if the type has known size. Things; that don't have a size are abstract types, labels and void. .. _derivedtypes:. Important Derived Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``IntegerType``; Subclass of DerivedType that represents integer types of any bit width. Any; bit width between ``IntegerType::MIN_INT_BITS`` (1) and; ``IntegerType::MAX_INT_BITS`` (~8 million) can be represented. * ``static const IntegerType* get(unsigned NumBits)``: get an integer; type of a specific bit width. * ``unsigned getBitWidth() const``: Get the bit width of an integer type. ``SequentialType``; This is subclassed by ArrayTy",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:135224,perform,performed,135224,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['perform'],['performed']

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scal",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:27526,load,load,27526,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations.

Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly require a rewrite of the Python code.; Add that Numba, as a JIT-compiler, is fully run-time just like ``cppyy``,; and the use case for integration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.).

Performance,"efgroup roofit_dev_docs_batchcompute RooBatchCompute library guide; \ingroup roofit_dev_docs; \date September 2021; \author Emmanouil Michalainas; \brief Overview of the RooBatchCompute library. ## RooBatchCompute Library; _Contains optimized computation functions for PDFs that enable significantly faster fittings._; #### Note: This library is still at an experimental stage. Tests are being conducted continuously to ensure correctness of the results, but the interfaces and the instructions on how to use might change. ### Purpose; While fitting, a significant amount of time and processing power is spent on computing the probability function for every event and PDF involved in the fitting model. To speed up this process, roofit can use the computation functions provided in this library. The functions provided here process whole data arrays (batches) instead of a single event at a time, as in the legacy evaluate() function in roofit. In addition, the code is written in a manner that allows for compiler optimizations, notably auto-vectorization. This library is compiled multiple times for different [vector instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and the optimal code is executed during runtime, as a result of an automatic hardware detection mechanism that this library contains. **As a result, fits can benefit by a speedup of 3x-16x.**. As of ROOT v6.26, RooBatchComputes also provides multithread and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) instances of the computation functions, resulting in even greater improvements for fitting times. ### How to use; This library is an internal component of RooFit, so users are not supposed to actively interact with it. Instead, they can benefit from significantly faster times for fitting by calling `fitTo()` and providing a `BatchMode(""cpu"")` or a `BatchMode(""cuda"")` option.; ``` {.cpp}; // fit using the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cpu""));. // f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md:1017,optimiz,optimizations,1017,roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"efined mapping to an; integer representation. This semantic quirk allows the runtime to pick a; integer mapping for each point in the program allowing relocations of objects; without visible effects. This high level abstract machine model is used for most of the optimizer. As; a result, transform passes do not need to be extended to look through explicit; relocation sequence. Before starting code generation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described.

The two macros can be used to provide more flexibiilty so a user program; can execute code specifically intended for profile generate or profile use.; For example, a user program can have special logging during profile generate:. .. code-block:: c. #if __LLVM_INSTR_PROFILE_GENERATE; expensive_logging_of_full_program_state();; #endif. The logging is automatically excluded during a normal build of the program,; hence it does not impact performance during a normal execution. It is advised to use such fine tuning only in a program's cold regions. The weak; symbols can introduce extra control flow (the ``if`` checks), while the macros; (hence declarations they guard in ``profile/instr_prof_interface.h``); can change the control flow of the functions that use them between profile; generation and profile use (which can lead to discarded counters in such; functions). Using these APIs in the program's cold regions introduces less; overhead and leads to more optimized code. Disabling Instrumentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In certain situations, it may be useful to disable profile generation or use; for specific files in a build, without affecting the main compilation flags; used for the other files in the project. In these cases, you can use the flag ``-fno-profile-instr-generate`` (or; ``-fno-profile-generate``) to disable profile generation, and; ``-fno-profile-instr-use`` (or ``-fno-profile-use``) to disable profile use. Note that these flags should appear after the corresponding profile; flags to have an effect. .. note::.

Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.store``' intrinsics is designed for conditional writing of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked store and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a load-modify-store sequence. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions and data races on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. call void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> %value, ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1> %mask). ;; The result of the following instructions is identical aside from potential data races and memory access exceptions; %oldval = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %value, <16 x float> %oldval; store <16 x float> %res, ptr %ptr, align 4. Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mgather:.

We turn off llvm_first_trigger() calls with NOPs, but this would hide; phase behavior from us (when some funcs/traces stop being hot and; others become hot.). We have a SIGALRM timer that counts time for us. Every time we get a; SIGALRM we look at our priority queue of locations where we have; removed llvm_first_trigger() calls.

Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code.

Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the `manager class`; at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes; can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed.; Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation; stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes; may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible; once volumes were defined based on it. The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are; performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific; algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note; that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry.; However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:. ~~~ {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; ~~~. The method above returns `kTRUE` if the point \*point is actually inside; the shape. The point has to be defined in the local shape reference. For; instance, for a box having `DX,DY` and `DZ `half-lengths a point will be; considered inside if:. `-DX <= point[0] <= DX`. `-DY <= point[1] <= DY`. `-DZ <= point[2] <= DZ`. ~~~ {.cpp}; Double_t TGeoShape::DistFromInside(Double_t *point[3],; Double_t *dir[3], Int_t iact,Double_t step,Double_t *safe);; ~~~.

Definitions consistency; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C++ language defines that same declarations in different translation units should have; the same definition, as known as ODR (One Definition Rule). Prior to modules, the translation; units don't dependent on each other and the compiler itself can't perform a strong; ODR violation check. With the introduction of modules, now the compiler have; the chance to perform ODR violations with language semantics across translation units. However, in the practice, we found the existing ODR checking mechanism is not stable; enough. Many people suffers from the false positive ODR violation diagnostics, AKA,; the compiler are complaining two identical declarations have different definitions; incorrectly. Also the true positive ODR violations are rarely reported.; Also we learned that MSVC don't perform ODR check for declarations in the global module; fragment. So in order to get better user experience, save the time checking ODR and keep consistent; behavior with MSVC, we disabled the ODR check for the declarations in the global module; fragment by default.

You can read more in the; :ref:`loop terminology section for the LCSSA form <loop-terminology-lcssa>`. .. _passes-licm:. ``licm``: Loop Invariant Code Motion; ------------------------------------. This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory. If there is a store instruction inside of the; loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of inside of; the loop. This can only happen if a few conditions are true:. #. The pointer stored through is loop invariant.; #. There are no stores or loads in the loop which *may* alias the pointer.; There are no calls in the loop which mod/ref the pointer. If these conditions are true, we can promote the loads and stores in the; loop of the pointer to use a temporary alloca'd variable.

As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations. Eliminating these restrictions and limitations was one of the primary motivations; for the development of JITLink. The llvm-jitlink tool; =====================. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is a command line wrapper for the JITLink library.; It loads some set of relocatable object files and then links them using; JITLink. Depending on the options used it will then execute them, or validate; the linked memory. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool was originally designed to aid JITLink development by; providing a simple environment for testing. Basic usage; -----------. By default, ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the set of objects passed on the command; line, then search for a ""main"" function and execute it:. .. code-block:: sh. % cat hello-world.c; #include <stdio.h>. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; printf(""hello, world!\n"");; return 0;; }. % clang -c -o hello-world.o hello-world.c; % llvm-jitlink hello-world.o; Hello, World!.

That means you can not redefine function in your Kaleidoscope as its shown below. Just skip this part. The reason is that the newer OrcV2 JIT APIs are trying to stay very close to the static and dynamic linker rules, including rejecting duplicate symbols.

Non-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations. Specifically, care must be taken when trying to use ``MemorySSA``; to reason about atomic or volatile operations, as in:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @foo(ptr %a) {; entry:; br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.end. if.then:; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); %0 = load volatile i8, ptr %a; br label %if.end. if.end:; %av = phi i8 [0, %entry], [%0, %if.then]; ret i8 %av; }.

Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not mean A noalias C), so it is not possible to; come up with a precise partitioning in all cases without variables to; represent every pair of possible aliases.

You should describe a concrete target-specific class that represents the; register file of a target machine. This class is called ``XXXRegisterInfo``; (where ``XXX`` identifies the target) and represents the class register file; data that is used for register allocation. It also describes the interactions; between registers. You also need to define register classes to categorize related registers. A; register class should be added for groups of registers that are all treated the; same way for some instruction. Typical examples are register classes for; integer, floating-point, or vector registers. A register allocator allows an; instruction to use any register in a specified register class to perform the; instruction in a similar manner. Register classes allocate virtual registers; to instructions from these sets, and register classes let the; target-independent register allocator automatically choose the actual; registers. Much of the code for registers, including register definition, register; aliases, and register classes, is generated by TableGen from; ``XXXRegisterInfo.td`` input files and placed in ``XXXGenRegisterInfo.h.inc``; and ``XXXGenRegisterInfo.inc`` output files.

Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load). These operations effective map to ""if (cond.i) a[j++] = v.i"" and ""if (cond.i) v.i = a[j++]"" patterns, respectively.

In particular, it can efficiently store polymorphic objects,; the traits class is informed when an element is inserted or removed from the; list, and ``ilist``\ s are guaranteed to support a constant-time splice; operation. An ``ilist`` and an ``iplist`` are ``using`` aliases to one another and the; latter only currently exists for historical purposes. These properties are exactly what we want for things like ``Instruction``\ s and; basic blocks, which is why these are implemented with ``ilist``\ s.

Performance,"ementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped.

On ARM (before v8), MIPS, and many other RISC architectures, Acquire, Release,; and SequentiallyConsistent semantics require barrier instructions for every such; operation.

It is often easiest for backends to use AtomicExpandPass to lower some of the; atomic constructs. Here are some lowerings it can do:. * cmpxchg -> loop with load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR()``, ``emitLoadLinked()``,; ``emitStoreConditional()``; * large loads/stores -> ll-sc/cmpxchg; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicStoreInIR()``/``shouldExpandAtomicLoadInIR()``; * strong atomic accesses -> monotonic accesses + fences by overriding; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()``, ``emitLeadingFence()``, and; ``emitTrailingFence()``; * atomic rmw -> loop with cmpxchg or load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``expandAtomicRMWInIR()``; * expansion to __atomic_* libcalls for unsupported sizes.; * part-word atomicrmw/cmpxchg -> target-specific intrinsic by overriding; ``shouldExpandAtomicRMWInIR``, ``emitMaskedAtomicRMWIntrinsic``,; ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR``, and ``emitMaskedAtomicCmpXchgIntrinsic``.

Performance,"enerating the PCH file initially is not so large that it; counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to eliminating the; need to parse the bundled headers in the first place. This is particularly; important on multi-core systems, because PCH file generation serializes the; build when all compilations require the PCH file to be up-to-date. Modules, as implemented in Clang, use the same mechanisms as precompiled; headers to save a serialized AST file (one per module) and use those AST; modules. From an implementation standpoint, modules are a generalization of; precompiled headers, lifting a number of restrictions placed on precompiled; headers. In particular, there can only be one precompiled header and it must; be included at the beginning of the translation unit. The extensions to the; AST file format required for modules are discussed in the section on; :ref:`modules <pchinternals-modules>`. Clang's AST files are designed with a compact on-disk representation, which; minimizes both creation time and the time required to initially load the AST; file. The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored.

Performance,"enseMap that you should be aware of, however.; The iterators in a DenseMap are invalidated whenever an insertion occurs,; unlike map. Also, because DenseMap allocates space for a large number of; key/value pairs (it starts with 64 by default), it will waste a lot of space if; your keys or values are large. Finally, you must implement a partial; specialization of DenseMapInfo for the key that you want, if it isn't already; supported. This is required to tell DenseMap about two special marker values; (which can never be inserted into the map) that it needs internally. DenseMap's find_as() method supports lookup operations using an alternate key; type. This is useful in cases where the normal key type is expensive to; construct, but cheap to compare against. The DenseMapInfo is responsible for; defining the appropriate comparison and hashing methods for each alternate key; type used.

Performance,"ent expression. .. _pchinternals-ident-table:. Identifier Table Block; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The identifier table block contains an on-disk hash table that maps each; identifier mentioned within the AST file to the serialized representation of; the identifier's information (e.g, the ``IdentifierInfo`` structure). The; serialized representation contains:. * The actual identifier string.; * Flags that describe whether this identifier is the name of a built-in, a; poisoned identifier, an extension token, or a macro.; * If the identifier names a macro, the offset of the macro definition within; the :ref:`pchinternals-preprocessor`.; * If the identifier names one or more declarations visible from translation; unit scope, the :ref:`declaration IDs <pchinternals-decls>` of these; declarations. When an AST file is loaded, the AST file reader mechanism introduces itself; into the identifier table as an external lookup source. Thus, when the user; program refers to an identifier that has not yet been seen, Clang will perform; a lookup into the identifier table. If an identifier is found, its contents; (macro definitions, flags, top-level declarations, etc.) will be deserialized,; at which point the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo`` structure will have the; same contents it would have after parsing the headers in the AST file. Within the AST file, the identifiers used to name declarations are represented; with an integral value. A separate table provides a mapping from this integral; value (the identifier ID) to the location within the on-disk hash table where; that identifier is stored. This mapping is used when deserializing the name of; a declaration, the identifier of a token, or any other construct in the AST; file that refers to a name. .. _pchinternals-method-pool:.

Performance,"ent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process.

If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins.

Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached. The analysis manager only provides analysis results for the same IR type as; what the pass runs on. For example, a function pass receives an analysis; manager that only provides function-level analyses. This works for many; passes which work on a fixed scope. However, some passes want to peek up or; down the IR hierarchy. For example, an SCC pass may want to look at function; analyses for the functions inside the SCC. Or it may want to look",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:6958,cache,cache,6958,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

Here; is a testcase:. ::. extern foo(a); # ok, defines foo.; def foo(b) b; # Error: Unknown variable name. (decl using 'a' takes precedence). Driver Changes and Closing Thoughts; ===================================. For now, code generation to LLVM doesn't really get us much, except that; we can look at the pretty IR calls. The sample code inserts calls to; codegen into the ""``HandleDefinition``"", ""``HandleExtern``"" etc; functions, and then dumps out the LLVM IR. This gives a nice way to look; at the LLVM IR for simple functions. For example:. ::. ready> 4+5;; Read top-level expression:; define double @0() {; entry:; ret double 9.000000e+00; }. Note how the parser turns the top-level expression into anonymous; functions for us. This will be handy when we add `JIT; support <LangImpl04.html#adding-a-jit-compiler>`_ in the next chapter. Also note that the; code is very literally transcribed, no optimizations are being performed; except simple constant folding done by IRBuilder. We will `add; optimizations <LangImpl04.html#trivial-constant-folding>`_ explicitly in the next; chapter. ::. ready> def foo(a b) a*a + 2*a*b + b*b;; Read function definition:; define double @foo(double %a, double %b) {; entry:; %multmp = fmul double %a, %a; %multmp1 = fmul double 2.000000e+00, %a; %multmp2 = fmul double %multmp1, %b; %addtmp = fadd double %multmp, %multmp2; %multmp3 = fmul double %b, %b; %addtmp4 = fadd double %addtmp, %multmp3; ret double %addtmp4; }. This shows some simple arithmetic. Notice the striking similarity to the; LLVM builder calls that we use to create the instructions. ::. ready> def bar(a) foo(a, 4.0) + bar(31337);; Read function definition:; define double @bar(double %a) {; entry:; %calltmp = call double @foo(double %a, double 4.000000e+00); %calltmp1 = call double @bar(double 3.133700e+04); %addtmp = fadd double %calltmp, %calltmp1; ret double %addtmp; }.

The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.takeError();. // Add the module.; if (auto Err = JIT->addIRModule(TheadSafeModule(std::move(M), Ctx))); return Err;. // Look up the JIT'd code entry point.; auto EntrySym = JIT->lookup(""entry"");; if (!EntrySym); return EntrySym.takeError();. // Cast the entry point address to a function pointer.; auto *Entry = EntrySym.getAddress().toPtr<void(*)()>();. // Call into JIT'd code.; Entry();. The builder classes provide a number of configuration options that can be; specified before the JIT instance is constructed.

We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

Interested readers may read that chapter for details, but; in short: to optimize a Module we create an llvm::FunctionPassManager; instance, configure it with a set of optimizations, then run the PassManager on; a Module to mutate it into a (hopefully) more optimized but semantically; equivalent form. In the original tutorial series the FunctionPassManager was; created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules were optimized before being; added to it. In this Chapter we will make optimization a phase of our JIT; instead. For now this will provide us a motivation to learn more about ORC; layers, but in the long term making optimization part of our JIT will yield an; important benefit: When we begin lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring; compilation of each function until the first time it's run) having; optimization managed by our JIT will allow us to optimize lazily too, rather; than having to do all our optimization up-front.

Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached.

Performance,"er systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in. If we wanted to make a ""static Kaleidoscope compiler"", we would use; exactly the code we have now, except that we would defer running the; optimizer until the entire file has been parsed. In addition to the distinction between function and module passes, passes can be; divided into transform and analysis passes.

If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instructions in the code. Every virtual that has; been mapped to a stack slot will be stored to memory after being defined and will; be loaded before being used. The implementation of the spiller tries to recycle; load/store instructions, avoiding unnecessary instructions. For an example of; how to invoke the spiller, see ``RegAllocLinearScan::runOnMachineFunction`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/RegAllocLinearScan.cpp``. Handling two address instructions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. With very rare exceptions (e.g., function calls), the LLVM machine code; instructions are three address instructions. That is, each instruction is; expected to define at most one register, and to use at most two registers.; However, some architectures use two address instructions. In this case, the; defined register is also one of the used registers. For instance, an instruction; such as ``ADD %EAX, %EBX``, in X86 is actually equivalent to ``%EAX = %EAX +; %EBX``. In order to produce correct code, LLVM must convert three address instructions; that represent two address instructions into true two address instructions.

However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store.

We are proposing a comprehensive; mitigation approach that would apply automatically across an entire program; rather than through manual changes to the code.

Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is **2x**. How to build; ============. Build LLVM/Clang with `CMake <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>` and enable; the ``compiler-rt`` runtime. An example CMake configuration that will allow; for the use/testing of AddressSanitizer:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=""compiler-rt"" <path to source>/llvm. Usage; =====. Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=address`` flag. The; AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, so; make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step. When linking; shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked, so; ``-Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer). To; get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher. To get nicer stack traces; in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect stack traces; you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail call elimination; (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``). .. code-block:: console. % cat example_UseAfterFree.cc; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; int *array = new int[100];; delete [] array;; return array[argc]; // BOOM; }. # Compile and link; % clang++ -O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer example_UseAfterFree.cc. or:. .. code-block:: console. # Compile; % clang++ -O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -c example_UseAfterFree.cc; # Link; % clang++ -g -fsanitize=address example_UseAfterFree.o. If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and; exit with a non-zero exit code. AddressSanitizer exits on the first detected error.; This is by design:. * This approach allows AddressSanitizer to produce faster and smaller generated code; (both by ~5%).;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst:1607,perform,performance,1607,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"erage Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions. Bottleneck Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; The ``-bottleneck-analysis`` command line option enables the analysis of; performance bottlenecks. This analysis is potentially expensive.

It is possible to perform the one-dimensional minimization/maximization of a function by using directly the function class in ROOT, `TF1` of the *Hist* library.; The minmization is implemented in `TF1` using the BrentMInimizer1D and available with the class member functions; * `TF1::GetMinimum`/`TF1::GetMaximum` to find the function minimum/maximum value; * `TF1::GetMinimumX`/`TF1::GetMaximumX` to find the x value corresponding at the function minimum.

All the algorithms for multi-dimensional minimization are implementing the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer`; interface and they can be used in the same way and one can switch between minimizer at run-time.; The minimizer concrete class can be in different ROOT libraries and they can be instantiate using the ROOT; plug-in manager.; More information on multi-dimensional minimization is provided in the Fit",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:65846,perform,perform,65846,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"erations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow call. * DSE: Unordered stores can be DSE'ed like normal stores. Monotonic stores can; be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially; important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger; atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to; MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,; because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with; atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen; ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes.; On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like; ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()`` returns true. The MachineMemOperand for all atomic operations is currently marked as volatile;; this is not correct in the IR sense of volatile, but CodeGen handles anything; marked volatile very conservatively. This should get fixed at some point. One very important property of the atomic operations is that if your backend; supports any inline lock-free atomic operations of a given size, you should; support *ALL* operations of that size in a lock-free manner.

More precisely, the behavior is as-if any memory written through the; pointer during the execution of the function is overwritten with a poison; value on unwind.

Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, and the size rounded up.

Performance,"erializing an; Objective-C method declaration (or other Objective-C construct) that refers to; the selector. AST Reader Integration Points; -----------------------------. The ""lazy"" deserialization behavior of AST files requires their integration; into several completely different submodules of Clang. For example, lazily; deserializing the declarations during name lookup requires that the name-lookup; routines be able to query the AST file to find entities stored there. For each Clang data structure that requires direct interaction with the AST; reader logic, there is an abstract class that provides the interface between; the two modules. The ``ASTReader`` class, which handles the loading of an AST; file, inherits from all of these abstract classes to provide lazy; deserialization of Clang's data structures. ``ASTReader`` implements the; following abstract classes:. ``ExternalSLocEntrySource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``SourceManager`` class, and; is used whenever the :ref:`source manager <pchinternals-sourcemgr>` needs to; load the details of a file, buffer, or macro instantiation. ``IdentifierInfoLookup``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``IdentifierTable`` class, and; is used whenever the program source refers to an identifier that has not yet; been seen. In this case, the AST reader searches for this identifier within; its :ref:`identifier table <pchinternals-ident-table>` to load any top-level; declarations or macros associated with that identifier. ``ExternalASTSource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``ASTContext`` class, and is; used whenever the abstract syntax tree nodes need to loaded from the AST; file. It provides the ability to de-serialize declarations and types; identified by their numeric values, read the bodies of functions when; required, and read the declarations stored within a declaration context; (either for iteration or for name lookup). ``ExternalSemaSource``; This abstract interface is a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:22394,load,load,22394,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['load'],['load']

A cost model is therefore employed to identify the; best alternative, including the alternative of avoiding any transformation; altogether. The Vectorization Plan is an explicit model for describing vectorization; candidates. It serves for both optimizing candidates including estimating their; cost reliably, and for performing their final translation into IR. This; facilitates dealing with multiple vectorization candidates. High-level Design; =================. Vectorization Workflow; ----------------------; VPlan-based vectorization involves three major steps, taking a ""scenario-based; approach"" to vectorization planning:. 1. Legal Step: check if a loop can be legally vectorized; encode constraints and; artifacts if so.; 2. Plan Step:. a. Build initial VPlans following the constraints and decisions taken by; Legal Step 1, and compute their cost.; b. Apply optimizations to the VPlans, possibly forking additional VPlans.; Prune sub-optimal VPlans having relatively high cost.; 3. Execute Step: materialize the best VPlan. Note that this is the only step; that modifies the IR. Design Guidelines; -----------------; In what follows, the term ""input IR"" refers to code that is fed into the; vectorizer whereas the term ""output IR"" refers to code that is generated by the; vectorizer. The output IR contains code that has been vectorized or ""widened""; according to a loop Vectorization Factor (VF), and/or loop unroll-and-jammed; according to an Unroll Factor (UF).; The design of VPlan follows several high-level guidelines:. 1. Analysis-like: building and manipulating VPlans must not modify the input IR.; In particular, if the best option is not to vectorize at all, the; vectorization process terminates before reaching Step 3, and compilation; should proceed as if VPlans had not been built. 2.

Performance,"erpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack ma",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:18150,load,load,18150,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['load'],['load']

We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant.

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost.

Bitconverts; -----------. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastfail.png; :align: right. The main problem with the ``LD1`` solution is dealing with bitconverts (or bitcasts, or reinterpret casts). These are pseudo instructions that only change the compiler's interpretation of data, not the underlying data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again (called a ""round trip""), the memory contents should be the same after the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y. This would produce a code sequence such as that in the figure on the right. The mismatched ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` cause the stored data to differ from the loaded data. .. container:: clearer.

Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to change the representation to be as if it had been loaded by an ``LD1`` of type ``Y``.

The main difference is that; ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` will load the BMI eagerly, whereas; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will only load the BMI lazily, which is similar; with ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.

Imagine that the SUB32rr were moved forward to give us the following MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6. In this circumstance LLVM would leave the MIR as shown above. Were we to move; the DBG_VALUE of virtual register %7 upwards with the SUB32rr, we would re-order; assignments and introduce a new state of the program. Whereas with the solution; above, the debugger will see one fewer combination of variable values, because; ``!3`` and ``!5`` will change value at the same time. This is preferred over; misrepresenting the original program. In comparison, if one sunk the MOV32rm, LLVM would produce the following:. .. code-block:: text. DBG_VALUE $noreg, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, de",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:33954,load,load,33954,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"es a list of; passes, ensures their :ref:`prerequisites <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>`; are set up correctly, and then schedules passes to run efficiently. All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together. This means that, given a series; of consecutive :ref:`FunctionPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>`, it; will execute all of the :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the first function, then all of the; :ref:`FunctionPasses <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the second; function, etc... until the entire program has been run through the passes. This improves the cache behavior of the compiler, because it is only; touching the LLVM program representation for a single function at a time,; instead of traversing the entire program. It reduces the memory consumption; of compiler, because, for example, only one `DominatorSet; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1DominatorSet.html>`_ needs to be; calculated at a time. The effectiveness of the ``PassManager`` is influenced directly by how much; information it has about the behaviors of the passes it is scheduling.

Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations.

What performs better, run-time or compile-time?; The obvious answer is compile-time: see the performance differences between; C++ and Python, for example.; Obvious, but completely wrong, however.; In fact, when it comes to Python, it is even the `wrong question.`. Everything in Python is run-time: modules, classes, functions, etc. are all; run-time constructs.; A Python module that defines a class is a set of instructions to the Python; interpreter that lead to the construction of the desired class object.; A C/C++ extension module that defines a class does the same thing by calling; a succession of Python interpreter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs;; the exact same that Python uses itself internally).; If you use a compile-time binder such as `SWIG`_ or `pybind11`_ to bind a C++; class, then what gets compiled is the series of API calls necessary to; construct a Python-side equivalent at `run-time` (when the module gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:1583,load,loaded,1583,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['load'],['loaded']
Performance,"es are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model. By default, global initializers are optimized by assuming that global; variables defined within the module are not modified from their; initial values before the start of the global initializer. This is; true even for variables potentially accessible from outside the; module, including those with external linkage or appearing in; ``@llvm.used`` or dllexported variables. This assumption may be suppressed; by marking the variable with ``externally_initialized``. An explicit alignment may be specified for a global, which must be a; power of 2. If not present, or if the alignment is set to zero, the; alignment of the global is set by the target to whatever it feels; convenient. If an explicit alignment is specified, the global is forced; to have exactly that alignment. Targets and optimizers are not allowed; to over-align the global if the global has an assigned section. In this; case, the extra alignment could be observable: for example, code could; assume that the globals are densely packed in their section and try to; iterate over them as an array, alignment padding would break this; iteration. For TLS variables, the module flag ``MaxTLSAlign``, if present,; limits the alignment to the given value. Optimizers are not allowed to; impose a stronger alignment on these variables. The maximum alignment; is ``1 << 32``. For global variable declarations, as well as definitions that may be; replaced at link time (``linkonce``, ``weak``, ``extern_weak`` and ``common``; linkage types), the allocation size and alignment of the definition it resolves; to must be greater than or equal to that of the declaration or replaceable; definition, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

Performance,"es. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as; MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also; causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by; ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent); and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache; invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

Performance,"escribed in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample C",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:1677,optimiz,optimize,1677,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']
Performance,"esponding to the object being called (i.e., the ""receiver"" in Objective-C; parlance), which ExprEngine uses to decide whether or not the call should be; inlined. Inlining Dynamic Calls; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The -analyzer-config ipa option has five different modes: none, basic-inlining,; inlining, dynamic, and dynamic-bifurcate. Under -analyzer-config ipa=dynamic,; all dynamic calls are inlined, whether we are certain or not that this will; actually be the definition used at runtime. Under -analyzer-config ipa=inlining,; only ""near-perfect"" devirtualized calls are inlined*, and other dynamic calls; are evaluated conservatively (as if no definition were available). * Currently, no Objective-C messages are not inlined under; -analyzer-config ipa=inlining, even if we are reasonably confident of the type; of the receiver. We plan to enable this once we have tested our heuristics; more thoroughly. The last option, -analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate, behaves similarly to; ""dynamic"", but performs a conservative invalidation in the general virtual case; in *addition* to inlining. The details of this are discussed below. As stated above, -analyzer-config ipa=basic-inlining does not inline any C++; member functions or Objective-C method calls, even if they are non-virtual or; can be safely devirtualized. Bifurcation; ^^^^^^^^^^^. ExprEngine::BifurcateCall implements the ``-analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate``; mode. When a call is made on an object with imprecise dynamic type information; (RuntimeDefinition::mayHaveOtherDefinitions() evaluates to TRUE), ExprEngine; bifurcates the path and marks the object's region (retrieved from the; RuntimeDefinition object) with a path-sensitive ""mode"" in the ProgramState.

Performance,"esponds to a developers’ intuitions, allowing them to make changes in; their code, and to see the result of these changes without interrupting the; running program. Interactive programming gives programmers the freedom to; explore different scenarios while developing software, writing one expression; at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step, and enabling them to; quickly identify and fix bugs whenever they arise. As an example, the; High-Energy Physics community includes professionals with a variety of; backgrounds, including physicists, nuclear engineers, and software; engineers. Cling allows for interactive data analysis in `ROOT; <https://root.cern/>`_ by giving researchers a way to prototype their C++ code,; allowing them to tailor it to the particular scope of the analysis they want to; pursue on a particular set of data before being added to the main framework. **Interpreted language** is a way to achieve interactive programming. In; statically compiled language, all source code is converted into native machine; code and then executed by the processor before being run. An interpreted; language instead runs through source programs line by line, taking an; executable segment of source code, turning it into machine code, and then; executing it. With this approach, when a change is made by the programmer, the; interpreter will convey it without the need for the entire source code to be; manually compiled. Interpreted languages are flexible, and offer features like; dynamic typing and smaller program size. **Cling** is not an interpreter, it is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that feels; like an interpreter, and allows C++, a language designed to be compiled, to be; interpreted.

Performance,"ess of an aggregate argument that is being passed by; value through memory. Primarily, this feature is required for; compatibility with the Microsoft C++ ABI. Under that ABI, class; instances that are passed by value are constructed directly into; argument stack memory. Prior to the addition of inalloca, calls in LLVM; were indivisible instructions. There was no way to perform intermediate; work, such as object construction, between the first stack adjustment; and the final control transfer. With inalloca, all arguments passed in; memory are modelled as a single alloca, which can be stored to prior to; the call. Unfortunately, this complicated feature comes with a large; set of restrictions designed to bound the lifetime of the argument; memory around the call. For now, it is recommended that frontends and optimizers avoid producing; this construct, primarily because it forces the use of a base pointer.; This feature may grow in the future to allow general mid-level; optimization, but for now, it should be regarded as less efficient than; passing by value with a copy.

Low precision float types; --------------------------; RNTuple supports encoding floating point types with a lower precision when writing them to disk. This encoding is specified by the; user per field and it is independent on the in-memory type used for that field (meaning both a `RField<double>` or `RField<float>` can; be mapped to e.g. a low-precision 16 bit float). RNTuple supports the following encodings (all mutually exclusive):. - **Real16**/**SplitReal16**: IEEE-754 half precision float.

Except for `ROOT v3.10`, the algorithms are all based on an; `LU `factorization followed by forward/back-substitution. `ROOT v3.10`; is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy; of the `CLHEP` routine is poor:. - up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded.; For instance, calculating `U=H*H-1`, where `H` is a (5x5) Hilbert; matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of $10^{-7}$ instead of the $10^{-13}$; using an `LU `according to `Crout`. - scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a; consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for `sizes>(12x12)` fails. In; order to gain speed the `CLHEP` algorithm stores its permutation info of; the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not; possible. `GSL` uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of `Crout`.; Therefore, its accuracy is not as good. For instance a (10x10) Hilbert; matrix has errors 10 times larger than the `LU Crout` result. In; `ROOT v4.0`, the user can choose between the `Invert()` and; `IvertFast()` routines, where the latter is using the Cramer algorithm; for `sizes<7x7`. The speed graph shows the result for `InvertFast()`. 3. `A*x=b` the execution time is measured for solving the linear; equation `A*x=b`. The same factorizations are used as in the matrix; inversion. However, only 1 forward/back-substitution has to be used; instead of msize as in the inversion of (msize x msize) matrix. As a; consequence the same differences are observed but less amplified.

Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass.

Performance,"etry, or it may simply happen that they really represent a; single object, too complex to be described by a primitive shape. Usually handling structures like these can be easily done by positioning; all components in the same container volume, then positioning the; container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining; such a container is not straightforward or even possible without; generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways; out of this:. - Defining the container for the structure as ""overlapping"" (see also; ""Overlapping Volumes""); - Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union; of all components (see also ""Composite Shapes""); - Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the; navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the; number of components in the structure. The best solution is the third; one because it uses all volume-related navigation optimizations. The; class TGeoVolumeAssembly represents an assembly volume. Its shape; is represented by TGeoShapeAssembly class that is the union of all; components. It uses volume voxelization to perform navigation tasks. An assembly volume creates a hierarchical level and it geometrically; insulates the structure from the rest (as a normal volume). Physically,; a point that is INSIDE a TGeoShapeAssembly is always inside one of; the components, so a TGeoVolumeAssembly does not need to have a; medium. Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very; practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible; overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating; honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using; assemblies can be found at: assembly.C. Creation of an assembly is very easy: one has just to create a; TGeoVolumeAssembly object and position the components inside as; for any volume:. ~~~{.cpp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md:49603,optimiz,optimizations,49603,geom/geom/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro9.C; ```. Your present knowledge of ROOT should be enough to understand all the; technicalities behind the macro. Note that the variable `pull` in line; *61* is different from the definition above: instead of the parameter; error on `mean`, the fitted standard deviation of the distribution; divided by the square root of the number of entries,; `sig/sqrt(n_tot_entries)`, is used. - What method exhibits the better performance with the default; parameters ?. - What happens if you increase the number of entries per histogram by; a factor of ten ?

The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; `.rootrc` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related; to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used, to the; location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a `.rootrc` file; in the following order:. - `./.rootrc //local directory`. - `$HOME/.rootrc //user directory`. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory`. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing; and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class `TEnv`.; Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced; features. The file `.rootrc` defines the location of two rather; important files inspected at start-up: `rootalias.C` and `rootlogon.C`.; They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT; startup. `rootalias.C` is only loaded and best used to define some often; used functions. `rootlogon.C` contains code that will be executed at; startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom; style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by; creating a new `TStyle` object with your preferred settings, as; described in the class reference guide, and then use the command; `gROOT->SetStyle(""MyStyleName"");` to make this new style definition the; default one. As an example, have a look in the file `rootlogon.C` coming; with this tutorial. Another relevant file is `rootlogoff.C` that it; called when the session is finished. ### ROOT command history ###.

Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be. Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions. ARC may assume that any retainable object pointers it receives or; generates are instantaneously valid from that point until a point; which, by the concurrency model of the host language, happens-after; the generation of the pointer and happens-before a release of that; object (possibly via an aliasing pointer or indirectly due to; destruction of a different object). .. admonition:: Rationale. There is very little point in trying to guarantee correctness in the; presence of race conditions.

Kernel Dispatch; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory interface; that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent independent; way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using an HSA; compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`), in which AQL packets (all of which; are 64 bytes) can be placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3.

Performance,"ew algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself.

This pass can be used an utility function by a language frontend that doesn't; want to manually reason about liveness, base pointers, or relocation when; constructing IR. As currently implemented, RewriteStatepointsForGC must be; run after SSA construction (i.e. mem2ref).

It will do so by duplicating code as needed to; propagate the base pointer associated with each pointer being relocated to; the appropriate safepoints. The implementation assumes that the following; IR constructs produce base pointers: loads from the heap, addresses of global; variables, function arguments, function return values. Constant pointers (such; as null) are also assumed to be base pointers. In practice, this constraint; can be relaxed to producing interior derived pointers provided the target; collector can find the associated allocation from an arbitrary interior; derived pointer.

Regardless of why, it is useful to detect these situations so; that the optimizer can make more useful decisions about the code.

The MisExpect checks in the LLVM backend follow a simple procedure: if there is; a mismatch between the branch weights collected during profiling and those; supplied by an ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic, then it will emit a diagnostic; message to the user.

How to specify the dependent BMIs; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. There are 3 methods to specify the dependent BMIs:. * (1) ``-fprebuilt-module-path=<path/to/directory>``.; * (2) ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` (Deprecated).; * (3) ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>``. The option ``-fprebuilt-module-path`` tells the compiler the path where to search for dependent BMIs.; It may be used multiple times just like ``-I`` for specifying paths for header files. The look up rule here is:. * (1) When we import module M. The compiler would look up M.pcm in the directories specified; by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.; * (2) When we import partition module unit M:P. The compiler would look up M-P.pcm in the; directories specified by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``. The option ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI directly.; The option ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI; for the module specified by ``<module-name>`` when necessary. The main difference is that; ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` will load the BMI eagerly, whereas; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will only load the BMI lazily, which is similar; with ``-fprebuilt-module-path``. The option ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` for named modules is deprecated; and is planning to be removed in future versions. In case all ``-fprebuilt-module-path=<path/to/directory>``, ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` and; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` exist, the ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` option; takes highest precedence and ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will take the second; highest precedence.

Example: `bb.42.myblock` in MIR references the IR block; `myblock`. It is usually possible to drop the `.myblock` reference and simply; use `bb.42`. - If there are no memory operands or blocks referencing the IR then the; IR function can be replaced by a parameterless dummy function like; `define @func() { ret void }`. - It is possible to drop the whole IR section of the MIR file if it only; contains dummy functions (see above).

Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be. Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions. ARC may assume that any retainable object pointers it receives or; generates are instantaneously valid from that point until a point; which, by the concurrency model of the host language, happens-after; the generation of the pointer and happens-before a release of that; object (possibly via an aliasing pointer or indirectly due to; destruction of a different object). .. admonition:: Rationale.

If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef.

(The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior.

Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute.

Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not.

The instruction can also; be used to calculate a vector of such addresses. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first argument is always a type used as the basis for the calculations.; The second argument is always a pointer or a vector of pointers, and is the; base address to start from. The remaining arguments are indices; that indicate which of the elements of the aggregate object are indexed.; The interpretation of each index is dependent on the type being indexed; into. The first index always indexes the pointer value given as the; second argument, the second index indexes a value of the type pointed to; (not necessarily the value directly pointed to, since the first index; can be non-zero), etc. The first type indexed into must be a pointer; value, subsequent types can be arrays, vectors, and structs. Note that; subsequent types being indexed into can never be pointers, since that; would require loading the pointer before continuing calculation. The type of each index argument depends on the type it is indexing into.; When indexing into a (optionally packed) structure, only ``i32`` integer; **constants** are allowed (when using a vector of indices they must all; be the **same** ``i32`` integer constant). When indexing into an array,; pointer or vector, integers of any width are allowed, and they are not; required to be constant. These integers are treated as signed values; where relevant.

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:20352,perform,performing,20352,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,1,['perform'],['performing']

Note that this only defines the; semantics of the operation; it doesn't mean that targets will emit more; than one instruction to read the series of bytes. Note that in cases where none of the atomic intrinsics are used, this; model places only one restriction on IR transformations on top of what; is required for single-threaded execution: introducing a store to a byte; which might not otherwise be stored is not allowed in general.; (Specifically, in the case where another thread might write to and read; from an address, introducing a store can change a load that may see; exactly one write into a load that may see multiple writes.). .. _ordering:.

RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext helps traverse the compute graph received from RooFit and; then it translates that into a single piece of code (a C++ function), that can; then be differentiated using Clad. It also helps evaluate the model. In RooFit, evaluation is done using the 'evaluate()' function.

Debugging; ---------. One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png. The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG. This can prevent some optimizations as GlobalISel is generally able to work on a; single function at a time. This technique can be repeated for different; combinations of basic blocks until you have identified the critical blocks; involved in a bug. Once the critical blocks have been identified, you can further increase the; resolution to the critical instructions by splitting the blocks like from:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; ... instructions group 2 ... into:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; br %bb2. bb2:; ... instructions group 2 ... and then repeating the process for the new blocks. It's also possible to use this technique in a mode where the main function; is compiled with GlobalISel and the extracted basic blocks are compiled with; SelectionDAG (or the other way around) to leverage the existing quality of; another code generator to track down bugs.

The call stores any bit of the pointer carrying information into a place,; and the stored bits can be read from the place by the caller after this call; exits. .. code-block:: llvm. @glb = global ptr null; @glb2 = global ptr null; @glb3 = global ptr null; @glbi = global i32 0. define ptr @f(ptr %a, ptr %b, ptr %c, ptr %d, ptr %e) {; store ptr %a, ptr @glb ; %a is captured by this call. store ptr %b, ptr @glb2 ; %b isn't captured because the stored value is overwritten by the store below; store ptr null, ptr @glb2. store ptr %c, ptr @glb3; call void @g",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:143770,optimiz,optimization,143770,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"f:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors. There are additional areas that LLVM does not directly address:. * Registration of global roots with the runtime. * Registration of stack map entries with the runtime. * The functions used by the program to allocate memory, trigger a collection,; etc. * Computation or compilation of type maps, or registration of them with the; runtime. These are used to crawl the heap for object references. In general, LLVM's support for GC does not include features which can be; adequately addressed with other features of the IR and does not specify a; particular binary interface. On the plus side, this means that you should be; able to integrate LLVM with an existing runtime. On the other hand, it can; have the effect of leaving a lot of work for the developer of a novel; language.

If it can prove, through the use of alias analysis, that an; argument is *only* loaded, then it can pass the value into the function instead; of the address of the value. This can cause recursive simplification of code; and lead to the elimination of allocas (especially in C++ template code like; the STL). This pass also handles aggregate arguments that are passed into a function,; scalarizing them if the elements of the aggregate are only loaded. Note that; it refuses to scalarize aggregates which would require passing in more than; three operands to the function, because passing thousands of operands for a; large array or structure is unprofitable!. Note that this transformation could also be done for arguments that are only; stored to (returning the value instead), but does not currently. This case; would be best handled when and if LLVM starts supporting multiple return values; from functions. ``block-placement``: Profile Guided Basic Block Placement; ---------------------------------------------------------.

All or some columns can be cached. Two versions of the method are proposed: one which allows to explicitly list the types of the columns and another one allowing to let the system infer them (the same mechanism of the `Snapshot` method).

Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer. Withholding; these potentially stale variable values from the developer diminishes the; amount of available debug information, but increases the reliability of the; remaining information.

Non-plugins will need to be linked, and; are thus loaded at start-up. Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class.

Appendix A: Bang Operators; ==========================. Bang operators act as functions in value expressions. A bang operator takes; one or more arguments, operates on them, and produces a result. If the; operator produces a boolean result, the result value will be 1 for true or 0; for false. When an operator tests a boolean argument, it interprets 0 as false; and non-0 as true. .. warning::; The ``!getop`` and ``!setop`` bang operators are deprecated in favor of; ``!getdagop`` and ``!setdagop``. ``!add(``\ *a*\ ``,`` *b*\ ``, ...)``; This operator adds *a*, *b*, etc., and produces the sum. ``!and(``\ *a*\ ``,`` *b*\ ``, ...)``; This operator does a bitwise AND on *a*, *b*, etc., and produces the; result. A logical AND can be performed if all the arguments are either; 0 or 1. ``!cast<``\ *type*\ ``>(``\ *a*\ ``)``; This operator performs a cast on *a* and produces the result.; If *a* is not a string, then a straightforward cast is performed, say; between an ``int`` and a ``bit``, or between record types. This allows; casting a record to a class. If a record is cast to ``string``, the; record's name is produced. If *a* is a string, then it is treated as a record name and looked up in; the list of all defined records. The resulting record is expected to be of; the specified *type*. For example, if ``!cast<``\ *type*\ ``>(``\ *name*\ ``)``; appears in a multiclass definition, or in a; class instantiated inside a multiclass definition, and the *name* does not; reference any template arguments of the multiclass, then a record by; that name must have been instantiated earlier; in the source file.

Performance,"filing tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option.

In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms.

An `lfence` instruction can be used to prevent subsequent loads from; speculatively executing until all prior mispredicted predicates have resolved.; We can use this broader barrier to speculative loads executing between; functions. We emit it in the entry block to handle calls, and prior to each; return. This approach also has the advantage of providing the strongest degree; of mitigation when mixed with unmitigated code by halting all misspeculation; entering a function which is mitigated, regardless of what occurred in the; caller. However, such a mixture is inherently more risky. Whether this kind of; mixture is a sufficient mitigation requires careful analysis. Unfortunately, experimental results indicate that the performance overhead of; this approach is very high for certain patterns of code. A classic example is; any form of recursive evaluation engine. The hot, rapid call and return; sequences exhibit dramatic performance loss when mitigated with `lfence`. This; component alone can regress performance by 2x or more, making it an unpleasant; tradeoff even when only used in a mixture of code. ##### Use an internal TLS location to pass predicate state. We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention.

The ROOT Linear algebra package is documented in a separate chapter (see; ""Linear Algebra in ROOT""). `SMatrix` is a C++ package, for high; performance vector and matrix computations. It has been introduced in; ROOT v5.08. It is optimized for describing small matrices and vectors; and It can be used only in problems when the size of the matrices is; known at compile time, like in the tracking reconstruction of physics; experiments. It is based on a C++ technique, called expression; templates, to achieve an high level optimization. The C++ templates can; be used to implement vector and matrix expressions such that these; expressions can be transformed at compile time to code which is; equivalent to hand optimized code in a low-level language like FORTRAN; or C (see for example T. Veldhuizen, Expression Templates, C++ Report,; 1995). The `SMatrix` has been developed initially by T. Glebe in; Max-Planck-Institut, Heidelberg, as part of the `HeraB` analysis; framework. A subset of the original package has been now incorporated in; the ROOT distribution, with the aim to provide a stand-alone and high; performance matrix package. The API of the current package differs from; the original one, in order to be compliant to the ROOT coding; conventions. `SMatrix` contains the generic **`ROOT::Math::SMatrix`** and; **`R",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:99154,optimiz,optimized,99154,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"for specialized cases, where the outcome; of a condition is severely skewed. As a result, the optimizer can be extremely; aggressive, which can result in performance degradation if the outcome is less; predictable than the annotation suggests. Even when the annotation is correct; 90% of the time, it may be beneficial to either remove the annotation or to use; a different intrinsic that can communicate the probability more directly. Because this may be too strict, MisExpect diagnostics are not enabled by; default, and support an additional flag to tolerate some deviation from the; exact thresholds. The ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N`` accepts; deviations when comparing branch weights within ``N%`` of the expected values.; So passing ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=5`` will not report diagnostic messages; if the branch weight from the profile is within 5% of the weight added by; the ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic. MisExpect diagnostics are also available in the form of optimization remarks,; which can be serialized and processed through the ``opt-viewer.py``; scripts in LLVM. .. option:: -Rpass=misexpect. Enables optimization remarks for misexpect when profiling data conflicts with; use of ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics. .. option:: -Wmisexpect. Enables misexpect warnings when profiling data conflicts with use of; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics. .. option:: -fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N. Relaxes misexpect checking to tolerate profiling values within N% of the; expected branch weight. e.g., a value of ``N=5`` allows misexpect to check against; ``0.95 * Threshold``. LLVM supports 4 types of profile formats: Frontend, IR, CS-IR, and; Sampling.

In the right panel, we will see all the; volumes contained by `TOP` (if the same is positioned 4 times we will; get 4 identical items). This rule will apply to any clicked volume in; the hierarchy.

Performance,"form, internal libraries built as part of the software itself to provide structure, and third-party libraries. For each library, one needs to access both its interface (API) and its implementation. In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):. .. code-block:: c. #include <SomeLib.h>. The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker. Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library. Problems with the current model; -------------------------------; The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:. * **Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the; compiler must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every; header it includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion. If any of the; active macro definitions happens to collide with a name in the; library, it can break the library API or cause compilation failures; in the library header itself.

In any case, please don't use it. .. _dss_bitvector:. BitVector; ^^^^^^^^^. The BitVector container provides a dynamic size set of bits for manipulation.; It supports individual bit setting/testing, as well as set operations. The set; operations take time O(size of bitvector), but operations are performed one word; at a time, instead of one bit at a time. This makes the BitVector very fast for; set operations compared to other containers. Use the BitVector when you expect; the number of set bits to be high (i.e. a dense set). .. _dss_smallbitvector:. SmallBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed. It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare. At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe).

The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits of the mask are on, the intrinsic is identical to a regular vector load or store. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mload:. '``llvm.masked.load.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic.

Performance,"fset`` 32-bit integer ``reg offset`` is the dword offset into the GFXIP register space of; a GRBM register (i.e., driver accessible GPU register number, not; shader GPR register number). The driver is required to program each; specified register to the corresponding specified value when; executing this pipeline. Typically, the ``reg offsets`` are the; ``uint16_t`` offsets to each register as defined by the hardware; chip headers. The register is set to the provided value. However, a; ``reg offset`` that specifies a user data register (e.g.,; COMPUTE_USER_DATA_0) needs special treatment.

Performance,"fsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python (extension); modules, and what to expect if you use the normal inspection tools (such; as e.g. '`dir()`').

Performance,"ften require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n. LLVM does not enforce this relationship between the object and derived pointer; (although a particular :ref:`collector strategy <plugin>` might). However, it; would be an unusual collector that violated it. The use of these intrinsics is naturally optional if the target GC does not; require the corresponding barrier. The GC strategy used with such a collector; should replace the intrinsic calls with the corresponding ``load`` or; ``store`` instruction if they are used. One known deficiency with the current design is that the barrier intrinsics do; not include the size or alignment of the underlying operation performed. It is; currently assumed that the operation is of pointer size and the alignment is; assumed to be the target machine's default alignment.

The exact code generated is specified by the; Function's selected :ref:`GC strategy <plugin>`. Many important algorithms require write barriers, including generational and; concurrent collectors.

Performance,"functions support temporary ranges, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Letter, Count] : zip(SmallVector<char>{'a', 'b', 'c'}, Counts)); errs() << Letter << "": "" << Count << ""\n"";. The difference between the functions in the ``zip`` family is how they behave; when the supplied ranges have different lengths:. * ``zip_equal`` -- requires all input ranges have the same length.; * ``zip`` -- iteration stops when the end of the shortest range is reached.; * ``zip_first`` -- requires the first range is the shortest one.; * ``zip_longest`` -- iteration continues until the end of the longest range is; reached. The non-existent elements of shorter ranges are replaced with; ``std::nullopt``. The length requirements are checked with ``assert``\ s. As a rule of thumb, prefer to use ``zip_equal`` when you expect all; ranges to have the same lengths, and consider alternative ``zip`` functions only; when this is not the case. This is because ``zip_equal`` clearly communicates; this same-length assumption and has the best (release-mode) runtime performance. .. _uf_enumerate:. ``enumerate``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``enumerate`` functions allows to iterate over one or more ranges while; keeping track of the index of the current loop iteration. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Idx, BB, Value] : enumerate(Phi->blocks(),; Phi->incoming_values())); errs() << ""#"" << Idx << "" "" << BB->getName() << "": "" << *Value << ""\n"";. The current element index is provided as the first structured bindings element.; Alternatively, the index and the element value can be obtained with the; ``index()`` and ``value()`` member functions:. .. code-block:: c++. char Letters[26] = ...;; for (auto En : enumerate(Letters)); errs() << ""#"" << En.index() << "" "" << En.value() << ""\n"";.

The third section is the *Resource pressure view*. This view reports; the average number of resource cycles consumed every iteration by instructions; for every processor resource unit available on the target. Information is; structured in two tables. The first table reports the number of resource cycles; spent on average every iteration. The second table correlates the resource; cycles to the machine instruction in the sequence. For example, every iteration; of the instruction vmulps always executes on resource unit [6]; (JFPU1 - floating point pipeline #1), consuming an average of 1 resource cycle; per iteration. Note that on AMD Jaguar, vector floating-point multiply can; only be issued to pipeline JFPU1, while horizontal floating-point additions can; only be issued to pipeline JFPU0. The resource pressure view helps with identifying bottlenecks caused by high; usage of specific hardware resources. Situations with resource pressure mainly; concentrated on a few resources should, in general, be avoided. Ideally,; pressure should be uniformly distributed between multiple resources.

Performance,"g a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

In ThinLTO mode, as with regular LTO, clang emits LLVM bitcode after the; compile phase. The ThinLTO bitcode is augmented with a compact summary; of the module. During the link step, only the summaries are read and; merged into a combined summary index, which includes an index of function; locations for later cross-module function importing.

Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely.

Performance,"g of a loop can be prevented by specifying ``unroll(disable)``. Loop unroll parameters can be controlled by options; `-mllvm -unroll-count=n` and `-mllvm -pragma-unroll-threshold=n`. Loop Distribution; -----------------. Loop Distribution allows splitting a loop into multiple loops. This is; beneficial for example when the entire loop cannot be vectorized but some of the; resulting loops can. If ``distribute(enable))`` is specified and the loop has memory dependencies; that inhibit vectorization, the compiler will attempt to isolate the offending; operations into a new loop. This optimization is not enabled by default, only; loops marked with the pragma are considered. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop distribute(enable); for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {; S1: A[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i];; S2: C[i] = D[i] * E[i];; }. This loop will be split into two loops between statements S1 and S2. The; second loop containing S2 will be vectorized. Loop Distribution is currently not enabled by default in the optimizer because; it can hurt performance in some cases. For example, instruction-level; parallelism could be reduced by sequentializing the execution of the; statements S1 and S2 above. If Loop Distribution is turned on globally with; ``-mllvm -enable-loop-distribution``, specifying ``distribute(disable)`` can; be used the disable it on a per-loop basis. Additional Information; ----------------------. For convenience multiple loop hints can be specified on a single line. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(4) interleave_count(8); for(...) {; ...; }. If an optimization cannot be applied any hints that apply to it will be ignored.; For example, the hint ``vectorize_width(4)`` is ignored if the loop is not; proven safe to vectorize. To identify and diagnose optimization issues use; `-Rpass`, `-Rpass-missed`, and `-Rpass-analysis` command line options. See the; user guide for details.

The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; As a rule of thumb, if about 10% of classes are used, it takes several; hundreds of bound classes before the cppyy-",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:8371,load,loading,8371,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['load'],['loading']

Because of the deep analysis performed by state-of-the-art static; analysis tools, static analysis can be much slower than compilation.; While the Clang Static Analyzer is being designed to be as fast and; light-weight as possible, please do not expect it to be as fast as compiling a; program (even with optimizations enabled).

It can falsely flag bugs in a program where; the code behaves correctly. Because some code checks require more analysis; precision than others, the frequency of false positives can vary widely between; different checks.

You can then query ``MemorySSA`` for things; like the dominance relation between ``MemoryAccess``\ es, and get the; ``MemoryAccess`` for any given ``Instruction`` . When ``MemorySSA`` is done building, it also hands you a ``MemorySSAWalker``; that you can use (see below). The walker; ----------. A structure that helps ``MemorySSA`` do its job is the ``MemorySSAWalker``, or; the walker, for short.

Additionally, we would like; to be able to statically eliminate many bounds checks in Java; programs... for example. 2. Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different.

Performance,"ge, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and; an external symbol relocation map. .. image:: MCJIT-load-object.png. When RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject returns, all of the code and data; sections for the object will have been loaded into memory allocated by the; memory manager and relocation information will have been prepared, but the; relocations have not yet been applied and the generated code is still not; ready to be executed. [Currently (as of August 2013) the MCJIT engine will immediately apply; relocations when loadObject completes. However, this shouldn't be; happening. Because the code may have been generated for a remote target,; the client should be given a chance to re-map the section addresses before; relocations are applied. It is possible to apply relocations multiple; times, but in the case where addresses are to be re-mapped, this first; application is wasted effort.]. Address Remapping; =================.

This option is currently experimental. .. _cfi-canonical-jump-tables:. ``-fsanitize-cfi-canonical-jump-tables``; ----------------------------------------. The default behavior of Clang's indirect function call checker will replace; the address of each CFI-checked function in the output file's symbol table; with the address of a jump table entry which will pass CFI checks. We refer; to this as making the jump table `canonical`. This property allows code that; was not compiled with ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` to take a CFI-valid address; of a function, but it comes with a couple of caveats that are especially; relevant for users of cross-DSO CFI:. - There is a performance and code size overhead associated with each; exported function, because each such function must have an associated; jump table entry, which must be emitted even in the common case where the; function is never address-taken anywhere in the program, and must be used; even for direct calls between DSOs, in addition to the PLT overhead. - There is no good way to take a CFI-valid address of a function written in; assembly or a language not supported by Clang. The reason is that the code; generator would need to insert a jump table in order to form a CFI-valid; address for assembly functions, but there is no way in general for the; code generator to determine the language of the function. This may be; possible with LTO in the intra-DSO case, but in the cross-DSO case the only; information available is the function declaration. One possible solution; is to add a C wrapper for each assembly function, but these wrappers can; present a significant maintenance burden for heavy users of assembly in; addition to adding runtime overhead.

Performance,"ges in the source IR can have a large effect on the; generated code. Beyond the specific items on the list below, it's worth noting that the most; mature frontend for LLVM is Clang. As a result, the further your IR gets from; what Clang might emit, the less likely it is to be effectively optimized. It; can often be useful to write a quick C program with the semantics you're trying; to model and see what decisions Clang's IRGen makes about what IR to emit.; Studying Clang's CodeGen directory can also be a good source of ideas. Note; that Clang and LLVM are explicitly version locked so you'll need to make sure; you're using a Clang built from the same git revision or release as the LLVM; library you're using. As always, it's *strongly* recommended that you track; tip of tree development, particularly during bring up of a new project. The Basics; ^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Make sure that your Modules contain both a data layout specification and; target triple. Without these pieces, non of the target specific optimization; will be enabled. This can have a major effect on the generated code quality. #. For each function or global emitted, use the most private linkage type; possible (private, internal or linkonce_odr preferably). Doing so will; make LLVM's inter-procedural optimizations much more effective. #. Avoid high in-degree basic blocks (e.g. basic blocks with dozens or hundreds; of predecessors). Among other issues, the register allocator is known to; perform badly with confronted with such structures. The only exception to; this guidance is that a unified return block with high in-degree is fine. Use of allocas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Performance,"gger``. The ``AliasSetTracker`` class (which is used by ``LICM``) makes a; non-deterministic number of alias queries. This can cause debugging techniques; involving pausing execution after a predetermined number of queries to be; unreliable. Many alias queries can be reformulated in terms of other alias queries. When; multiple ``AliasAnalysis`` queries are chained together, it would make sense to; start those queries from the beginning of the chain, with care taken to avoid; infinite looping, however currently an implementation which wants to do this can; only start such queries from itself. Using alias analysis results; ============================. There are several different ways to use alias analysis results. In order of; preference, these are:. Using the ``MemoryDependenceAnalysis`` Pass; -------------------------------------------. The ``memdep`` pass uses alias analysis to provide high-level dependence; information about memory-using instructions. This will tell you which store; feeds into a load, for example. It uses caching and other techniques to be; efficient, and is used by Dead Store Elimination, GVN, and memcpy optimizations. .. _AliasSetTracker:. Using the ``AliasSetTracker`` class; -----------------------------------. Many transformations need information about alias **sets** that are active in; some scope, rather than information about pairwise aliasing. The; `AliasSetTracker <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasSetTracker.html>`__; class is used to efficiently build these Alias Sets from the pairwise alias; analysis information provided by the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface.

Remark streamers; ================. The ``RemarkStreamer`` interface is used to unify the serialization; capabilities of remarks across all the components that can generate remarks. All remark serialization should go through the main remark streamer, the; ``llvm::remarks::RemarkStreamer`` set up in the ``LLVMContext``. The interface; takes remark objects converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark``, and takes care of; serializing it to the requested format, using the requested type of metadata,; etc. Typically, a specialized remark streamer will hold a reference to the one set; up in the ``LLVMContext``, and will operate on its own type of diagnostics. For example, LLVM IR passes will emit ``llvm::DiagnosticInfoOptimization*``; that get converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark`` objects. Then, clang could set; up its own specialized remark streamer that takes ``clang::Diagnostic``; objects. This can allow various components of the frontend to emit remarks; using the same techniques as the LLVM remarks. This gives us the following advantages:. * Composition: during the compilation pipeline, multiple components can set up; their specialized remark streamers that all emit remarks through the same; main streamer.; * Re-using the remark infrastructure in ``lib/Remarks``.; * Using the same file and format for the remark emitters created throughout the; compilation. at the cost of an extra layer of abstraction. ..

Performance,"gh the vtable.; This is not the same as the linkage of the vtable, because call sites could be; using a pointer of a more widely-visible base class. For example, consider this; code:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((visibility(""default""))); struct A {; virtual void f();; };. __attribute__((visibility(""hidden""))); struct B : A {; virtual void f();; };. With LTO, we know that all code which can see the declaration of ``B`` is; visible to us. However, a pointer to a ``B`` could be cast to ``A*`` and passed; to another linkage unit, which could then call ``f`` on it. This call would; load from the vtable for ``B`` (using the object pointer), and then call; ``B::f``. This means we can't remove the function pointer from ``B``'s vtable,; or the implementation of ``B::f``. However, if we can see all code which knows; about any dynamic base class (which would be the case if ``B`` only inherited; from classes with hidden visibility), then this optimisation would be valid. This concept is represented in IR by the ``!vcall_visibility`` metadata; attached to vtable objects, with the following values:. .. list-table::; :header-rows: 1; :widths: 10 90. * - Value; - Behavior. * - 0 (or omitted); - **Public**; Virtual function calls using this vtable could be made from external; code. * - 1; - **Linkage Unit**; All virtual function calls which might use this vtable are in the; current LTO unit, meaning they will be in the current module once; LTO linking has been performed. * - 2; - **Translation Unit**; All virtual function calls which might use this vtable are in the; current module. In addition, all function pointer loads from a vtable marked with the; ``!vcall_visibility`` metadata (with a non-zero value) must be done using the; :ref:`llvm.type.checked.load <type.checked.load>` intrinsic, so that virtual; calls sites can be correlated with the vtables which they might load from.; Other parts of the vtable (RTTI, offset-to-top, ...) can still be accessed with; normal loads.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst:10176,perform,performed,10176,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,6,"['load', 'perform']","['load', 'loads', 'performed']"
Performance,"gical and Physical Objects. Some viewers can support two types of object placement:. - Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference; frame - e.g. a sphere, radius `r`, at `x`, `y`, `z`. - Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique; piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a; sphere `S` (radius `r`), place copy at `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, another; copy at `x2`, `y2`, `z2` etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT's; **`TGeo`** package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated; placements of relatively few unique ""shapes"". Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of; this by identifying unique logical shapes from the `fID` logical ID; member of **`TBuffer3D`**. If repeated addition of the same `fID` is; found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does; not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL; specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in; these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be; described in **`TBuffer3D`** in the local reference frame, complete with; the local`/`master translation. In some cases you will not have a real; object you can reasonably set **`TBuffer3D::fID` to, or the object is; recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in; these cases, set `TBuffer3D::fID` to 0 (null).**. The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the; **`TVirtualViewer3D`** interface method: `PreferLocalFrame()`. If this; returns `kTRUE` you can make repeated calls to `AddObject()`, with; **`TBuffer3D`** containing the same `fID`, and different `fLocalMaster`; placements.

Performance,"gisters <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more.

Global Variables; ----------------. Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time; instead of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`. Either global variable definitions or declarations may have an explicit section; to be placed in and may have an optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers.

The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document.

Performance,"h is also very fast and uses; only three words for its state. ### gEnv. **`gEnv`** is the global variable (of type **`TEnv`**) with all the; environment settings for the current session. This variable is set by; reading the contents of a `.rootrc` file (or; `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`) at the beginning of the root session.; See Environment Setup below for more information. ## Environment Setup. The behavior of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; .`rootrc` file. At start-up, ROOT looks for a .`rootrc` file in the; following order:. - `./.rootrc` *`//local directory`*. - `$HOME/.rootrc ` *`//user directory`*. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc ` *`//global ROOT directory`*. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. While in; a session, to see current settings, you can do:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gEnv->Print(); ```. The `rootrc` file typically looks like:. ```; # Path used by dynamic loader to find shared libraries; Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath: .:~/rootlibs:$(ROOTSYS)/lib; Unix.*.Root.MacroPath: .:~/rootmacros:$(ROOTSYS)/macros. # Path where to look for TrueType fonts; Unix.*.Root.UseTTFonts: true; Unix.*.Root.TTFontPath:; ...; # Activate memory statistics; Rint.Load: rootalias.C; Rint.Logon: rootlogon.C; Rint.Logoff: rootlogoff.C; ...; Rint.Canvas.MoveOpaque: false; Rint.Canvas.HighLightColor: 5; ```. The various options are explained in `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`. The; `.rootrc` file contents are combined. For example, if the flag to use; true type fonts is set to true in the `system.rootrc` file, you have; to set explicitly it false in your local `.rootrc` file if you do not; want to use true type fonts. Removing the `UseTTFonts `statement in; the local `.rootrc` file will not disable true fonts. The value of the; environment variable `ROOTDEBUG` overrides the value in the `.rootrc`; file at startup.

However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization. However, when; excess precision arithmetic is in use, Clang does not guarantee strict; reproducibility, and future compiler releases may recognize more; opportunities to use excess precision arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point; builtins. Clang does not use excess precision arithmetic for most types or on most; targets.

Performance,"h previously recommended; approaches such as the `lfence` instruction. Just as users can restrict the; scope of `lfence` to control its performance impact, this mitigation technique; could be restricted in scope as well. However, it is important to understand what it would cost to get a fully; mitigated baseline. Here we assume targeting a Haswell (or newer) processor and; using all of the tricks to improve performance (so leaves the low 2gb; unprotected and +/- 2gb surrounding any PC in the program). We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers. We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

Performance,"h prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel.

The return address is also stored on the regular stack; for compatibility with unwinders, but is otherwise unused. The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and; an `implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc; (bionic). An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found; to have critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in; LLVM 9.0. Details on the x86_64 implementation can be found in the; `Clang 7.0.1 documentation`_. .. _`implementation of the runtime`: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/808d176e7e0dd727c7f929622ec017f6e065c582/libc/bionic/pthread_create.cpp#128; .. _`Clang 7.0.1 documentation`: https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.html.

This is in contrast to other; schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off; consuming more memory for shorter function prologs and epilogs with fewer; memory accesses. `Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks; on x86_64. Like the previous implementation of ShadowCallStack on x86_64, it is; inherently racy due to the architecture's use of the stack for calls and; returns. Intel `Control-flow Enforcement Technology`_ (CET) is a proposed hardware; extension that would add native support to use a shadow stack to store/check; return addresses at call/return time. Being a hardware implementation, it; would not suffer from race conditions and would not incur the overhead of; function instrumentation, but it does require operating system support. .. _`Return Flow Guard`: https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2016/11/02/return-flow-guard/; .. _`Control-flow Enforcement Technology",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst:1297,optimiz,optimize,1297,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,2,"['cache', 'optimiz']","['cache', 'optimize']"
Performance,"han `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require ind",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:35417,load,loaded,35417,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loaded']

LLVM includes several alias-analysis driven transformations which can be used; with any of the implementations above. The ``-adce`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-adce`` pass, which implements Aggressive Dead Code Elimination uses the; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface to delete calls to functions that do not have; side-effects and are not used. The ``-licm`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-licm`` pass implements various Loop Invariant Code Motion related; transformations. It uses the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface for several different; transformations:. * It uses mod/ref information to hoist or sink load instructions out of loops if; there are no instructions in the loop that modifies the memory loaded. * It uses mod/ref information to hoist function calls out of loops that do not; write to memory and are loop-invariant. * It uses alias information to promote memory objects that are loaded and stored; to in loops to live in a register instead. It can do this if there are no may; aliases to the loaded/stored memory location. The ``-argpromotion`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-argpromotion`` pass promotes by-reference arguments to be passed in; by-value instead. In particular, if pointer arguments are only loaded from it; passes in the value loaded instead of the address to the function. This pass; uses alias information to make sure that the value loaded from the argument; pointer is not modified between the entry of the function and any load of the; pointer.

Performance,"haracterization of the performance, and specific benchmarks are unlikely to; reveal especially interesting properties. ### Future Work: Fine Grained Control and API-Integration. The performance overhead of this technique is likely to be very significant and; something users wish to control or reduce. There are interesting options here; that impact the implementation strategy used. One particularly appealing option is to allow both opt-in and opt-out of this; mitigation at reasonably fine granularity such as on a per-function basis,; including intelligent handling of inlining decisions -- protected code can be; prevented from inlining into unprotected code, and unprotected code will become; protected when inlined into protected code. For systems where only a limited; set of code is reachable by externally controlled inputs, it may be possible to; limit the scope of mitigation through such mechanisms without compromising the; application's overall security. The performance impact may also be focused in a; few key functions that can be hand-mitigated in ways that have lower; performance overhead while the remainder of the application receives automatic; protection. For both limiting the scope of mitigation or manually mitigating hot functions,; there needs to be some support for mixing mitigated and unmitigated code; without completely defeating the mitigation. For the first use case, it would; be particularly desirable that mitigated code remains safe when being called; during misspeculation from unmitigated code. For the second use case, it may be important to connect the automatic; mitigation technique to explicit mitigation APIs such as what is described in; http://wg21.link/p0928 (or any other eventual API) so that there is a clean way; to switch from automatic to manual mitigation without immediately exposing a; hole. However, the design for how to do this is hard to come up with until the; APIs are better established. We will revisit this as those APIs mature.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:49671,perform,performance,49671,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,['perform'],['performance']

Each L1; quadrant has a separate request queue per L2 channel.

Performance,"hat have made existing approaches to safer C dialects difficult to; adopt, offering these properties that make it widely adoptable in practice:. * It is designed to preserve the Application Binary Interface (ABI).; * It interoperates well with plain C code.; * It can be adopted partially and incrementally while still providing safety; benefits.; * It is a conforming extension to C.; * Consequently, source code that adopts the extension can continue to be; compiled by toolchains that do not support the extension (CAVEAT: this still; requires inclusion of a header file macro-defining bounds annotations to; empty).; * It has a relatively low adoption cost. This document discusses the key designs of ``-fbounds-safety``. The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }.

Performance,"hat in safe floating-point; modes, such as `-ffp-model=precise` or `-ffp-model=strict`, this option; has no effect because the optimizer is prohibited from making unsafe; transformations. .. option:: -fexcess-precision:. The C and C++ standards allow floating-point expressions to be computed as if; intermediate results had more precision (and/or a wider range) than the type; of the expression strictly allows. This is called excess precision; arithmetic.; Excess precision arithmetic can improve the accuracy of results (although not; always), and it can make computation significantly faster if the target lacks; direct hardware support for arithmetic in a particular type. However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization. However, when; excess precision arithmetic is in use, Clang does not guarantee strict; reproducibility, and future compiler releases may recognize more; opportunities to use excess precision arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point; builtins. Clang does not use excess precision arithmetic for most types or on most; targets. For example, even on pre-SSE X86 targets where ``float`` and; ``double`` computations must be performed in the 80-bit X87 format, Clang; rounds all intermediate results correctly for their type. Clang currently; uses excess precision arithmetic by default only for the following types and; targets:. * ``_Float16`` on X86 targets without ``AVX512-FP16``. The ``-fexcess-precision=<value>`` option can be used to control the use of; excess precision arithmetic. Valid values are:. * ``standard`` - The default.

There are no additional semantics enforced in the definition; of such a method; it merely enables optimizations in callers. .. _arc.objects.operands.casts:. Bridged casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A :arc-term:`bridged cast` is a C-style cast annotated with one of three; keywords:. * ``(__bridge T) op`` casts the operand to the destination type ``T``. If; ``T`` is a retainable object pointer type, then ``op`` must have a; non-retainable pointer type. If ``T`` is a non-retainable pointer type,; then ``op`` must have a retainable object pointer type. Otherwise the cast; is ill-formed. There is no transfer of ownership, and ARC inserts no retain; operations.; * ``(__bridge_retained T) op`` casts the operand, which must have retainable; object pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a non-retainable; pointer type. ARC retains the value, subject to the usual optimizations on; local values, and the recipient is responsible for balancing that +1.; * ``(__bridge_transfer T) op`` casts the operand, which must have; non-retainable pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a; retainable object pointer type. ARC will release the value at the end of; the enclosing full-expression, subject to the usual optimizations on local; values. These casts are required in order to transfer objects in and out of ARC; control; see the rationale in the section on :ref:`conversion of retainable; object pointers <arc.objects.restrictions.conversion>`. Using a ``__bridge_retained`` or ``__bridge_transfer`` cast purely to convince; ARC to emit an unbalanced retain or release, respectively, is poor form. .. _arc.objects.restrictions:.

D may not be in the current compilation unit. .. note::. DWARF Version 5 states that DR can be an offset in a ``.debug_info``; section other than the one that contains the current compilation unit. It; states that relocation of references from one executable or shared object; file to another must be performed by the consumer. But given that DR is; defined as an offset in a ``.debug_info`` section this seems impossible.; If DR was defined as an implementation defined value, then the consumer; could choose to interpret the value in an implementation defined manner to; reference a debug information in another executable or shared object. In ELF the ``.debug_info`` section is in a non-\ ``PT_LOAD`` segment so; standard dynamic relocations cannot be used. But even if they were loaded; segments and dynamic relocations were used, DR would need to be the; address of D, not an offset in a ``.debug_info`` section. That would also; need DR to be the size of a global address. So it would not be possible to; use the 32-bit DWARF format in a 64-bit global address space. In addition,; the consumer would need to determine what executable or shared object the; relocated address was in so it could determine the containing compilation; unit.

Performance,"hat rules can be added to. If multiple opcodes are given, they are; all permanently bound to the same ruleset. The rules in a ruleset are executed; from top to bottom and will start again from the top if an instruction is; legalized as a result of the rules. If the ruleset is exhausted without; satisfying any rule, then it is considered unsupported. When it doesn't declare the instruction legal, each pass over the rules may; request that one type changes to another type. Sometimes this can cause multiple; types to change but we avoid this as much as possible as making multiple changes; can make it difficult to avoid infinite loops where, for example, narrowing one; type causes another to be too small and widening that type causes the first one; to be too big. In general, it's advisable to declare instructions legal as close to the top of; the rule as possible and to place any expensive rules as low as possible. This; helps with performance as testing for legality happens more often than; legalization and legalization can require multiple passes over the rules. As a concrete example, consider the rule::. getActionDefinitionsBuilder({G_ADD, G_SUB, G_MUL, G_AND, G_OR, G_XOR, G_SHL}); .legalFor({s32, s64, v2s32, v4s32, v2s64}); .clampScalar(0, s32, s64); .widenScalarToNextPow2(0);. and the instruction::. %2:_(s7) = G_ADD %0:_(s7), %1:_(s7). this doesn't meet the predicate for the :ref:`.legalFor() <legalfor>` as ``s7``; is not one of the listed types so it falls through to the; :ref:`.clampScalar() <clampscalar>`. It does meet the predicate for this rule; as the type is smaller than the ``s32`` and this rule instructs the legalizer; to change type 0 to ``s32``. It then restarts from the top. This time it does; satisfy ``.legalFor()`` and the resulting output is::. %3:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %0:_(s7); %4:_(s32) = G_ANYEXT %1:_(s7); %5:_(s32) = G_ADD %3:_(s32), %4:_(s32); %2:_(s7) = G_TRUNC %5:_(s32). where the ``G_ADD`` is legal and the other instructions are scheduled for; pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst:4864,perform,performance,4864,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Legalizer.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

Alternatively, it would be possible to; write a static checker which catches a subset of possible problems. However, no; such checker exists today. Rationale; =========.

The design of GEP has the following goals, in rough unofficial order of; priority:. * Support C, C-like languages, and languages which can be conceptually lowered; into C (this covers a lot). * Support optimizations such as those that are common in C compilers. In; particular, GEP is a cornerstone of LLVM's `pointer aliasing; model <LangRef.html#pointeraliasing>`_. * Provide a consistent method for computing addresses so that address; computations don't need to be a part of load and store instructions in the IR. * Support non-C-like languages, to the extent that it doesn't interfere with; other goals. * Minimize target-specific information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct.

The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases.

In order to obtain the correct ExplodedNode, a decision must be made; as to whether or not analysis can continue along the current path. This decision; is based on whether the detected bug is one that would prevent the program under; analysis from continuing. For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification. This ExplodedNode will be the one; returned by the most recent call to CheckerContext::addTransition.; If no transition has been performed during the current callback, the checker should call CheckerContext::addTransition(); and use the returned node for bug reporting. If analysis can not continue, then the current state should be transitioned; into a so-called sink node, a node from which no further analysis will be; performed. This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node. Like; addTransition, this returns an ExplodedNode with the updated; state, which can then be passed to the BugReport constructor. After a BugReport is created, it should be passed to the analyzer core; by calling CheckerContext::emitReport. AST Visitors; Some checks might not require path-sensitivity to be effective.

At best, such code would do twice as much work as; necessary; quite frequently, however, ARC and the explicit code would both; try to balance the same retain, leading to crashes.

This document describes the mechanism by which an LLVM based compiler; can provide this information to a language runtime/collector, and; ensure that all pointers can be read and updated if desired. Abstract Machine Model; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. At a high level, LLVM has been extended to support compiling to an abstract; machine which extends the actual target with a non-integral pointer type; suitable for representing a garbage collected reference to an object. In; particular, such non-integral pointer type have no defined mapping to an; integer representation. This semantic quirk allows the runtime to pick a; integer mapping for each point in the program allowing relocations of objects; without visible effects. This high level abstract machine model is used for most of the optimizer. As; a result, transform passes do not need to be extended to look through explicit; relocation sequence. Before starting code generation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa.

Instruction Flow; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; This section describes the instruction flow through the default pipeline of; :program:`llvm-mca`, as well as the functional units involved in the process. The default pipeline implements the following sequence of stages used to; process instructions. * Dispatch (Instruction is dispatched to the schedulers).; * Issue (Instruction is issued to the processor pipelines).; * Write Back (Instruction is executed, and results are written back).; * Retire (Instruction is retired; writes are architecturally committed). The in-order pipeline implements the following sequence of stages:; * InOrderIssue (Instruction is issued to the processor pipelines).; * Retire (Instruction is retired; writes are architecturally committed). :program:`llvm-mca` assumes that instructions have all been decoded and placed; into a queue before the simulation start.

Instruction Dispatch; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; During the dispatch stage, instructions are picked in program order from a; queue of already decoded instructions, and dispatched in groups to the; simulated hardware schedulers. The size of a dispatch group depends on the availability of the simulated; hardware resources. The processor dispatch width defaults to the value; of the ``IssueWidth`` in LLVM's scheduling model. An instruction can be dispatched if:. * The size of the dispatch group is smaller than processor's dispatch width.; * There are enough entries in the reorder buffer.; * There are enough physical registers to do register renaming.; * The schedulers are not full.

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane. For efficiency, the expression calculates the source location the wavefront as a; whole. This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix.

Performance,"he following trivial assembly::. f: // @f; movz	w8, #0x2a; ins 	v0.s[0], w8; ret. Problem; =======. The main problem is how vectors are represented in memory and in registers. First, a recap. The ""endianness"" of an item affects its representation in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:2683,load,load,2683,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['load']

The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk.

It is possible to put; ORC components together to make a non-lazy, in-process, single threaded JIT; or a lazy, out-of-process, concurrent JIT, or anything in between. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT; ===================. ORC provides two basic JIT classes off-the-shelf. These are useful both as; examples of how to assemble ORC components to make a JIT, and as replacements; for earlier LLVM JIT APIs (e.g. MCJIT). The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.take",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:3957,perform,performed,3957,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['perform'],['performed']

Performance,"heduling model provides an ""optimistic"" load-to-use latency (which; usually matches the load-to-use latency for when there is a hit in the L1D). :program:`llvm-mca` does not (on its own) know about serializing operations or; memory-barrier like instructions. The LSUnit used to conservatively use an; instruction's ""MayLoad"", ""MayStore"", and unmodeled side effects flags to; determine whether an instruction should be treated as a memory-barrier. This was; inaccurate in general and was changed so that now each instruction has an; IsAStoreBarrier and IsALoadBarrier flag. These flags are mca specific and; default to false for every instruction. If any instruction should have either of; these flags set, it should be done within the target's InstrPostProcess class.; For an example, look at the `X86InstrPostProcess::postProcessInstruction` method; within `llvm/lib/Target/X86/MCA/X86CustomBehaviour.cpp`. A load/store barrier consumes one entry of the load/store queue. A load/store; barrier enforces ordering of loads/stores. A younger load cannot pass a load; barrier. Also, a younger store cannot pass a store barrier. A younger load; has to wait for the memory/load barrier to execute. A load/store barrier is; ""executed"" when it becomes the oldest entry in the load/store queue(s). That; also means, by construction, all of the older loads/stores have been executed. In conclusion, the full set of load/store consistency rules are:. #. A store may not pass a previous store.; #. A store may not pass a previous load (regardless of ``-noalias``).; #.

The ``llvm/Support/Debug.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Debug_8h_source.html>`__) file provides a macro named; ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` that is a much nicer solution to this problem. Basically, you can; put arbitrary code into the argument of the ``LLVM_DEBUG`` macro, and it is only; executed if '``opt``' (or any other tool) is run with the '``-debug``' command; line argument:. .. code-block:: c++. LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() << ""I am here!\n"");. Then you can run your pass like this:. .. code-block:: none. $ opt < a.bc > /dev/null -mypass; <no output>; $ opt < a.bc > /dev/null -mypass -debug; I am here!. Using the ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macro instead of a home-brewed solution allows you to not; have to create ""yet another"" command line option for the debug output for your; pass. Note that ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macros are disabled for non-asserts builds, so they; do not cause a performance impact at all (for the same reason, they should also; not contain side-effects!). One additional nice thing about the ``LLVM_DEBUG()`` macro is that you can enable or; disable it directly in gdb. Just use ""``set DebugFlag=0``"" or ""``set; DebugFlag=1``"" from the gdb if the program is running. If the program hasn't; been started yet, you can always just run it with ``-debug``. .. _DEBUG_TYPE:.

Performance,"hen the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute. Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions.

Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not mean A noalias C), so it is not possible to; come up with a precise partitioning in all cases without variables to; represent every pair of possible aliases. Thus, partitioning; precisely may require introducing at least N^2 new virtual variables,; phi nodes, etc. Each of these variables may be clobbered at multiple def sites. To give an example, if you were to split up struct fields into; individual variables, all aliasing operations that may-def multiple struct; fields, will may-def more than one of them.

To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that representation directly.

Performance,"hey are variable length, inefficient to hash and compare when; long, expensive to copy, etc. StringMap is a specialized container designed to; cope with these issues. It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an; arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the; buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff).; The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable; length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the; same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object.; This container guarantees the ""``(char*)(&Value+1)``"" points to the key string; for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache; efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed; when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for; unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),; hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the; table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data; is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair). StringMap also provides query methods that take byte ranges, so it only ever; copies a string if a value is inserted into the table. StringMap iteration order, however, is not guaranteed to be deterministic, so; any uses which require that should instead use a std::map. .. _dss_indexmap:. llvm/ADT/IndexedMap.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

The biggest one containing all others defines the ""`world`"" of the; model. We will often call this `master reference system (MARS)`. Going; on and opening our packs, we will obviously find out some empty ones,; otherwise, something is very wrong... We will call these leaves (by; analogy with a tree structure).

If the class is instantiated with a tree as a; parameter to the constructor, `fChain` will point to the tree named in; the parameter. Next is `fCurrent`, which is also a pointer to the; current tree/chain. Its role is only relevant when we have multiple; trees chained together in a **`TChain`**. The class definition shows us; that this tree has one branch and one leaf per data member. The methods; of `MyClass` are:. - `MyClass(TTree *tree=0) -` this constructor has an optional tree; for a parameter. If you pass a tree, `MyClass` will use it rather; than the tree from which it was created. - `void Init(TTree *tree) -` it is called by the constructor to; initialize the tree for reading. It associates each branch with the; corresponding leaf data member. - `~MyClass() - `the destructor, nothing special. - `Int_t GetEntry(Int_t entry) -` it loads the class with the entry; specified. Once you have executed `GetEntry`, the leaf data members; in `MyClass` are set to the values of the entry. For example,; `GetEntry(12)` loads the 13th event into the event data member of; `MyClass` (note that the first entry is 0). `GetEntry` returns the; number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read; twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case `GetEntry`; returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return; of 0 means an error has occurred while reading. - `Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry)` and `void Notify()` - these two; methods are related to chains. `LoadTree` will load the tree; containing the specified entry from a chain of trees. Notify is; called by `LoadTree` to adjust the branch addresses. - `void Loop()` - it is the skeleton method that loops through each; entry of the tree.

Performance,"his guidance is that a unified return block with high in-degree is fine. Use of allocas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An alloca instruction can be used to represent a function scoped stack slot,; but can also represent dynamic frame expansion. When representing function; scoped variables or locations, placing alloca instructions at the beginning of; the entry block should be preferred. In particular, place them before any; call instructions. Call instructions might get inlined and replaced with; multiple basic blocks. The end result is that a following alloca instruction; would no longer be in the entry basic block afterward. The SROA (Scalar Replacement Of Aggregates) and Mem2Reg passes only attempt; to eliminate alloca instructions that are in the entry basic block. Given; SSA is the canonical form expected by much of the optimizer; if allocas can; not be eliminated by Mem2Reg or SROA, the optimizer is likely to be less; effective than it could be.

For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++g; ```. will compile `MyScript.C` with debug symbols; usually this means; giving the `-g` option to compiler. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++O; ```. will compile `MyScript.C` with optimizations; usually this means; giving the `-O` option to compiler. The syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```. is using the default optimization level. The initial default is to; compile with the same level of optimization as the root executable; itself. The default can be changed by:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gSystem->SetAclicMode(TSystem::kDebug);; root[] gSystem->SetAclicMode(TSystem::kOpt);; ```. Note that the commands:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+g; root[] .L MyScript.C+O; ```. respectively compile `MyScript.C` with debug and optimization if the; library does not exist yet; they will not change the debug and the; optimization level if the library already exist and it is up to date.; To use ACLiC from compiled code or from inside another macro, we; recommend using `gROOT->ProcessLine()`.

Performance,"however; the ""technological"" limitations of M can be seen around a maximum of 15; free parameters at a time. ## Interference with other packages ##. The new M has been designed to interfere as little as possible with; other programs or packages which may be loaded at the same time. M is; thread safe by default. Optionally the user can select a different way; of dynamically allocating memory in the class StackAllacator for M , in; which case (and after an entire recompilation of the whole library) the; thread safety is lost. ## Floating-point precision ##. [install:epsmac]. M is entirely based on double precision. The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method. With reduced precision, the user may find that certain features; sensitive to first and second differences ($\mbox{HESSE}$,; $\mbox{MINOS}$, $\mb",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:26925,perform,performed,26925,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['perform'],['performed']

This primarily consists of accesses; at compile-time constant offsets of global and local variables.

Performance,"i-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm. By default, clang will generate profile data by compiling a simple; hello world program. You can also tell clang use an external; project for generating profile data that may be a better fit for your; use case. The project you specify must either be a lit test suite; (use the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DATA option) or a CMake project (use the; CLANG_PERF_TRAINING_DATA_SOURCE_DIR option). For example, If you wanted to use the; `LLVM Test Suite <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite/>`_ to generate; profile data you would use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DBOO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst:5857,perform,performance,5857,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimizations', 'performance']"

Non-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations.

Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory).

In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type. Here are some common ways to avoid pointer element type accesses:. * For loads, use ``getType()``.; * For stores, use ``getValueOperand()->getType()``.; * Use ``getLoadStoreType()`` to handle both of the above in one call.; * For getelementptr instructions, use ``getSourceElementType()``.; * For calls, use ``getFunctionType()``.; * For allocas, use ``getAllocatedType()``.; * For globals, use ``getValueType()``.; * For consistency assertions, use; ``PointerType::isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()``.; * To create a pointer type in a different address space, use; ``PointerType::getWithSamePointeeType()``.; * To check that two pointers have the same element type, use; ``PointerType::hasSameElementTypeAs()``.; * While it is preferred to write code in a way that accepts both typed and; opaque pointers, ``Type::isOpaquePointerTy()`` and; ``PointerType::isOpaque()`` can be used to handle opaque pointers specially.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:6636,optimiz,optimizations,6636,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,2,"['load', 'optimiz']","['load', 'optimizations']"

For GCs which use barriers or unusual treatment of stack roots, the; implementor is responsibly for providing a custom pass to lower the; intrinsics with the desired semantics.

Performance,"iant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order.

CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic; operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those; optimizations useful. Notes for code generation; Code generation is essentially the same as that for unordered for loads and; stores. No fences are required. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are required; to appear as a single operation. Acquire; -------. Acquire provides a barrier of the sort necessary to acquire a lock to access; other memory with normal loads and stores. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_acquire``. It should also be; used for C++/C ``memory_order_consume``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Acquire only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with a Release; operation. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move stores from before an Acquire load or read-modify-write; operation to after it, and move non-Acquire loads from before an Acquire; operation to after it. Notes for code generation; Architectures with weak memory ordering (essentially everything relevant today; except x86 and SPARC) require some sort of fence to maintain the Acquire; semantics. The precise fences required varies widely by architecture, but for; a simple implementation, most architectures provide a barrier which is strong; enough for everything (``dmb`` on ARM, ``sync`` on PowerPC, etc.).

The code sequences used to implement the memory model specify the order of; instructions that a single thread must execute. The ``s_waitcnt`` and cache; management instructions such as ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` are defined with respect; to other memory instructions executed by the same thread. This allows them to be; moved earlier or later which can allow them to be combined with other instances; of the same instruction, or hoisted/sunk out of loops to improve performance.; Only the instructions related to the memory model are given; additional; ``s_waitcnt`` instructions are required to ensure registers are defined before; being used. These may be able to be combined with the memory model ``s_waitcnt``; instructions as described above. The AMDGPU backend supports the following memory models:. HSA Memory Model [HSA]_; The HSA memory model uses a single happens-before relation for all address; spaces (see :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`).; OpenCL Memory Model [OpenCL]_; The OpenCL memory model which has separate happens-before relations for the; global and local address spaces.

It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations.

Which then becomes the following trivial assembly::. f: // @f; movz	w8, #0x2a; ins 	v0.s[0], w8; ret. Problem; =======. The main problem is how vectors are represented in memory and in registers. First, a recap. The ""endianness"" of an item affects its representation in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endia",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:2458,load,loading,2458,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['load'],['loading']
Performance,"ic information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #. The second operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and it must be; indexed. #. There are no superfluous indices for the GEP instruction. #. Trailing zero indices are superfluous for pointer aliasing, but not for the; types of the pointers. #.

This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking.

Performance,"ich does multiple memory operations, like; ``LDRD`` on ARM without LPAE, or not naturally-aligned ``LDRD`` on LPAE ARM). Monotonic; ---------. Monotonic is the weakest level of atomicity that can be used in synchronization; primitives, although it does not provide any general synchronization. It; essentially guarantees that if you take all the operations affecting a specific; address, a consistent ordering exists. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_relaxed``; see those; standards for the exact definition. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution. The; guarantees in terms of synchronization are very weak, so make sure these are; only used in a pattern which you know is correct. Generally, these would; either be used for atomic operations which do not protect other memory (like; an atomic counter), or along with a ``fence``. Notes for optimizers; In terms of the optimizer, this can be treated as a read+write on the relevant; memory location (and alias analysis will take advantage of that). In addition,; it is legal to reorder non-atomic and Unordered loads around Monotonic; loads. CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic; operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those; optimizations useful. Notes for code generation; Code generation is essentially the same as that for unordered for loads and; stores. No fences are required. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are required; to appear as a single operation. Acquire; -------. Acquire provides a barrier of the sort necessary to acquire a lock to access; other memory with normal loads and stores. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_acquire``.

The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time.

Well-Formedness; ---------------. It is important to note that this document describes 'well formed' LLVM; assembly language. There is a difference between what the parser accepts; and what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following; instruction is syntactically okay, but not well formed:. .. code-block:: llvm. %x = add i32 1, %x. because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The; LLVM infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to; verify that an LLVM module is well formed.

The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"". If this argument is ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes must assume that the; rounding mode is unknown and may change at runtime. No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior.

Identifying pointers at run-time requires compiler support to; locate all places that hold live pointer variables at run-time, including the; :ref:`processor stack and registers <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective.

For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them.

There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:10795,optimiz,optimize,10795,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']
Performance,"ies does NOT imply; penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape. Choosing a normal container is therefore; recommended whenever possible. ![Assemblies of volumes](pictures/080001CF.png). ### Geometrical Transformations. All geometrical transformations handled by the modeller are provided as; a built-in package. This was designed to minimize memory requirements; and optimize performance of point/vector master-to-local and; local-to-master computation. We need to have in mind that a; transformation in **`TGeo`** has two major use-cases. The first one is; for defining the placement of a volume with respect to its container; reference frame. This frame will be called 'master' and the frame of the; positioned volume - 'local'. If `T` is a transformation used for; positioning volume daughters, then: `MASTER = T * LOCAL`. Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class. A general homogenous transformation is defined as a 4x4 matrix embedding; a rotation, a translation and a scale. The advantage of this description; is that each basic transformation can be represented as a homogenous; matrix, composition being performed as simple matrix multiplication. Rotation:; $\left|\begin{array}{cccc}; r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & 0 \\; r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & 0 \\; r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & 0 \\; 0 & 0 & 0 & 1; \end{array}; \right|$; Translation:; $\left|\begin{array}{ccc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:91644,perform,perform,91644,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing.

At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives.

When building your own executable you will have to link against the; libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide; states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all; relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by; `root-config -glibs`; the graphics libraries are retuned by; `root-config --libs`. These commands are commonly used in `Makefiles`.; Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph.

In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not.

C++20 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P1907R1 <https://wg21.link/P1907R1>`_ which extends allowed non-type template argument; kinds with e.g. floating point values and pointers and references to subobjects.; This feature is still experimental. Accordingly, ``__cpp_nontype_template_args`` was not updated.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_generalized_nttp)``. - Clang won't perform ODR checks for decls in the global module fragment any; more to ease the implementation and improve the user's using experience.; This follows the MSVC's behavior. Users interested in testing the more strict; behavior can use the flag '-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf'.; (`#79240 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79240>`_). C++23 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P0847R7: Deducing this <https://wg21.link/P0847R7>`_. Some related core issues were also; implemented (`CWG2553 <https://wg21.link/CWG2553>`_, `CWG2554 <https://wg21.link/CWG2554>`_,; `CWG2653 <https://wg21.link/CWG2653>`_, `CWG2687 <https://wg21.link/CWG2687>`_). Because the; support for this feature is still experimental, the feature test macro ``__cpp_explicit_this_parameter``; was not set in this version.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_explicit_this_parameter)``. - Added a separate warning to warn the use of attributes on lambdas as a C++23 extension; in previous language versions: ``-Wc++23-lambda-attributes`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:9175,perform,perform,9175,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"ified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior. The exception behavior argument is a metadata string describing the floating; point exception semantics that required for the intrinsic. This argument; must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""fpexcept.ignore""; ""fpexcept.maytrap""; ""fpexcept.strict"". If this argument is ""fpexcept.ignore"" optimization passes may assume that the; exception status flags will not be read and that floating-point exceptions will; be masked. This allows transformations to be performed that may change the; exception semantics of the original code. For example, FP operations may be; speculatively executed in this case whereas they must not be for either of the; other possible values of this argument. If the exception behavior argument is ""fpexcept.maytrap"" optimization passes; must avoid transformations that may raise exceptions that would not have been; raised by the original code (such as speculatively executing FP operations), but; passes are not required to preserve all exceptions that are implied by the; original code. For example, exceptions may be potentially hidden by constant; folding. If the exception behavior argument is ""fpexcept.strict"" all transformations must; strictly preserve the floating-point exception semantics of the original code.; Any FP exception that would have been raised by the original code must be raised; by the transformed co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:870074,optimiz,optimization,870074,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"ifying the check at each; call site to a range and alignment check. Shared library support; ======================. **EXPERIMENTAL**. The basic CFI mode described above assumes that the application is a; monolithic binary; at least that all possible virtual/indirect call; targets and the entire class hierarchy are known at link time. The; cross-DSO mode, enabled with **-f[no-]sanitize-cfi-cross-dso** relaxes; this requirement by allowing virtual and indirect calls to cross the; DSO boundary. Assuming the following setup: the binary consists of several; instrumented and several uninstrumented DSOs. Some of them may be; dlopen-ed/dlclose-d periodically, even frequently. - Calls made from uninstrumented DSOs are not checked and just work.; - Calls inside any instrumented DSO are fully protected.; - Calls between different instrumented DSOs are also protected, with; a performance penalty (in addition to the monolithic CFI; overhead).; - Calls from an instrumented DSO to an uninstrumented one are; unchecked and just work, with performance penalty.; - Calls from an instrumented DSO outside of any known DSO are; detected as CFI violations. In the monolithic scheme a call site is instrumented as. .. code-block:: none. if (!InlinedFastCheck(f)); abort();; call *f.

Its goal is to; replace the old Fit Panel and to provide more user friendly way for; performing, exploring and comparing fits. By design, this user interface is planned to contain two tabs:; ""General"" and ""Minimization"". Currently, the ""General"" tab provides; user interface elements for setting the fit function, fit method and; different fit, draw, print options.; The ""Minimization tab"" provides the option to set the Minimizer to use in the fit and; its specific options.

The pointer passed into cmpxchg must have alignment greater than or; equal to the size in memory of the operand. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The contents of memory at the location specified by the '``<pointer>``' operand; is read and compared to '``<cmp>``'; if the values are equal, '``<new>``' is; written to the location. The original value at the location is returned,; together with a flag indicating success (true) or failure (false). If the cmpxchg operation is marked as ``weak`` then a spurious failure is; permitted: the operation may not write ``<new>`` even if the comparison; matched. If the cmpxchg operation is strong (the default), the i1 value is 1 if and only; if the value loaded equals ``cmp``. A successful ``cmpxchg`` is a read-modify-write instruction for the purpose of; identifying release sequences.

Performance,"ignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #. Prefer globals over inttoptr of a constant address - this gives you; dereferencability information. In MCJIT, use getSymbolAddress to provide; actual address. #.

Performance,"il/llvm-dev/2015-February/081822.html>`_. Issues with explicit pointee types; ==================================. LLVM IR pointers can be cast back and forth between pointers with different; pointee types. The pointee type does not necessarily represent the actual; underlying type in memory. In other words, the pointee type carries no real; semantics. Historically LLVM was some sort of type-safe subset of C. Having pointee types; provided an extra layer of checks to make sure that the Clang frontend matched; its frontend values/operations with the corresponding LLVM IR. However, as other; languages like C++ adopted LLVM, the community realized that pointee types were; more of a hindrance for LLVM development and that the extra type checking with; some frontends wasn't worth it. LLVM's type system was `originally designed; <https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-01-GCCSummit2003.html>`_ to support high-level; optimization. However, years of LLVM implementation experience have demonstrated; that the pointee type system design does not effectively support; optimization. Memory optimization algorithms, such as SROA, GVN, and AA,; generally need to look through LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type.

For example, to run the plugin automatically after the main AST; action (i.e. the same as using `-add-plugin`):. .. code-block:: c++. // Automatically run the plugin after the main AST action; PluginASTAction::ActionType getActionType() override {; return AddAfterMainAction;; }. Interaction with ``-clear-ast-before-backend``; ----------------------------------------------. To reduce peak memory usage of the compiler, plugins are recommended to run; *before* the main action, which is usually code generation. This is because; having any plugins that run after the codegen action automatically turns off; ``-clear-ast-before-backend``. ``-clear-ast-before-backend`` reduces peak; memory by clearing the Clang AST after generating IR and before running IR; optimizations. Use ``CmdlineBeforeMainAction`` or ``AddBeforeMainAction`` as; ``getActionType`` to run plugins while still benefitting from; ``-clear-ast-before-backend``.

Possible Questions; ==================. How modules speed up compilation; --------------------------------. A classic theory for the reason why modules speed up the compilation is:; if there are ``n`` headers and ``m`` source files and each header is included by each source file,; then the complexity of the compilation is ``O(n*m)``;; But if there are ``n`` module interfaces and ``m`` source files, the complexity of the compilation is; ``O(n+m)``. So, using modules would be a big win when scaling.; In a simpler word, we could get rid of many redundant compilations by using modules. Roughly, this theory is correct. But the problem is that it is too rough.; The behavior depends on the optimization level, as we will illustrate below. First is ``O0``. The compilation process is described in the following graph. .. code-block:: none. ├-------------frontend----------┼-------------middle end----------------┼----backend----┤; │ │ │ │; └---parsing----sema----codegen--┴----- transformations ---- codegen ----┴---- codegen --┘. ┌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; | │; | source file │; | │; └---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┘. ┌--------┐; │ │; │imported│; │ │; │ code │; │ │; └--------┘. Here we can see that the source file (could be a non-module unit or a module unit) would get processed by the; whole pipeline.; But the imported code would only get involved in semantic analysis, which is mainly about name lookup,; overload resolution and template instantiation.; All of these processes are fast relative to the whole compilation process.; More importantly, the imported code only n",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:40218,optimiz,optimization,40218,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

For example, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`. The result will be `Bar` objects with data; member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is; to call `BypassStreamer(kFALSE)` for the **`TClonesArray`**. In this; case, the normal `Bar::Streamer` function will be called.

A volatile operation; may not modify any other memory accessible by the module being compiled.; A volatile operation may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation. As an exception to the preceding rule, the compiler may not assume execution; will continue after a volatile store operation. This restriction is necessary; to support the somewhat common pattern in C of intentionally storing to an; invalid pointer to crash the program. In the future, it might make sense to; allow frontends to control this behavior. IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into llvm.memcpy; or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are flagged volatile.; Likewise, the backend should never split or merge target-legal volatile; load/store instructions. Similarly, IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot; change from integer to floating-point or vice versa. .. admonition:: Rationale. Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported; data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C; this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native; hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types. The; frontend upholds these expectations, which are intentionally; unspecified in the IR.

It also allows the compiler to produce DWARF; that indexes the vector register if it spills scalar registers into portions; of a vector register. Since DWARF stack value entries have a base type and AMDGPU registers are a; vector of dwords, the ability to specify that a base type is a vector is; required.

To support this the CFI rule for the partially spilled; register needs to use an expression that uses the EXEC register as a bit mask to; select between the register (for inactive lanes) and the stack spill location; (for active lanes that are spilled). This needs to evaluate to a location; description, and not a value, as a debugger needs to change the value if the; user assigns to the variable. Another usage is to create an expression that evaluates to provide a vector of; logical PCs for active and inactive lanes in a SIMT execution model. Again the; EXEC register is used to select between active and inactive PC values. In order; to represent a vector of PC values, a way to create a composite location; description that is a vector of a single location is used.

Functions comparison; ====================; At first, let's define how exactly we compare complex objects. Complex object comparison (function, basic-block, etc) is mostly based on its; sub-object comparison results. It is similar to the next ""tree"" objects; comparison:. #. For two trees *T1* and *T2* we perform *depth-first-traversal* and have; two sequences as a product: ""*T1Items*"" and ""*T2Items*"". #.

The first parts to be compared are the function's attributes and some; properties that is outside the “attributes” term, but still could make the; function different without changing its body. This part of the comparison is; usually done within simple *cmpNumbers* or *cmpFlags* operations (e.g.; ``cmpFlags(F1->hasGC(), F2->hasGC())``).

Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch. For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of size between 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule. Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag.

The result is a little bit more complicated than we may expect; because LoopRotate ensures that the loop is in; :ref:`Loop Simplify Form <loop-terminology-loop-simplify>`; after rotation.; In this case, it inserted the %loop.preheader basic block so; that the loop has a preheader and it introduced the %loop.exit; basic block so that the loop has dedicated exits; (otherwise, %exit would be jumped from both %latch and %entry,; but %entry is not contained in the loop).; Note that a loop has to be in Loop Simplify Form beforehand; too for LoopRotate to be applied successfully. The main advantage of this form is that it allows hoisting; invariant instructions, especially loads, into the preheader.; That could be done in non-rotated loops as well but with; some disadvantages. Let's illustrate them with an example:. .. code-block:: C. for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; auto v = *p;; use(v);; }. We assume that loading from p is invariant and use(v) is some; statement that uses v.; If we wanted to execute the load only once we could move it; ""out"" of the loop body, resulting in this:. .. code-block:: C. auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }. However, now, in the case that n <= 0, in the initial form,; the loop body would never execute, and so, the load would; never execute. This is a problem mainly for semantic reasons.; Consider the case in which n <= 0 and loading from p is invalid.; In the initial program there would be no error. However, with this; transformation we would introduce one, effectively breaking; the initial semantics. To avoid both of these problems, we can insert a guard:. .. code-block:: C. if (n > 0) { // loop guard; auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }; }. This is certainly better but it could be improved slightly. Notice; that the check for whether n is bigger than 0 is executed twice (and; n does not change in between).

Performance,"ime to read sample** is the execution; time of the script `$ROOTSYS/test/eventb`. This script loops on all; events. For each event, the branch containing the number of tracks is; read. In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`.

Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count. Using this information, ``ConstraintElimination`` is able; to determine ``p + count`` doesn’t wrap.; * Accordingly, ``p + i`` and ``p + i + 1`` also don’t wrap.; * Therefore, ``p <= p + i`` and ``p + i + 1 <= p + count``.; * The if-condition simplifies to false and becomes dead code that the subsequent; optimization passes can remove. ``OptRemarks`` can be utilized to provide insights into performance tuning.

Internal bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Internal bounds annotations change a pointer into a wide pointer.

Performance,"imization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v532/index.html:2343,optimiz,optimization,2343,roofit/doc/v532/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v532/index.html,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"imizations that Result in Concurrent Iteration Execution; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. A compiler can perform loop optimizations that result in the generated code; executing multiple iterations concurrently. For example, software pipelining; schedules multiple iterations in an interleaved fashion to allow the; instructions of one iteration to hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language loop iterations are executing ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:33618,concurren,concurrency,33618,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,3,"['concurren', 'optimiz']","['concurrency', 'optimizations']"

For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` contains:. ::. !foo; !!1 !!3 !!5; !!2 !!4 !!6. will create two unique sections for function ``foo`` with the first; containing the odd numbered basic blocks and the second containing the; even numbered basic blocks. Basic block sections allow the linker to reorder basic blocks and enables; link-time optimizations like whole program inter-procedural basic block; reordering. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile information enables better optimization. For example, knowing that a; branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better decisions when; ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation. Regardless of which kind of profiling you use, be careful to collect profiles; by running your code with inputs that are representative of the typical; behavior. Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling.

The; ``module`` element defining a module ID must always be emitted before any; other elements that refer to that module ID, so that a filter never needs to; keep track of dangling references. The second ``%s`` is the module type and it; determines what the remaining fields are. The following module types are; supported:. * ``elf:%x``. Here ``%x`` encodes an ELF Build ID. The Build ID should refer to a single; linked binary. The Build ID string is the sole way to identify the binary from; which this module was loaded. Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:20452,load,load,20452,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['load'],['load']

The ``__builtin_expect_with_probability()`` builtin is typically used with; control flow conditions such as in ``if`` and ``switch`` statements to help; branch prediction. It means that its first argument ``expr`` is expected to take; the value of its second argument ``val`` with probability ``p``. ``p`` must be; within ``[0.0 ; 1.0]`` bounds. This builtin always returns the value of ``expr``. Query for this feature with ``__has_builtin(__builtin_expect_with_probability)``. ``__builtin_prefetch``; ----------------------. ``__builtin_prefetch`` is used to communicate with the cache handler to bring; data into the cache before it gets used. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c++. void __builtin_prefetch(const void *addr, int rw=0, int locality=3). **Example of use**:. .. code-block:: c++. __builtin_prefetch(a + i);. **Description**:. The ``__builtin_prefetch(addr, rw, locality)`` builtin is expected to be used to; avoid cache misses when the developer has a good understanding of which data; are going to be used next. ``addr`` is the address that needs to be brought into; the cache. ``rw`` indicates the expected access mode: ``0`` for *read* and ``1``; for *write*. In case of *read write* access, ``1`` is to be used. ``locality``; indicates the expected persistence of data in cache, from ``0`` which means that; data can be discarded from cache after its next use to ``3`` which means that; data is going to be reused a lot once in cache. ``1`` and ``2`` provide; intermediate behavior between these two extremes.

Performance,"inal pointer. Note again, however, that; dependence does not survive a store, so ARC does not guarantee the; continued validity of the return value past the end of the; full-expression. .. _arc.optimization.object_lifetime:. No object lifetime extension; ----------------------------. If, in the formal computation history of the program, an object ``X``; has been deallocated by the time of an observable side-effect, then; ARC must cause ``X`` to be deallocated by no later than the occurrence; of that side-effect, except as influenced by the re-ordering of the; destruction of objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:. Precise lifetime semantics; --------------------------. In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer held in; a ``__strong`` object will be retained for the full formal lifetime of the; object. Objects subject to this invariant have :arc-term:`precise lifetime; semantics`. By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do not have precise; lifetime semantics. Such objects are simply strong references which hold; values of retainable object pointer type, and these values are still fully; subject to the optimizations on values under local control. .. admonition:: Rationale. Applying these precise-lifetime semantics strictly would be prohibitive.; Many useful optimiz",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:83190,optimiz,optimization,83190,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times. There's; no immediate plans to make changes due to this, but alternate models may be; explored in the future. Relocations Along Exceptional Edges; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Relocations along exceptional paths are currently broken in ToT. In; particular, there is current no way to represent a rethrow on a path which; also has relocations.

Performance,"ind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space. Stack variables; work the same way, except that instead of being declared with global; variable definitions, they are declared with the `LLVM alloca; instruction <../../LangRef.html#alloca-instruction>`_:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @example() {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; ...; %tmp = load i32, i32* %X ; load the stack value %X from the stack.; %tmp2 = add i32 %tmp, 1 ; increment it; store i32 %tmp2, i32* %X ; store it back; ... This code shows an example of how you can declare and manipulate a stack; variable in the LLVM IR. Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:5050,load,load,5050,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,2,['load'],['load']

First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in. Once all of the alias sets are completed, your pass should; simply iterate through the constructed alias sets, using the ``AliasSetTracker``; ``begin()``/``end()`` methods. The ``AliasSet``\s formed by the ``AliasSetTracker`` are guaranteed to be; disjoint, calculate mod/ref information and volatility for the set, and keep; track of whether or not all of the pointers in the set are Must aliases. The; AliasSetTracker also makes sure that sets are properly folded due to call; instructions, and can provide a list of pointers in each set. As an example user of this, the `Loop Invariant Code Motion; <doxygen/structLICM.html>`_ pass uses ``AliasSetTracker``\s to calculate alias; sets for each loop nest. If an ``AliasSet`` in a loop is not modified, then all; load instructions from that set may be hoisted out of the loop. If any alias; sets are stored to **and** are must alias sets, then the stores may be sunk; to outside of the loop, promoting the memory location to a register for the; duration of the loop nest.

Basically the same as the corresponding LLVM class, with the template parameter removed: LLVM's SmallVectorBase; is templated over the type of fSize and fCapacity. It contains the parts of `RVec` that do not depend on the value; type.; No other classes in the hierarchy can contain data members! We expect the memory after `SmallVectorBase` to be; occupied by the small inline buffer. `SmallVectorTemplateCommon<T>`; - `getFirstEl()`: returns the address of the beginning of the small buffer; - `begin()`, `end()`, `front()`, `back()`, etc. Basically the same as the corresponding LLVM class.; It contains the parts that are independent of whether T is a POD or not. `SmallVectorTemplateBase<T, bool TriviallyCopiable>` and the specialization `SmallVectorTemplateBase<T, true>`; - `grow()`, `uninitialized_copy`, `uninitialized_move`, `push_back()`, `pop_back()`. This class contains the parts of `RVec` that can be optimized for trivially copiable types.; In particular, destruction can be skipped and memcpy can be used in place of copy/move construction.; These optimizations are inherited from LLVM's SmallVector. `RVecImpl<T>`; The analogous of LLVM's `SmallVectorImpl`, it factors out of `RVec` the parts that are independent of; the small buffer size, to limit the amount of code generated and provide a way to slice the small buffer; size when passing around `RVec` objects. `RVecN<T, N>`; It aggregates `RVecImpl` and `SmallVectorStorage` (see below) through public inheritance.; `N` is the small buffer size. `RVec<T>`; Inherits from `RVecN` and fixes the small buffer size `N` to a reasonable default.; We expect most users to use this type and only very rarely switch to `RVecN` to tweak the small buffer size. ### Helper types. - `SmallVectorAlignmentAndSize`: used to figure out the offset of the first small-buffer element in; `SmallVectorTemplateCommon::getFirstEl`; - `SmallVectorStorage`: pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/vecops/ARCHITECTURE.md:2838,optimiz,optimized,2838,math/vecops/ARCHITECTURE.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/vecops/ARCHITECTURE.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"ing instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:30245,load,load,30245,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"ing launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead. The compile callback will; compile the function, update the function pointer for the stub, then execute; the function. On all subsequent calls to the function, the function pointer; will point at the already-compiled function, so there is no further overhead; from the compiler.

Performance,"ing of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

Performance,"ing optimization for a range of function definitions, a; range-based pragma is provided. Its syntax is ``#pragma clang optimize``; followed by ``off`` or ``on``. All function definitions in the region between an ``off`` and the following; ``on`` will be decorated with the ``optnone`` attribute unless doing so would; conflict with explicit attributes already present on the function (e.g. the; ones that control inlining). .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang optimize off; // This function will be decorated with optnone.; int foo() {; // ... code; }. // optnone conflicts with always_inline, so bar() will not be decorated.; __attribute__((always_inline)) int bar() {; // ... code; }; #pragma clang optimize on. If no ``on`` is found to close an ``off`` region, the end of the region is the; end of the compilation unit. Note that a stray ``#pragma clang optimize on`` does not selectively enable; additional optimizations when compiling at low optimization levels. This feature; can only be used to selectively disable optimizations. The pragma has an effect on functions only at the point of their definition; for; function templates, this means that the state of the pragma at the point of an; instantiation is not necessarily relevant. Consider the following example:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T> T twice(T t) {; return 2 * t;; }. #pragma clang optimize off; template<typename T> T thrice(T t) {; return 3 * t;; }. int container(int a, int b) {; return twice(a) + thrice(b);; }; #pragma clang optimize on. In this example, the definition of the template function ``twice`` is outside; the pragma region, whereas the definition of ``thrice`` is inside the region.; The ``container`` function is also in the region and will not be optimized, but; it causes the instantiation of ``twice`` and ``thrice`` with an ``int`` type; of; these two instantiations, ``twice`` will be optimized (because its definition; was outside the region) and ``thrice`` will not be optimized.

Performance,"ing optimizer support to your; language, and adding JIT compiler support. These additions will; demonstrate how to get nice, efficient code for the Kaleidoscope; language. Trivial Constant Folding; ========================. Our demonstration for Chapter 3 is elegant and easy to extend.; Unfortunately, it does not produce wonderful code. The IRBuilder,; however, does give us obvious optimizations when compiling simple code:. ::. ready> def test(x) 1+2+x;; Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double 3.000000e+00, %x; ret double %addtmp; }. This code is not a literal transcription of the AST built by parsing the; input. That would be:. ::. ready> def test(x) 1+2+x;; Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double 2.000000e+00, 1.000000e+00; %addtmp1 = fadd double %addtmp, %x; ret double %addtmp1; }. Constant folding, as seen above, in particular, is a very common and; very important optimization: so much so that many language implementors; implement constant folding support in their AST representation. With LLVM, you don't need this support in the AST. Since all calls to; build LLVM IR go through the LLVM IR builder, the builder itself checked; to see if there was a constant folding opportunity when you call it. If; so, it just does the constant fold and return the constant instead of; creating an instruction. Well, that was easy :). In practice, we recommend always using; ``IRBuilder`` when generating code like this. It has no ""syntactic; overhead"" for its use (you don't have to uglify your compiler with; constant checks everywhere) and it can dramatically reduce the amount of; LLVM IR that is generated in some cases (particular for languages with a; macro preprocessor or that use a lot of constants). On the other hand, the ``IRBuilder`` is limited by the fact that it does; all of its analysis inline with the code as it is built. If you take a; slightly more complex example:. ::.

The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives.

Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of; Clang. To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the Features section, which breaks; each of these down and explains them in more detail. Why?. Development of the new front-end was started out of a need; for a compiler that allows better diagnostics, better integration with; IDEs, a license that is compatible with commercial products, and a; nimble compiler that is easy to develop and maintain. All of these were; motivations for starting work on a new front-end that could; meet these needs. Current Status. Clang is considered to; be a production quality C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ compiler when; targeting any target supported by LLVM. As example, Clang is used in; production to build performance-critical software like Chrome or Firefox.; If you are looking for source analysis or source-to-source; transformation tools, Clang is probably a great solution for you. Please see; the C++ status page or the; C status page for more information about what; standard modes and features are supported. Get it and get involved!. Start by getting the code, building it, and; playing with it. This will show you the sorts of things we can do; today and will let you have the ""Clang experience"" first hand: hopefully; it will ""resonate"" with you. :); Once you've done that, please consider getting; involved in the Clang community. The Clang developers include numerous; volunteer contributors with a variety of backgrounds. If you're; interested in; following the development of Clang, signing up for a mailing list is a good; way to learn about how the project works.

Performance,"ing. It is relatively easy to compile a macro, either as a pre-compiled; library to load into ROOT, or as a stand-alone application, by adding; some include statements for header file or some ""dressing code"" to any; macro. ## General Remarks on ROOT macros ##. If you have a number of lines which you were able to execute at the ROOT; prompt, they can be turned into a ROOT macro by giving them a name which; corresponds to the file name without extension. The general structure; for a macro stored in file `MacroName.C` is. ``` {.cpp}; void MacroName() {; < ...; your lines of C++ code; ... >; }; ```. The macro is executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > root MacroName.C; ```. at the system prompt, or executed using `.x`. ``` {.cpp}; > root; root [0] .x MacroName.C; ```. at the ROOT prompt. or it can be loaded into a ROOT session and then; be executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; root [0].L MacroName.C; root [1] MacroName();; ```. at the ROOT prompt. Note that more than one macro can be loaded this; way, as each macro has a unique name in the ROOT name space. A small set; of options can help making your plot nicer. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->SetStyle(""Plain""); // set plain TStyle; gStyle->SetOptStat(111111); // draw statistics on plots,; // (0) for no output; gStyle->SetOptFit(1111); // draw fit results on plot,; // (0) for no ouput; gStyle->SetPalette(57); // set color map; gStyle->SetOptTitle(0); // suppress title box; ...; ```. Next, you should create a canvas for graphical output, with size,; subdivisions and format suitable to your needs, see documentation of; class `TCanvas`:. ``` {.cpp}; TCanvas c1(""c1"",""<Title>"",0,0,400,300); // create a canvas, specify position and size in pixels; c1.Divide(2,2); //set subdivisions, called pads; c1.cd(1); //change to pad 1 of canvas c1; ```. These parts of a well-written macro are pretty standard, and you should; remember to include pieces of code like in the examples above to make; sure your plots always look as you had intended.

Performance,"ing; `RooFit` classes as well as custom implementations you might be using. ### Native and proxy-based importers and exporters. `RooFitHS3` allows to different types of importers and exporters:; *Native* implementations, and *proxy-based* ones. If for a certain; class several implementations are provided, the native; implementation(s) take precedence. ### Writing your own importers and exporters: Proxy-based. Proxy-based implementations can be added very easily and without; actually writing any `C++` code -- you only need to add a short item; to a list in a `JSON` file, namely the; [export keys](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsexportkeys.json); for an exporter, or the; [factory expressions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsfactoryexpressions.json); for an importer. This works in the following way: Every `RooFit` class performs; dependency tracking via proxies, which have names. This can be; exploited to perform the mapping of proxy names to `json` keys upon; export. In the other direction, the `RooWorkspace` has a factory; interface that allows to call any constructor via a string; interface. Hence:; - If a `RooFit` class has no other members aside from proxies, it can; be exported using a set of `export keys`.; - If all relevant members to a `RooFit` class are passed as; constructor arguments, it can be imported using a `factory; expression`. For the importer, an entry in the; [factory expressions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsfactoryexpressions.json); needs to be added as follows:. ``` {.json}; ""<json-key>"": {; ""class"": ""<C++ class name>"",; ""arguments"": [; ""<json-key of constructor argument #1>"",; ""<json-key of constructor argument #2>"",; ...; ]; }; ```. Similarly, for the exporter, an entry in the; [export keys](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/etc/RooFitHS3_wsexportkeys.json); needs to be added as follows:. ``` {.json}; ""<C++ class name>"": {; ""typ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md:3058,perform,perform,3058,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,1,['perform'],['perform']

This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm.

No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward.

A.h,; potentially only part of the descriptor of libA, expands to more than 26000; lines of code. ```cpp; // Main.cpp; #include ""A.h""; int main() {; do();; return 0;; }. ```; Main.cpp, reuses code from libA by including libA's descriptor and links against; libA. The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt.

Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load).

Performance,"instead of enumerating the libraries by hand; allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT; library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,; fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core; libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`.; If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically.; For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all; libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent; libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency; graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and; `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and; the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,; by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of; the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or; equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not.

Performance,"instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible.

In the above, the values of `v` and `a` are clearly expressed, as are the; temporary values for `await_counter` (`class_await_counter_1` and; `class_await_counter_2`) and `std::suspend_always` (; `struct_std__suspend_always_0` and `struct_std__suspend_always_3`). The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`.

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA.

Performance,"into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A ""little endian"" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A ""big endian"" layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction.

RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation), but to; fully use vector extensions of modern CPUs, a manual compilation of ROOT was necessary, setting the required compiler flags. Now, RooFit comes with dedicated computation libraries, each compiled for a specific CPU architecture. When RooFit is loaded for the; first time, ROOT inspects the CPU capabilities, and loads the fastest supported version of this computation library.; This means that RooFit can now use vector extensions such as AVX2 without being recompiled, which enables a speed up of up to 4x for certain computations.; Combined with better data access patterns (~3x speed up, ROOT 6.20), computations with optimised PDFs speed up between 4x and 16x. The fast `BatchMode` now also works in combination with multi processing (`NumCPU`) and with binned data (`RooDataHist`).

This also makes it simpler to setup a; lazy-save mechanism for calls to private-ZA functions (i.e. functions that may; either directly or indirectly clobber ZA state). For the purpose of handling functions marked with ``aarch64_pstate_za_new``,; we have introduced a new LLVM IR pass (SMEABIPass) that is run just before; SelectionDAG. Any such functions dealt with by this pass are marked with; ``aarch64_expanded_pstate_za``. Setting up a lazy-save; ----------------------. Committing a lazy-save; ----------------------.

The predicate-as-counter type represents the type of a predicate-as-counter; value held in a AArch64 SVE predicate register. Such a value contains; information about the number of active lanes, the element width and a bit that; tells whether the generated mask should be inverted. ACLE intrinsics should be; used to move the predicate-as-counter value to/from a predicate vector. There are certain limitations on the type:. * The type can be used for function parameters and return values. * The supported LLVM operations on this type are limited to ``load``, ``store``,; ``phi``, ``select`` and ``alloca`` instructions. The predicate-as-counter type is a scalable type. :Syntax:. ::. target(""aarch64.svcount""). 5.

A note about Floating Point Constant Evaluation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, the only place floating point operations are guaranteed to be evaluated; during translation is in the initializers of variables of static storage; duration, which are all notionally initialized before the program begins; executing (and thus before a non-default floating point environment can be; entered). But C++ has many more contexts where floating point constant; evaluation occurs. Specifically: for static/thread-local variables,; first try evaluating the initializer in a constant context, including in the; constant floating point environment (just like in C), and then, if that fails,; fall back to emitting runtime code to perform the initialization (which might; in general be in a different floating point environment). Consider this example when compiled with ``-frounding-math``. .. code-block:: console. constexpr float func_01(float x, float y) {; return x + y;; }; float V1 = func_01(1.0F, 0x0.000001p0F);. The C++ rule is that initializers for static storage duration variables are; first evaluated during translation (therefore, in the default rounding mode),; and only evaluated at runtime (and therefore in the runtime rounding mode) if; the compile-time evaluation fails. This is in line with the C rules;; C11 F.8.5 says: *All computation for automatic initialization is done (as if); at execution time; thus, it is affected by any operative modes and raises; floating-point exceptions as required by IEC 60559 (provided the state for the; FENV_ACCESS pragma is ‘‘on’’).

Performance,"ion outside atomic; ===========================. The basic ``'load'`` and ``'store'`` allow a variety of optimizations, but can; lead to undefined results in a concurrent environment; see `NotAtomic`_. This; section specifically goes into the one optimizer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions.

For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately.

Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline.

The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document.

Performance,"ion"". Here are a few observations about this:. First, you're right that LLVM does lose information. For example, as of; this writing, there is no way to distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an; SSA-value came from a C ""int"" or a C ""long"" on an ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does.

How to implement cmpValues?; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; *Association* is a case of equality for us. We just treat such values as equal,; but, in general, we need to implement antisymmetric relation. As mentioned; above, to understand what is *less*, we can use order in which we; meet values. If both values have the same order in a function (met at the same; time), we then treat values as *associated*. Otherwise – it depends on who was; first. Every time we run the top-level compare method, we initialize two identical; maps (one for the left side, another one for the right side):. ``map<Value, int> sn_mapL, sn_mapR;``. The key of the map is the *Value* itself, the *value* – is its order (call it; *serial number*). To add value *V* we need to perform the next procedure:. ``sn_map.insert(std::make_pair(V, sn_map.size()));``.

For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` is the; following:. ::. !foo; !!2; !_Z3barv. will place the machine basic block with ``id 2`` in function ``foo`` in a; unique section. It will also place all basic blocks of functions ``bar``; in unique sections. Further, section clusters can also be specified using the ``list=<arg>``; option.

Basic block sections allow the linker to reorder basic blocks and enables; link-time optimizations like whole program inter-procedural basic block; reordering.

Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling.

Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation.

Performance,"ion; =================================================. Clang provides a mechanism for selectively disabling optimizations in functions; and methods. To disable optimizations in a single function definition, the GNU-style or C++11; non-standard attribute ``optnone`` can be used. .. code-block:: c++. // The following functions will not be optimized.; // GNU-style attribute; __attribute__((optnone)) int foo() {; // ... code; }; // C++11 attribute; [[clang::optnone]] int bar() {; // ... code; }. To facilitate disabling optimization for a range of function definitions, a; range-based pragma is provided. Its syntax is ``#pragma clang optimize``; followed by ``off`` or ``on``. All function definitions in the region between an ``off`` and the following; ``on`` will be decorated with the ``optnone`` attribute unless doing so would; conflict with explicit attributes already present on the function (e.g. the; ones that control inlining). .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang optimize off; // This function will be decorated with optnone.; int foo() {; // ... code; }. // optnone conflicts with always_inline, so bar() will not be decorated.; __attribute__((always_inline)) int bar() {; // ... code; }; #pragma clang optimize on. If no ``on`` is found to close an ``off`` region, the end of the region is the; end of the compilation unit. Note that a stray ``#pragma clang optimize on`` does not selectively enable; additional optimizations when compiling at low optimization levels. This feature; can only be used to selectively disable optimizations. The pragma has an effect on functions only at the point of their definition; for; function templates, this means that the state of the pragma at the point of an; instantiation is not necessarily relevant. Consider the following example:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T> T twice(T t) {; return 2 * t;; }. #pragma clang optimize off; template<typename T> T thrice(T t) {; return 3 * t;; }. int container(int a, int b) {; return twice(a) + ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:159477,optimiz,optimize,159477,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']

Together with :ref:`deoptimization operand bundles <deopt_opbundles>`,; ``@llvm.experimental.widenable.condition`` allows frontends to; express guards or checks on optimistic assumptions made during; compilation and represent them as branch instructions on special; conditions.

This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```.

Front-ends must honour; these restrictions when generating LLVM IR. Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not. If we let the compiler insert the appropriate ``smstart``; and ``smstop`` instructions around call boundaries, then the effects on SVE; state can be mitigated. By limiting the state changes to a very brief window; around the call we can control how the operations are scheduled and how live; values remain preserved between state transitions. In order to control PSTATE.SM at this level of granularity, we use function and; callsite attributes rather than intrinsics. Restrictions on attributes; --------------------------. * It is undefined behaviour to pass or return (pointers to) scalable vector; objects to/from functions which may use a different SVE vector length.; This includes functions with a non-streaming interface, but marked with; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` and ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_preserved``. * It is not allowed for a function to be decorated with both; ``aarch64_pstate_za_new`` and ``aarch64_pstate_za_shared``.

Since; this is a **`TObject`**'s method, every object may be ""drawn"", which; means attached to a pad. When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object; that derives from **`TObject`** has a `Paint()` method. It may be empty,; but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to; paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of; objects it owns, it will call successively the `Paint()` method of each; object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen.

Performance,"is document covers how to integrate LLVM into a compiler for a language which; supports garbage collection. **Note that LLVM itself does not provide a; garbage collector.** You must provide your own. Quick Start; ============. First, you should pick a collector strategy. LLVM includes a number of built; in ones, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to know about) in your generated IR, so that LLVM can encode them into; your final stack maps.

The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending on the number of classes bound, across how many; modules, what use fraction, etc.), this initial cost is recouped when; compared to other binders.; As a rule of thumb, if about 10% of classes are used, it takes several; hundreds of bound classes before the cppyy-approach is beneficial.; In High Energy Physics, from which it originated, cppyy is regularly used in; software stacks of many thousands of classes, where this advantage is very; important. `Distributing headers`; ----------------------. cppyy requires C/C++ headers to be available at run-time, which was never a; problem in the developer-centric world from which it originated: software; always had supported C++ APIs already, made available through header files,; and Python simply piggy-backed onto those.; JIT-ing code in those headers, which potentially picked up system headers; that were configured",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:9015,load,loading,9015,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['load'],['loading']

In this example, the definition of the template function ``twice`` is outside; the pragma region, whereas the definition of ``thrice`` is inside the region.; The ``container`` function is also in the region and will not be optimized, but; it causes the instantiation of ``twice`` and ``thrice`` with an ``int`` type; of; these two instantiations, ``twice`` will be optimized (because its definition; was outside the region) and ``thrice`` will not be optimized. Clang also implements MSVC's range-based pragma,; ``#pragma optimize(""[optimization-list]"", on | off)``. At the moment, Clang only; supports an empty optimization list, whereas MSVC supports the arguments, ``s``,; ``g``, ``t``, and ``y``. Currently, the implementation of ``pragma optimize`` behaves; the same as ``#pragma clang optimize``.

Performance,"is increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer. Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view. Our goal is to take advantage of tight; integration between the linker and the optimizer by sharing this information; during various linking phases. Phase 1 : Read LLVM Bitcode Files; ---------------------------------. The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table.

This pragma can only appear at file scope or; at the start of a compound statement (excluding comments). When using within a; compound statement, the pragma is active within the scope of the compound; statement. Currently, the following settings can be controlled with this pragma:. ``#pragma clang fp reassociate`` allows control over the reassociation; of floating point expressions. When enabled, this pragma allows the expression; ``x + (y + z)`` to be reassociated as ``(x + y) + z``.; Reassociation can also occur across multiple statements.; This pragma can be used to disable reassociation when it is otherwise; enabled for the translation unit with the ``-fassociative-math`` flag.; The",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:169419,optimiz,optimization,169419,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The model prevents dereferencing a; ``__terminated_by`` pointer beyond its end. Calculating the location of the end; (i.e., the address of the sentinel value), requires reading the entire array in; memory and would have some performance costs.

Load/Store Unit and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``-noalias`` is the; only option).

This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:11622,optimiz,optimize,11622,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']

Performance,"is solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate. If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ]; ret i32 %X.01; }. The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases.

Performance,"is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores. However, as most stores aren't interesting and don't; inherently leak data, this is expected to be prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details. There are a number of complex details impacting the implementation of this; technique, both on a particular architecture and within a particular compiler.; We discuss proposed implementation techniques for the x86 architecture and the; LLVM compiler. These are primarily to serve as an example, as other; implementation techniques are very possible. ### x86 Implementation Details. On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These cond",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15206,load,loads,15206,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']

For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm. Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper(",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:59933,optimiz,optimization,59933,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3.

Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process. For instance,; if we used the regular ``DeclContext::lookup()`` to find the existing; declarations in the ""to"" context then the ``lookup()`` call itself would; initiate a new import while we are in the middle of importing a declaration!; (By the time we initiate the lookup we haven't registered yet that we already; started to import the node of the ""from"" context.)

This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes; can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed.; Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation; stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes; may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible; once volumes were defined based on it. The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are; performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific; algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note; that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry.; However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; ```.

If no match is found, and the type sought is an integer type, then; the smallest integer type that is larger than the bitwidth of the; sought type is used.

For example,; given the default specifications above, the i7 type will use the; alignment of i8 (next largest) while both i65 and i256 will use the; alignment of i64 (largest specified). The function of the data layout string may not be what you expect.; Notably, this is not a specification from the frontend of what alignment; the code generator should use. Instead, if specified, the target data layout is required to match what; the ultimate *code generator* expects.

Performance,"it and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``-noalias`` is the; only option). Essentially, there is no option to specify a different memory; type (e.g., write-back, write-combining, write-through; etc.) and consequently; to weaken, or strengthen, the memory model. Other limitations are:. * The LSUnit does not know when store-to-load forwarding may occur.; * The LSUnit does not know anything about cache hierarchy and memory types.; * The LSUnit does not know how to identify serializing operations and memory; fences.

Although we tend to talk about them as distinct passes, it should be noted that; there's a good deal of flexibility here and it's ok for things to happen; earlier than described below. For example, it's not unusual for the legalizer to; legalize an intrinsic directly to a target instruction. The concrete; requirement is that the following additional constraints are preserved after; each of these passes:. IRTranslator. The representation must be gMIR, MIR, or a mixture of the two after this pass.; The majority will typically be gMIR to begin with but later passes will; gradually transition the gMIR to MIR. Legalizer. No illegal operations must remain or be introduced after this pass. Register Bank Selector. All virtual registers must have a register bank assigned after this pass. Instruction Select. No gMIR must remain or be introduced after this pass. In other words, we must; have completed the conversion from gMIR to MIR. In addition to these passes, there are also some optional passes that perform; an optimization. The current optional passes are:. Combiner. Replaces patterns of instructions with a better alternative. Typically, this; means improving run time performance by replacing instructions with faster; alternatives but Combiners can also focus on code size or other metrics.

Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction.

Virtual containers are volumes that do not represent real objects, but; they are needed for grouping and positioning together other volumes.; Such grouping helps not only geometry creation, but also optimizes; tracking performance; therefore, it is highly recommended. Virtual; volumes need to inherit material/medium properties from the volume they; are placed into in order to be ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`. What we need to do is to create a virtual container volume `C`; holding `A` and `B`, then position `C` in the other volumes. Note that `C` is a volume having a determined medium. Since it is not a; real volume, we need to manually set its medium the same as that of; `D,E` or `F` in order to make it ‘invisible' (same physics properties).; In other words, the limitation in proceeding this way is that `D,E,` and; `F` must point to the same medium. If this was not the case, we would; have to define different virtual volumes for each placement: `C`, `C'`; and `C""`, having the same shape but different media matching the; corresponding conta",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:69850,optimiz,optimizes,69850,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimizes', 'performance']"

RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject begins by creating an ObjectImage instance; from the ObjectBuffer it received. ObjectImage, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and; an external symbol relocation map. .. image:: MCJIT-load-object.png.

In order to allow removing unused function pointers from vtables, we need to; know whether every virtual call which could use it is known to the compiler, or; whether another translation unit could introduce more calls through the vtable.; This is not the same as the linkage of the vtable, because call sites could be; using a pointer of a more widely-visible base class. For example, consider this; code:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((visibility(""default""))); struct A {; virtual void f();; };. __attribute__((visibility(""hidden""))); struct B : A {; virtual void f();; };. With LTO, we know that all code which can see the declaration of ``B`` is; visible to us. However, a pointer to a ``B`` could be cast to ``A*`` and passed; to another linkage unit, which could then call ``f`` on it. This call would; load from the vtable for ``B`` (using the object pointer), and then call; ``B::f``. This means we can't remove the function pointer from ``B``'s vtable,; or the implementation of ``B::f``. However, if we can see all code which knows; about any dynamic base class (which would be the case if ``B`` only inherited; from classes with hidden visibility), then this optimisation would be valid.

It could be possible to define ``DW_OP_plus``, ``DW_OP_plus_uconst``, and; ``DW_OP_minus`` to operate on location descriptions to avoid needing; ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset_uconst``. However, this is not; proposed since currently the arithmetic operations are defined to require values; of the same base type and produces a result with the same base type. Allowing; these operations to act on location descriptions would permit the first operand; to be a location description and the second operand to be an integral value; type, or vice versa, and return a location description. This complicates the; rules for implicit conversions between default address space memory location; descriptions and generic base type values. Currently the rules would convert; such a location description to the memory address value and then perform two's; compliment wrap around arithmetic. If the result was used as a location; description, it would be implicitly converted back to a default address space; memory location description. This is different to the overflow rules on location; descriptions. To allow control, an operation that converts a memory location; description to an address integral type value would be required.

The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. The second operand is the alignment of the source location. It must be a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the base pointer and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.load``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked loads and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar load operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a regular vector load instruction followed by a 'select' between the loaded",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:844099,load,load,844099,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"its hold?. There are three (interesting) possible answers: undefined, zero extended, or; sign extended. The number of bits in question depends on the data-type that; the front-end is referencing (typically i1/i8/i16/i32). Knowing the answer to this is important for two reasons: 1) we want to be able; to implement the ABI correctly. If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Currently, these sorts of things are modelled by compiling a function to return; the small type and a signext/zeroext marker is used. For example, we compile; Z into:. define i32 @z() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call signext i16 (...)* @y() nounwind; 	%1 = sext i16 %0 to i32; 	ret i32 %1; }. and b into:. define signext i16 @b() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call i32 (...)* @a() nounwind		; <i32> [#uses=1]; 	%retval12 = trunc i32 %0 to i16		; <i16> [#uses=1]; 	ret i16 %retval12; }.

Performance,"its, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``; ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence which instruction is best to use). ..

Performance,"ivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps.

While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```.

Whether threads are *converged* or not depends on the paths they take; through the control flow graph. Threads take different outgoing edges; at a *divergent branch*. Divergent branches constrain; program transforms such as changing the CFG or moving a convergent; operation to a different point of the CFG. Performing these; transformations across a divergent branch can change the sets of; threads that execute convergent operations convergently. While these; constraints are out of scope for this document, the described; *uniformity analysis* allows these transformations to identify; uniform branches where these constraints do not hold. Convergence and; uniformity are inter-dependent: When threads diverge at a divergent; branch, they may later *reconverge* at a common program point.; Subsequent operations are performed convergently, but the inputs may; be non-uniform, thus producing divergent outputs. Uniformity is also useful by itself on targets that execute threads in; groups with shared execution resources (e.g. waves, warps, or; subgroups):. - Uniform outputs can potentially be computed or stored on shared; resources.; - These targets must ""linearize"" a divergent branch to ensure that; each side of the branch is followed by the corresponding threads in; the same group.

If needed, you can explicitly destroy a ROOT object that you own through; its associated **`TClass`**:. ``` {.cpp}; myobject.IsA().Destructor(myobject); ```. which will send out the deletion notification to the system (thus you do; not need to care anymore at this point about Python reference counting,; the object will go, even if it's reference count it non-zero), and free; the memory. ### Performance. The performance of `PyROOT` when programming with ROOT in Python is; similar to that of Cling. Differences occur mainly because of differences; in the respective languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once; parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to; ROOT are typically faster from `PyROOT`, whereas loops are typically; slower. When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider; performance generally ""good enough"" on the outset, and when it turns out; that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs.

You gain; space on the file, and you do not loose functionality if you do not use; the `fBits` and `fUniqueID. `See ""The Role of TObject"" on the use of; `fBits` and `fUniqueID`. ### Streaming a TClonesArray. When writing a **`TClonesArray`** it bypasses by default the; `Streamer `of the member class and uses a more efficient internal; mechanism to write the members to the file. You can override the default; and specify that the member class `Streamer `is used by setting the; `TClonesArray::BypassStreamer` bit to false:. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray *fTracks;; fTracks->BypassStreamer(kFALSE); // use the member Streamer; ```. When the `kBypassStreamer` bit is set, the automatically generated; `Streamer `can call directly the method **`TClass::WriteBuffer`**.; Bypassing the `Streamer` improves the performance when writing/reading; the objects in the **`TClonesArray`**. However, the drawback is when a; **`TClonesArray`** is written with `split=0` bypassing the `Streamer`,; the `StreamerInfo `of the class in the array being optimized, one cannot; later use the **`TClonesArray`** with `split > 0`. For example, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`.

Performance,"jectLayer to link the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

For sake of discussion, I'm going to assume that you are debugging a; transformation invoked by :program:`opt`, although nothing described here; depends on that.

First thing you do is start gdb on the opt process:. .. code-block:: console. $ gdb opt; GNU gdb 5.0; Copyright 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.; GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are; welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.; Type ""show copying"" to see the conditions.; There is absolutely no warranty for GDB. Type ""show warranty"" for details.; This GDB was configured as ""sparc-sun-solaris2.6""...; (gdb). Note that :program:`opt` has a lot of debugging information in it, so it takes; time to load. Be patient. Since we cannot set a breakpoint in our pass yet; (the shared object isn't loaded until runtime), we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb).

Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"".

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`. To do the same from `TTree::CopyEntries` add to the option string ""cachesize=SIZE"". To update the size of the cache or disable it from `hadd`, use the command line option `-cachesize SIZE`. `SIZE` shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in 'human readable form' (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. ### Other Changes. * Update `TChain::LoadTree` so that the user call back routine is actually called for each input file even those containing `TTree` objects with no entries.; * Repair setting the branch address of a leaflist style branch taking directly the address of the struct.

A mismatch of features may result in incorrect; execution, or a reduction in performance. The target features supported by each processor is listed in; :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`.

Performance,"ker symbols*.; All cppyy uses, the basic and the more advanced, are variations on the; theme of bringing these two together at the point of use. Definitions typically live in header files and symbols in libraries.; Headers can be loaded with ``cppyy.include`` and libraries with the; ``cppyy.load_library`` call.; Loading the header is sufficient to start exploring, with ``cppyy.gbl`` the; starting point of all things C++, while the linker symbols are only needed at ; the point of first use. Here is an example using the `zlib`_ library, which is likely available on; your system:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('zlib.h') # bring in C++ definitions; >>> cppyy.load_library('libz') # load linker symbols; >>> cppyy.gbl.zlibVersion() # use a zlib API; '1.2.11'; >>>. Since header files can include other header files, it is easy to aggregate; all relevant ones into a single header to include.; If there are project-specific include paths, you can add those paths through; ``cppyy.add_include_path``.; If a header is C-only and not set for use with C++, use ``cppyy.c_include``,; which adds ``extern ""C""`` around the header. Library files can be aggregated by linking all relevant ones to a single; library to load.; Using the linker for this purpose allows regular system features such as; ``rpath`` and envars such as ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to be applied as usual.; Note that any mechanism that exposes the library symbols will work.; For example, you could also use the standard module ``ctypes`` through; ``ctypes.CDLL`` with the ``ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL`` option. To explore, start from ``cppyy.gbl`` to access your namespaces, classes,; functions, etc., etc. directly; or use python's ``dir`` (or tab-completion); to see what is available.; Use python's ``help`` to see list the methods and data members of classes and; see the interfaces of functions.

Performance,"l %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels.

The case where the pointer is actually null (i.e. the ""failing""; case) is extremely rare. 2. The failing path heals the implicit null check into an explicit; null check so that the application does not repeatedly page; fault.

This stage (in conjunction with the Translate stage) turns the tree; of Actions into a list of actual subprocess to run. Conceptually, the; driver performs a top down matching to assign Action(s) to Tools. The; ToolChain is responsible for selecting the tool to perform a; particular action; once selected the driver interacts with the tool; to see if it can match additional actions (for example, by having an; integrated preprocessor). Once Tools have been selected for all actions, the driver determines; how the tools should be connected (for example, using an inprocess; module, pipes, temporary files, or user provided filenames). If an; output file is required, the driver also computes the appropriate; file name (the suffix and file location depend on the input types and; options such as ``-save-temps``). The driver interacts with a ToolChain to perform the Tool bindings.; Each ToolChain contains information about all the tools needed for; compilation for a particular architecture, platform, and operating; system.

Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``).

More aggressive unrolling and; inlining also promote other optimizations, such as constant propagation and; SROA, which sometimes speed up code by over 10x.

Performance,"l. ## Status and usage. **Status**: Experimental work in progress. Enabling is strongly advised against; except for development and testing. **Enable in Clang**: `-Xclang -fexperimental-assignment-tracking`. That causes Clang to get LLVM to run the pass `declare-to-assign`. The pass; converts conventional debug intrinsics to assignment tracking metadata and sets; the module flag `debug-info-assignment-tracking` to the value `i1 true`. To; check whether assignment tracking is enabled for a module call; `isAssignmentTrackingEnabled(const Module &M)` (from `llvm/IR/DebugInfo.h`). ## Design and implementation. ### Assignment markers: `llvm.dbg.assign`. `llvm.dbg.value`, a conventional debug intrinsic, marks out a position in the; IR where a variable takes a particular value. Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment. That way, the position of the; store and marker can be considered together when making that choice. Another; important benefit of referring to the store is that we can then build a two-way; mapping of stores<->markers that can be used to find markers that need to be; updated when stores are modified. An `llvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```.

As a practical consideration, many garbage-collected systems allow code that is; collector-aware (""managed code"") to call code that is not collector-aware; (""unmanaged code"").

Furthermore, it is common that coordinating the transition from; managed to unmanaged code requires extra code generation at the call site to; inform the collector of the transition. In order to support these needs, a; statepoint may be marked as a GC transition, and data that is necessary to; perform the transition (if any) may be provided as additional arguments to the; statepoint. Note that although in many cases statepoints may be inferred to be GC; transitions based on the function symbols involved (e.g. a call from a; function with GC strategy ""foo"" to a function with GC strategy ""bar""),; indirect calls that are also GC transitions must also be supported. This; requirement is the driving force behind the decision to require that GC; transitions are explicitly marked.

Performance,"lISel <https://llvm.org/docs/GlobalISel/index.html>`_ is another; instruction selection framework. .. _SelectionDAG:. Introduction to SelectionDAGs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SelectionDAG provides an abstraction for code representation in a way that; is amenable to instruction selection using automatic techniques; (e.g. dynamic-programming based optimal pattern matching selectors). It is also; well-suited to other phases of code generation; in particular, instruction; scheduling (SelectionDAG's are very close to scheduling DAGs post-selection).; Additionally, the SelectionDAG provides a host representation where a large; variety of very-low-level (but target-independent) `optimizations`_ may be; performed; ones which require extensive information about the instructions; efficiently supported by the target. The SelectionDAG is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph whose nodes are instances of the; ``SDNode`` class. The primary payload of the ``SDNode`` is its operation code; (Opcode) that indicates what operation the node performs and the operands to the; operation. The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow depende",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:34395,perform,performs,34395,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['perform'],['performs']

The mem2reg pass implements the standard ""iterated dominance frontier""; algorithm for constructing SSA form and has a number of optimizations; that speed up (very common) degenerate cases. The mem2reg optimization; pass is the answer to dealing with mutable variables, and we highly; recommend that you depend on it. Note that mem2reg only works on; variables in certain circumstances:. #. mem2reg is alloca-driven: it looks for allocas and if it can handle; them, it promotes them. It does not apply to global variables or heap; allocations.; #. mem2reg only looks for alloca instructions in the entry block of the; function. Being in the entry block guarantees that the alloca is only; executed once, which makes analysis simpler.; #. mem2reg only promotes allocas whose uses are direct loads and stores.; If the address of the stack object is passed to a function, or if any; funny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers. Note that the ""sroa"" pass is; more powerful and can promote structs, ""unions"", and arrays in many; cases. All of these properties are easy to satisfy for most imperative; languages, and we'll illustrate it below with Kaleidoscope. The final; question you may be asking is: should I bother with this nonsense for my; front-end?

Performance,"lable on Haswell and; Zen processors, there is an instruction for shifting that does not set any; flags: `shrx`. We can use this and the `lea` instruction to implement analogous; code sequences to the above ones. However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions. Fast, single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shrxq %rax, %rsi, %rsi # Shift away bits if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:34575,load,loads,34575,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,"['load', 'optimiz']","['loads', 'optimize']"

If ``callees``; metadata is attached to a call site, and any callee is not among the set of; functions provided by the metadata, the behavior is undefined. The intent of; this metadata is to facilitate optimizations such as indirect-call promotion.; For example, in the code below, the call instruction may only target the; ``add`` or ``sub`` functions:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = call i64 %binop(i64 %x, i64 %y), !callees !0. ...; !0 = !{ptr @add, ptr @sub}.

It converges faster than the awmi; algorithm, however, it is not suitable to fit large number of parameters. ## 1-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRA. The quantity to be minimized in the fitting procedure for one-dimensional spectrum is defined as. $$ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{N-M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{[y_i-f(i,a)]^2}{y_i} $$. where `i` is the channel in the fitted spectrum, `N` is the number of; channels in the fitting subregion, `M` is the number of free parameters,; `y_i` is the content of the `i`-th channel, `a` is a vector of the; parameters being fitted and `f(i,a)` is a fitting or peak shape function. Instead of the weighting coefficient `y_i` in the denominator of the formula; given above, one can use also the value of `f(i,a)`. It is suitable for; data with poor statistics [11], [12]. The third statistic to be optimized, which is implemented in the fitting; functions, is the Maximum Likelihood Method. It is up to the user; to select a suitable statistic.

Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```.

To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores.

A method is in a certain method family if:. * it has a ``objc_method_family`` attribute placing it in that family; or if; not that,; * it does not have an ``objc_method_family`` attribute placing it in a; different or no family, and; * its selector falls into the corresponding selector family, and; * its signature obeys the added restrictions of the method family. A selector is in a certain selector family if, ignoring any leading; underscores, the first component of the selector either consists entirely of; the name of the method family or it begins with that name followed by a; character other than a lowercase letter. For example, ``_perform:with:`` and; ``performWith:`` would fall into the ``perform`` family (if we recognized one),; but ``performing:with`` would not.

In all these cases `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` returns kNone, as it does; for successful addition, indicating it does not require further; information about this object. Hence you should not try to make any; assumptions about what the viewer did with the object. The viewer may; decide to force the client to rebuild (republish) the scene, obtaining a; different collection of objects, if the internal viewer state changes; .e.g. significant camera move.

Like SmallVector's, the big downside to SmallString is their sizeof. While they; are optimized for small strings, they themselves are not particularly small.; This means that they work great for temporary scratch buffers on the stack, but; should not generally be put into the heap: it is very rare to see a SmallString; as the member of a frequently-allocated heap data structure or returned; by-value. .. _dss_stdstring:. std::string; ^^^^^^^^^^^. The standard C++ std::string class is a very general class that (like; SmallString) owns its underlying data. sizeof(std::string) is very reasonable; so it can be embedded into heap data structures and returned by-value. On the; other hand, std::string is highly inefficient for inline editing (e.g.; concatenating a bunch of stuff together) and because it is provided by the; standard library, its performance characteristics depend a lot of the host; standard library (e.g. libc++ and MSVC provide a highly optimized string class,; GCC contains a really slow implementation). The major disadvantage of std::string is that almost every operation that makes; them larger can allocate memory, which is slow. As such, it is better to use; SmallVector or Twine as a scratch buffer, but then use std::string to persist; the result. .. _ds_set:.

Trivial instructions between the call and return do not prevent the; transformation from taking place, though currently the analysis cannot; support moving any really useful instructions (only dead ones).; #. This pass transforms functions that are prevented from being tail recursive; by an associative expression to use an accumulator variable, thus compiling; the typical naive factorial or fib implementation into efficient code.; #. TRE is performed if the function returns void, if the return returns the; result returned by the call, or if the function returns a run-time constant; on all exits from the function. It is possible, though unlikely, that the; return returns something else (like constant 0), and can still be TRE'd. It; can be TRE'd if *all other* return instructions in the function return the; exact same value.; #.

Performance,"le conditional jump instructions; that use the same flags but handle different conditions. Naively, we could; consider each fallthrough between them an ""edge"" but this causes a much more; complex control flow graph. Instead, we accumulate the set of conditions; necessary for fallthrough and use a sequence of `cmovCC` instructions in a; single fallthrough edge to track it. Second, we trade register pressure for simpler `cmovCC` instructions by; allocating a register for the ""bad"" state. We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:22413,load,loads,22413,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']
Performance,"le gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++; compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is; very hard to do in a performance-portable way. In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization; paths, which drives its performance.; For example, basic inheritance sequentially lines up classes, whereas; multiple (virtual) inheritance usually requires thunks.; Thus, when calling base class methods on a derived instance, the latter; requires offset calculations that depend on that instance, whereas the former; has fixed offsets fully determined by the class definitions themselves.; By labeling classes appropriately, single inheritance classes (by far the; most common case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:2650,perform,performance-portable,2650,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['perform'],['performance-portable']

Performance,"le. But it may produce surprising results if the; debugging code depends on consistent use of ``NDEBUG`` also in other translation units. Definitions consistency; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C++ language defines that same declarations in different translation units should have; the same definition, as known as ODR (One Definition Rule). Prior to modules, the translation; units don't dependent on each other and the compiler itself can't perform a strong; ODR violation check. With the introduction of modules, now the compiler have; the chance to perform ODR violations with language semantics across translation units. However, in the practice, we found the existing ODR checking mechanism is not stable; enough. Many people suffers from the false positive ODR violation diagnostics, AKA,; the compiler are complaining two identical declarations have different definitions; incorrectly. Also the true positive ODR violations are rarely reported.; Also we learned that MSVC don't perform ODR check for declarations in the global module; fragment. So in order to get better user experience, save the time checking ODR and keep consistent; behavior with MSVC, we disabled the ODR check for the declarations in the global module; fragment by default. Users who want more strict check can still use the; ``-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf`` flag to get the ODR check enabled. It is also; encouraged to report issues if users find false positive ODR violations or false negative ODR; violations with the flag enabled. ABI Impacts; -----------. The declarations in a module unit which are not in the global module fragment have new linkage names. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. export module M;; namespace NS {; export int foo();; }. The linkage name of ``NS::foo()`` would be ``_ZN2NSW1M3fooEv``.; This couldn't be demangled by previous versions of the debugger or demangler.; As of LLVM 15.x, users can utilize ``llvm-cxxfilt`` to demangle this:. .. code-block:: console. $ llvm-cxxfilt _ZN2NSW",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:17773,perform,perform,17773,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

Using the `COL` option with histograms having some negative bins; the empty bins; (containing 0) are drawn. In some cases one wants to not draw empty bins; (containing 0) of histograms having a negative minimum. The option `1`, used with; the option `COL`, allows to do that. Implement the Log option for `CANDLE` plots as requested; [here](https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20225&p=87006#p87006). ### TTeXDump. From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues for the proper line wrapping (this is the one implemented in; this change). ### TLatex.

Performance,"leased after they've been used. A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime.

Performance,"lector, this functionality is restricted to generating machine code; which can interoperate with a collector provided externally. .. _prefixdata:. Prefix Data; -----------. Prefix data is data associated with a function which the code; generator will emit immediately before the function's entrypoint.; The purpose of this feature is to allow frontends to associate; language-specific runtime metadata with specific functions and make it; available through the function pointer while still allowing the; function pointer to be called. To access the data for a given function, a program may bitcast the; function pointer to a pointer to the constant's type and dereference; index -1. This implies that the IR symbol points just past the end of; the prefix data. For instance, take the example of a function annotated; with a single ``i32``,. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @f() prefix i32 123 { ... }. The prefix data can be referenced as,. .. code-block:: llvm. %a = getelementptr inbounds i32, ptr @f, i32 -1; %b = load i32, ptr %a. Prefix data is laid out as if it were an initializer for a global variable; of the prefix data's type. The function will be placed such that the; beginning of the prefix data is aligned. This means that if the size; of the prefix data is not a multiple of the alignment size, the; function's entrypoint will not be aligned.

This; doesn't show up in any symbol table in the object file.; ``internal``; Similar to private, but the value shows as a local symbol; (``STB_LOCAL`` in the case of ELF) in the object file.

From the linker's; perspective, an ``available_externally`` global is equivalent to; an external declaration. They exist to allow inlining and other; optimizations to take place given knowledge of the definition of the; global, which is known to be somewhere outside the module.

Similar functionality is; currently provided by the CLHEP <Vector> and <Geometry> packages and the; ROOT Physics vector classes (See ""Physics Vectors""). It also re-uses; concepts and ideas from the CMS; [Common Vector package](Common Vector package). In contrast to CLHEP or; the ROOT physics libraries, `GenVector` provides class templates for; modeling the vectors. The user can control how the vector is internally; represented. This is expressed by a choice of coordinate system, which; is supplied as a template parameter when the vector is constructed.; Furthermore, each coordinate system is itself a template, so that the; user can specify the underlying scalar type. The `GenVector` classes do not inherit from **`TObject`**, therefore; cannot be used as in the case of the physics vector classes in ROOT; collections. In addition, to optimize performances, no virtual destructors are; provided. In the following paragraphs, the main characteristics of; `GenVector` are described. A more detailed description of all the; `GenVector` classes is available also at; <http://seal.cern.ch/documents/mathlib/GenVector.pdf>. ### Main Characteristics. #### Optimal Runtime Performances. We try to minimize any overhead in the run-time performance. We have; deliberately avoided the use of any virtual function and even virtual; destructors in the classes. In addition, as much as possible functions; are defined as inline. For this reason, we have chosen to use template; classes to implement the `GenVector` concepts instead of abstract or; base classes and virtual functions. It is then recommended to avoid; using the `GenVector` classes polymorphically and developing classes; inheriting from them. #### Points and Vector Concept. Mathematically vectors and points are two distinct concepts. They have; different transformations, as vectors only rotate while po",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:68576,optimiz,optimize,68576,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimize', 'performances']"

On the; other hand, if a1.cpp and b1.cpp both define ""foo"" there is no error (different; dynamic libraries may define the same symbol). If main.cpp refers to ""foo"", it; should bind to the definition in LibA rather than the one in LibB, since; main.cpp is part of the ""main"" dylib, and the main dylib links against LibA; before LibB. Many JIT clients will have no need for this strict adherence to the usual; ahead-of-time linking rules, and should be able to get by just fine by putting; all of their code in a single JITDylib. However, clients who want to JIT code; for languages/projects that traditionally rely on ahead-of-time linking (e.g.; C++) will find that this feature makes life much easier. Symbol lookup in ORC serves two other important functions, beyond providing; addresses for symbols: (1) It triggers compilation of the symbol(s) searched for; (if they have not been compiled already), and (2) it provides the; synchronization mechanism for concurrent compilation. The pseudo-code for the; lookup process is:. .. code-block:: none. construct a query object from a query set and query handler; lock the session; lodge query against requested symbols, collect required materializers (if any); unlock the session; dispatch materializers (if any). In this context a materializer is something that provides a working definition; of a symbol upon request. Usually materializers are just wrappers for compilers,; but they may also wrap a jit-linker directly (if the program representation; backing the definitions is an object file), or may even be a class that writes; bits directly into memory (for example, if the definitions are; stubs). Materialization is the blanket term for any actions (compiling, linking,; splatting bits, registering with runtimes, etc.) that are required to generate a; symbol definition that is safe to",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:9483,concurren,concurrent,9483,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

Performance,"lete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer.

Performance,"lihood fits.; 	These classes are templated on the type of function interface they implement (see later). User convenient typedefs are also provided.; 	They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`. In addition the fitter classes make uses of the generic interfaces for parametric function evaluations, `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`; to define the fit model function and use the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface to perform the minimization of the objective function.; More information about the function interface and the multi-dimensional minimization in ROOT is given in the Mathematical Library chapter. Here we present a detailed description of the `ROOT::Fit` classes and how to use them.; Using these classes instead of the interface provided directly in the ROOT data objects, like `TH1::Fit` allow are more fine control; to configure and customise the fits. For example, using these classes a combined fit of several histograms can be performed. To understand how these class work, let's go through a simple example, such as fitting an histogram. When fitting an histogram, instead of using `TH1::Fit` we will show in the following hot wo use the `ROOT::Fit` classes.; We will show how to perform the following different type of fits with the histogram data:; * a least square fit using the observed errors (Neyman chi-squared);; * a least square fit using the expected errors from the function (Pearson chi-squared);; * a binned likelihood fit;; * an extended unbinned likelihood fits, if the histogram has been set to store in the buffer the original data used to fill it. Let's go through all the steps required for performing these fits using the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class.; These steps are:; 1. Create the input fit data object.; 2. Create the input model function.; 3.

The LSUnit used to conservatively use an; instruction's ""MayLoad"", ""MayStore"", and unmodeled side effects flags to; determine whether an instruction should be treated as a memory-barrier. This was; inaccurate in general and was changed so that now each instruction has an; IsAStoreBarrier and IsALoadBarrier flag. These flags are mca specific and; default to false for every instruction. If any instruction should have either of; these flags set, it should be done within the target's InstrPostProcess class.; For an example, look at the `X86InstrPostProcess::postProcessInstruction` method; within `llvm/lib/Target/X86/MCA/X86CustomBehaviour.cpp`. A load/store barrier consumes one entry of the load/store queue. A load/store; barrier enforces ordering of loads/stores. A younger load cannot pass a load; barrier. Also, a younger store cannot pass a store barrier. A younger load; has to wait for the memory/load barrier to execute. A load/store barrier is; ""executed"" when it becomes the oldest entry in the load/store queue(s). That; also means, by construction, all of the older loads/stores have been executed. In conclusion, the full set of load/store consistency rules are:. #. A store may not pass a previous store.; #. A store may not pass a previous load (regardless of ``-noalias``).; #. A store has to wait until an older store barrier is fully executed.; #. A load may pass a previous load.; #. A load may not pass a previous store unless ``-noalias`` is set.; #.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures.

This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables.

When MCJIT::finalizeObject is called, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations. This function will attempt to locate any; external symbols and then apply all relocations for the object. External symbols are resolved by calling the memory manager's; getPointerToNamedFunction method. The memory manager will return the; address of the requested symbol in the target address space. (Note, this; may not be a valid pointer in the host process.) RuntimeDyld will then; iterate through the list of relocations it has stored which are associated; with this symbol and invoke the resolveRelocation method which, through an; format-specific implementation, will apply the relocation to the loaded; section memory. Next, RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations iterates through the list of; sections and for each section iterates through a list of relocations that; have been saved which reference that symbol and call resolveRelocation for; each entry in this list. The relocation list here is a list of; relocations for which the symbol associated with the relocation is located; in the section associated with the list. Each of these locations will; have a target location at which the relocation will be applied that is; likely located in a different section. .. image:: MCJIT-resolve-relocations.png. Once relocations have been applied as described above, MCJIT calls; RuntimeDyld::getEHFrameSection, and if a non-zero result is returned; passes the section data to the memory manager's registerEHFrames method.; This allows the memory manager to call any desired target-specific; functions, such as registering the EH frame information with a debugger. Finally, MCJIT calls the memory manager's finalizeMemory method. In this; method, the memory manager will invalidate the target code cache, if; necessary, and apply final permissions to the memory pages it has; allocated for code and data memory.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:8607,cache,cache,8607,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero. This has been implemented by Jeromy Tompkins <Tompkins@nscl.msu.edu>. ## Geometry Libraries; A new module geom/vecgeom was introduced to give transparent access to VecGeom ; solid primitives. VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this RO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md:23398,load,loaded,23398,README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v608/index.md,1,['load'],['loaded']

For example,; `GetEntry(12)` loads the 13th event into the event data member of; `MyClass` (note that the first entry is 0). `GetEntry` returns the; number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read; twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case `GetEntry`; returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return; of 0 means an error has occurred while reading. - `Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry)` and `void Notify()` - these two; methods are related to chains. `LoadTree` will load the tree; containing the specified entry from a chain of trees.

For example, in this tutorial our IRTransformLayer calls through to; our IRCompileLayer to compile the transformed IR, and our IRCompileLayer in; turn calls our ObjectLayer to link the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

A **`TEventList`** or a **`TEntryList`** can be used to limit the; **`TTree`** to the events in the list. The methods `SetEventList` and; `SetEntryList` tell the tree to use the list and hence limit all; subsequent calls to `Draw`, `Scan`, `Process`, `Query`, `Principal` and; `CopyTree` methods to the entries in the list. In general, it affects; the `GetEntryNumber` method and all functions using it for looping over; the tree entries. The `GetEntry` and `GetEntries` methods are not; affected. Note, that in the `SetEventList` method, the **`TEventList`**; argument is internally transformed into a **`TEntryList`**, and this; operation, in case of a **`TChain`**, requires loading of all the tree; headers. In this example, we create a list with all entries with more; than 600 tracks and then set it so that the tree will use this list. To; reset the **`TTree`** to use all events use `SetEventList(0)` or; `SetEntryList(0)`. 1. Let's look at an example. First, open the file and draw the; `fNtrack`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] TTree *T = (TTree*)f->Get(""T"");; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack"");; ```. 2. Now, put the entries with over 600 tracks into a **`TEntryList`**; called `myList`. We get the list from the current directory and assign; it to a variable list. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw("">>myList"",""fNtrack > 600"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list=(TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""myList"");; ```. 3. Instruct the tree **`T`** to use the new list and draw it again. Note; that this is exactly the same `Draw` command.

Note that this definition of *""based""* is intentionally similar to the; definition of *""based""* in C99, though it is slightly weaker. LLVM IR does not associate types with memory. The result type of a; ``load`` merely indicates the size and alignment of the memory from; which to load, as well as the interpretation of the value. The first; operand type of a ``store`` similarly only indicates the size and; alignment of the store.

There; are currently two Primary allocators implemented, specific to 32 and 64 bit; architectures. It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of caches. - the Quarantine: offers a way to delay the deallocation operations, preventing; blocks to be immediately available for reuse. Blocks held will be recycled; once certain size criteria are reached. This is essentially a delayed freelist; which can help mitigate some use-after-free situations.

The Root node is; the final side-effecting node in the token chain. For example, in a single basic; block function it would be the return node. One important concept for SelectionDAGs is the notion of a ""legal"" vs.; ""illegal"" DAG. A legal DAG for a target is one that only uses supported; operations and supported types. On a 32-bit PowerPC, for example, a DAG with a; value of type i1, i8, i16, or i64 would be illegal, as would a DAG that uses a; SREM or UREM operation.

Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form.

When an opt-bisect index value refers to an entire invocation of the run; function for a pass, the pass will query whether or not it should be skipped; each time it is invoked and each invocation will be assigned a unique value.; For example, if a FunctionPass is used with a module containing three functions; a different index value will b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst:3620,optimiz,optimization,3620,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OptBisect.rst,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'performed']"

Most importantly, this means that arithmetic operations; on operands of these types are formally performed in the type and produce; values of the type. ``__fp16`` does not follow those rules: most operations; immediately promote operands of type ``__fp16`` to ``float``, and so; arithmetic operations are defined to be performed in ``float`` and so result in; a value of type ``float`` (unless further promoted because of other operands).; See below for more information on the exact specifications of these types.

Performance,"llvm-diff - LLVM structural 'diff'; ==================================. .. program:: llvm-diff. SYNOPSIS; --------. **llvm-diff** [*options*] *module 1* *module 2* [*global name ...*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. **llvm-diff** compares the structure of two LLVM modules, primarily; focusing on differences in function definitions. Insignificant; differences, such as changes in the ordering of globals or in the; names of local values, are ignored. An input module will be interpreted as an assembly file if its name; ends in '.ll'; otherwise it will be read in as a bitcode file. If a list of global names is given, just the values with those names; are compared; otherwise, all global values are compared, and; diagnostics are produced for globals which only appear in one module; or the other. **llvm-diff** compares two functions by comparing their basic blocks,; beginning with the entry blocks. If the terminators seem to match,; then the corresponding successors are compared; otherwise they are; ignored. This algorithm is very sensitive to changes in control flow,; which tend to stop any downstream changes from being detected. **llvm-diff** is intended as a debugging tool for writers of LLVM; passes and frontends. It does not have a stable output format. EXIT STATUS; -----------. If **llvm-diff** finds no differences between the modules, it will exit; with 0 and produce no output. Otherwise it will exit with a non-zero; value. BUGS; ----. Many important differences, like changes in linkage or function; attributes, are not diagnosed. Changes in memory behavior (for example, coalescing loads) can cause; massive detected differences in blocks.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:1602,load,loads,1602,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst,1,['load'],['loads']
Performance,"llvm-exegesis - LLVM Machine Instruction Benchmark; ==================================================. .. program:: llvm-exegesis. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` [*options*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` is a benchmarking tool that uses information available; in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like latency,; throughput, or port decomposition. Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:362,latency,latency,362,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,5,"['latency', 'perform', 'throughput']","['latency', 'performance', 'throughput']"
Performance,"llvm-mca - LLVM Machine Code Analyzer; =====================================. .. program:: llvm-mca. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-mca` [*options*] [input]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-mca` is a performance analysis tool that uses information; available in LLVM (e.g. scheduling models) to statically measure the performance; of machine code in a specific CPU. Performance is measured in terms of throughput as well as processor resource; consumption. The tool currently works for processors with a backend for which; there is a scheduling model available in LLVM. The main goal of this tool is not just to predict the performance of the code; when run on the target, but also help with diagnosing potential performance; issues. Given an assembly code sequence, :program:`llvm-mca` estimates the Instructions; Per Cycle (IPC), as well as hardware resource pressure. The analysis and; reporting style were inspired by the IACA tool from Intel. For example, you can compile code with clang, output assembly, and pipe it; directly into :program:`llvm-mca` for analysis:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. Or for Intel syntax:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -masm=intel -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. (:program:`llvm-mca` detects Intel syntax by the presence of an `.intel_syntax`; directive at the beginning of the input. By default its output syntax matches; that of its input.). Scheduling models are not just used to compute instruction latencies and; throughput, but also to understand what processor resources are available; and how to simulate them. By design, the quality of the analysis conducted by :program:`llvm-mca` is; inevitably affected by the quality of the scheduling models in LLVM. If you see that the performance report is not accurate for a processor,; please `file a bug <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_; against the appropriate backend. OPTIONS; -------.

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.vector.extract.*``' intrinsics extract a vector from within another; vector starting from a given index. The return type must be explicitly; specified. Conceptually, this can be used to decompose a scalable vector into; non-scalable parts, however this intrinsic can also be used on purely fixed; types. Scalable vectors can only be extracted from other scalable vectors. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The ``vec`` is the vector from which we will extract a subvector. The ``idx`` specifies the starting element number within ``vec`` from which a; subvector is extracted. ``idx`` must be a constant multiple of the known-minimum; vector length of the result type. If the result type is a scalable vector,; ``idx`` is first scaled by the result type's runtime scaling factor. Elements; ``idx`` through (``idx`` + num_elements(result_type) - 1) must be valid vector; indices. If this condition cannot be determined statically but is false at; runtime, then the result vector is a :ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>`. The; ``idx`` parameter must be a vector index constant type (for most targets this; will be an integer pointer type).

Performance,"lly allocated when the hardware creates work-groups of wavefronts, and; freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires; hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

Performance,"lly dispatched call sent to this; receiver because the function definition is considered to be fully resolved. * ``DynamicDispatchModeConservative`` - Models the case where the dynamic type; information is assumed to be incorrect, for example, implies that the method; definition is overridden in a subclass. In such cases, ExprEngine does not; inline the methods sent to the receiver (MemoryRegion), even if a candidate; definition is available. This mode is conservative about simulating the; effects of a call. Going forward along the symbolic execution path, ExprEngine consults the mode; of the receiver's MemRegion to make decisions on whether the calls should be; inlined or not, which ensures that there is at most one split per region. At a high level, ""bifurcation mode"" allows for increased semantic coverage in; cases where the parent method contains code which is only executed when the; class is subclassed. The disadvantages of this mode are a (considerable?); performance hit and the possibility of false positives on the path where the; conservative mode is used. Objective-C Message Heuristics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ExprEngine relies on a set of heuristics to partition the set of Objective-C; method calls into those that require bifurcation and those that do not. Below; are the cases when the DynamicTypeInfo of the object is considered precise; (cannot be a subclass):. - If the object was created with +alloc or +new and initialized with an -init; method. - If the calls are property accesses using dot syntax. This is based on the; assumption that children rarely override properties, or do so in an; essentially compatible way. - If the class interface is declared inside the main source file. In this case; it is unlikely that it will be subclassed. - If the method is not declared outside of main source file, either by the; receiver's class or by any superclasses. C++ Caveats; ^^^^^^^^^^^.

Performance,"lly; very efficient and do not incur a large runtime overhead. The; sample data collected by the profiler can be used during compilation; to determine what the most executed areas of the code are. Using the data from a sample profiler requires some changes in the way; a program is built. Before the compiler can use profiling information,; the code needs to execute under the profiler. The following is the; usual build cycle when using sample profilers for optimization:. 1. Build the code with source line table information. You can use all the; usual build flags that you always build your application with. The only; requirement is that you add ``-gline-tables-only`` or ``-g`` to the; command line. This is important for the profiler to be able to map; instructions back to source line locations. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -gline-tables-only code.cc -o code. 2. Run the executable under a sampling profiler. The specific profiler; you use does not really matter, as long as its output can be converted; into the format that the LLVM optimizer understands. Currently, there; exists a conversion tool for the Linux Perf profiler; (https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/), so these examples assume that you; are using Linux Perf to profile your code. .. code-block:: console. $ perf record -b ./code. Note the use of the ``-b`` flag. This tells Perf to use the Last Branch; Record (LBR) to record call chains. While this is not strictly required,; it provides better call information, which improves the accuracy of; the profile data. 3. Convert the collected profile data to LLVM's sample profile format.; This is currently supported via the AutoFDO converter ``create_llvm_prof``.; It is available at https://github.com/google/autofdo. Once built and; installed, you can convert the ``perf.data`` file to LLVM using; the command:. .. code-block:: console. $ create_llvm_prof --binary=./code --out=code.prof.

Avoid loads and stores of large aggregate type; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM currently does not optimize well loads and stores of large :ref:`aggregate; types <t_aggregate>` (i.e. structs and arrays). As an alternative, consider; loading individual fields from memory. Aggregates that are smaller than the largest (performant) load or store; instruction supported by the targeted hardware are well supported. These can; be an effective way to represent collections of small packed fields. Prefer zext over sext when legal; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. On some architectures (X86_64 is one), sign extension can involve an extra; instruction whereas zero extension can be folded into a load. LLVM will try to; replace a sext with a zext when it can be proven safe, but if you have; information in your source language about the range of an integer value, it can; be profitable to use a zext rather than a sext. Alternatively, you can :ref:`specify the range of the value using metadata; <range-metadata>` and LLVM can do the sext to zext conversion for you. Zext GEP indices to machine register width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Internally, LLVM often promotes the width of GEP indices to machine register; width. When it does so, it will default to using sign extension (sext); operations for safety. If your source language provides information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction.

If any FP operation in a function is constrained then they all must be; constrained. This is required for correct LLVM IR. Optimizations that; move code around can create miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::.

AMDGPU supports programming languages that include online compilation where the; source text may be created at runtime. For example, the OpenCL and HIP language; runtimes support online compilation. To support is, a way to embed the source; text in the debug information is provided.

Performance,"lookup is no longer handled by layers. Instead, there is a; ``lookup`` method on JITDylib that takes a list of JITDylibs to scan. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; JITDylib &JD1 = ...;; JITDylib &JD2 = ...;. auto Sym = ES.lookup({&JD1, &JD2}, ES.intern(""_main""));. 6.

For code examples and suggestions of how to use the ORCv2 APIs, please see; the section `How-tos`_. How-tos; =======. How to manage symbol strings; ----------------------------. Symbol strings in ORC are uniqued to improve lookup performance, reduce memory; overhead, and allow symbol names to function as efficient keys. To get the; unique ``SymbolStringPtr`` for a string value, call the; ``ExecutionSession::intern`` method:. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; /// ...; auto MainSymbolName = ES.intern(""main"");. If you wish to perform lookup using the C/IR name of a symbol you will also; need to apply the platform linker-mangling before interning the string. On; Linux this mangling is a no-op, but on other platforms it usually involves; adding a prefix to the string (e.g. '_' on Darwin). The mangling scheme is; based on the DataLayout for the target. Given a DataLayout and an; ExecutionSession, you can create a MangleAndInterner function object that; will perform both jobs for you:. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; const DataLayout &DL = ...;; MangleAndInterner Mangle(ES, DL);. // ... // Portable IR-symbol-name lookup:; auto Sym = ES.lookup({&MainJD}, Mangle(""main""));. How to create JITDylibs and set up linkage relationships; --------------------------------------------------------. In ORC, all symbol definitions reside in JITDylibs. JITDylibs are created by; calling the ``ExecutionSession::createJITDylib`` method with a unique name:. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; auto &JD = ES.createJITDylib(""libFoo.dylib"");.

With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time.

At each callsite, a ""liveout"" register list is also recorded. These; are the registers that are live across the stackmap and therefore must; be saved by the runtime. This is an important optimization when the; patchpoint intrinsic is used with a calling convention that by default; preserves most registers as callee-save. Each entry in the liveout register list contains a DWARF register; number and size in bytes. The stackmap format deliberately omits; specific subregister information. Instead the runtime must interpret; this information conservatively. For example, if the stackmap reports; one byte at ``%rax``, then the value may be in either ``%al`` or; ``%ah``. It doesn't matter in practice, because the runtime will; simply save ``%rax``. However, if the stackmap reports 16 bytes at; ``%ymm0``, then the runtime can safely optimize by saving only; ``%xmm0``. The stack map format is a contract between an LLVM SVN revision and; the runtime. It is currently experimental and may change in the short; term, but minimizing the need to update the runtime is; important. Consequently, the stack map design is motivated by; simplicity and extensibility. Compactness of the representation is; secondary because the runtime is expected to parse the data; immediately after compiling a module and encode the information in its; own format. Since the runtime controls the allocation of sections, it; can reuse the same stack map space for multiple modules. Stackmap support is currently only implemented for 64-bit; platforms.

This requires two transformations: reassociation of; expressions (to make the add's lexically identical) and Common; Subexpression Elimination (CSE) to delete the redundant add instruction.; Fortunately, LLVM provides a broad range of optimizations that you can; use, in the form of ""passes"". LLVM Optimization Passes; ========================. LLVM provides many optimization passes, which do many different sorts of; things and have different tradeoffs. Unlike other systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in.

Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary. In order to build your fuzzer binary, use the `-fsanitize=fuzzer` flag during the; compilation and linking. In most cases you may want to combine libFuzzer with; AddressSanitizer_ (ASAN), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer_ (UBSAN), or both. You can; also build with MemorySanitizer_ (MSAN), but support is experimental::. clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target w/o sanitizers; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with ASAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,signed-integer-overflow mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with a part of UBSAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,memory mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with MSAN. This will perform the necessary instrumentation, as well as linking with the libFuzzer library.; Note that ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` links in the libFuzzer's ``main()`` symbol. If modifying ``CFLAGS`` of a large project, which also compiles executables; requiring their own ``main`` symbol, it may be desirable to request just the; instrumentation without linking::. clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c. Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in; ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` during the linking stage. .. _libfuzzer-corpus:. Corpus; ------. Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files.

To determine whether a statement reads or writes a field we can implement; symbolic evaluation of `DeclRefExpr`s, `LValueToRValue` casts, pointer; dereference operator and `MemberExpr`s. ### Using data flow results to identify output parameters. Let's take a look at how we use data flow analysis to identify an output; parameter. The refactoring can be safely done when the data flow algorithm; computes a normal state with all of the fields proven to be overwritten in the; exit basic block of the function. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; };. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; } else {; c->name = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {c->account_id, c->name}; }; ```. When the data flow algorithm computes a normal state, but not all fields are; proven to be overwritten we can't perform the refactoring. ```c++; void target(bool b, Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; if (b) {; c->account_id = 42; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; } else {; c->name = ""Konrad""; // Overwritten: {c->name}; }; // Overwritten: {}; }; ```. Similarly, when the data flow algorithm computes a failure state, we also can't; perform the refactoring. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer* c) {; // Overwritten: {}; c->account_id = ...; // Overwritten: {c->account_id}; if (...) {; print(c->name); // Unsafe read; } else {; kGlobalCustomer = c; // Pointer escape; }; // Unsafe read, Pointer escape; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead stores. Let's say we want to find redundant stores, because they indicate potential; bugs. ```c++; x = GetX();; x = GetY();; ```. The first store to `x` is never read, probably there is a bug.

The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3. Space is allocated for the kernel arguments using the HSA compatible runtime; allocator for a memory region with the kernarg property for the kernel agent; that will execute the kernel. It must be at least 16-byte aligned.; 4. Kernel argument values are assigned to the kernel argument memory; allocation. The layout is defined in the *HSA Programmer's Language; Reference* [HSA]_. For AMDGPU the kernel execution directly accesses the; kernel argument memory in the same way constant memory is accessed. (Note; that the HSA specification allows an implementation to copy the kernel; argument contents to another location that is accessed by the kernel.); 5.

Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If you; have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic up on; the llvm-dev list.

Performance,"machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid; needing to invalidate the L2 cache.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed; by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to; invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches.

Here precision represents the desired maximum accepted overlap value in; centimeters (default value is 0.1). This tool checks all possible; significant pairs of candidates inside a given volume (not declared as; overlapping or division volumes).

For a 100% reliability, one can perform the; check at the level of a single volume by using `option`=""`d`"" or; `option`=""`d<number>`"" to perform overlap checking by sampling the; volume with \<`number`\> random points (default 1 million).

Because the bit-representation of a non-integral pointer may; not be stable, two identical casts of the same operand may or may not; return the same value. Said differently, the conversion to or from the; non-integral type depends on environmental state in an implementation; defined manner. If the frontend wishes to observe a *particular* value following a cast, the; generated IR must fence with the underlying environment in an implementation; defined manner. (In practice, this tends to require ``noinline`` routines for; such operations.). From the perspective of the optimizer, ``inttoptr`` and ``ptrtoint`` for; non-integral types are analogous to ones on integral types with one; key exception: the optimizer may not, in general, insert new dynamic; occurrences of such casts. If a new cast is inserted, the optimizer would; need to either ensure that a) all possible values are valid, or b); appropriate fencing is inserted. Since the appropriate fencing is; implementation defined, the optimizer can't do the latter. The former is; challenging as many commonly expected properties, such as; ``ptrtoint(v)-ptrtoint(v) == 0``, don't hold for non-integral types.; Similar restrictions apply to intrinsics that might examine the pointer bits,; such as :ref:`llvm.ptrmask<int_ptrmask>`. . The alignment information provided by the frontend for a non-integral pointer; (typically using attributes or metadata) must be valid for every possible ; representation of the pointer. .. _globalvars:.

Performance,"mand in the canvas File menu pops-up a print dialog where; the user can specify a preferred print command and the printer name. ![](pictures/0300002D.png). Both print parameters can be set via the new Print.Command and; Print.Printer rootrc resources as follows:. ```; # Printer settings.; WinNT.*.Print.Command: AcroRd32.exe; Unix.*.Print.Command: xprint -P%p %f; Print.Printer: 32-rb205-hp; Print.Directory: .; ```. If the `%p` and `%f` are specified as a part of the print command,; they will be replaced by the specified printer name and the file name.; All other parameters will be kept as they are written. A print button; is available in the canvas toolbar (activated via View menu/Toolbar). ## The ROOT Command Line. We have briefly touched on how to use the command line. There are; different types of commands. 1. Cling commands start with ""`.`"". ``` {.cpp}; root[] .? //this command will list all the Cling commands; root[] .L <filename> //load [filename]; root[] .x <filename> //load and execute [filename]; ```. 2. SHELL commands start with ""`.!`"" for example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .! ls; ```. 3. C++ commands follow C++ syntax (almost). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser(); ```. ### Multi-line Commands. You can use the command line to execute multi-line commands. To begin; a multi-line command you must type a single left curly bracket `{`,; and to end it you must type a single right curly bracket `}`.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] {; end with '}'> Int_t j = 0;; end with '}'> for (Int_t i = 0; i < 3; i++); end with '}'> {; end with '}'> j= j + i;; end with '}'> cout << ""i = "" << i << "", j = "" << j << endl;; end with '}'> }; end with '}'> }; i = 0, j = 0; i = 1, j = 1; i = 2, j = 3; ```. It is more convenient to edit a script than the command line, and if; your multi line commands are getting unmanageable, you may want to; start with a script instead. ### Cling Extensions.

This can, for example, be emitted by the loop vectorizer in which case; ``%base`` is the first element of the vector induction variable (VIV) and; ``%n`` is the loop tripcount. Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow.

Force floating-point operations to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode by default. The result of a floating-point operation often cannot be exactly represented in the result type and therefore must be rounded. IEEE 754 describes different rounding modes that control how to perform this rounding, not all of which are supported by all implementations. C provides interfaces (``fesetround`` and ``fesetenv``) for dynamically controlling the rounding mode, and while it also recommends certain conventions for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables. Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode. This prevents optimizations which might affect results if the rounding mode changes or is different from the default; for example, it prevents floating-point operations from being reordered across most calls and prevents constant-folding when the result is not exactly representable. .. option:: -ffp-model=<value>.

Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very; practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible; overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating; honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using; assemblies can be found at:; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/assembly.C.html>`.`.

Note that components cannot be declared as ""overlapping"" and that a; component can be an assembly volume. For existing flat volume; structures, one can define assemblies to force a hierarchical structure; therefore optimizing the performance. Usage of assemblies does NOT imply; penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape.

Performance,"mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap.

The API to; use is ``Instruction::applyMergedLocation``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that a) the single merged instruction; has a location with an accurate scope attached, and b) to prevent misleading; single-stepping (or breakpoint) behavior. Often, merged instructions are memory; accesses which can trap: having an accurate scope attached greatly assists in; crash triage by identifying the (possibly inlined) function where the bad; memory access occurred. This rule is also meant to assist SamplePGO by banning; scenarios in which a sample of a block containing a merged instruction is; misattributed to a block containing one of the instructions-to-be-merged. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Merging identical loads/stores which occur on both sides of a CFG diamond; (see the ``MergedLoadStoreMotion`` pass). * Merging identical loop-invariant stores (see the LICM utility; ``llvm::promoteLoopAccessesToScalars``). * Peephole optimizations which combine multiple instructions together, like; ``(add (mul A B) C) => llvm.fma.f32(A, B, C)``.

HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic).

Performance,"mine the location of values at a specific position in; the code. LLVM does not maintain any mapping between those values and; any higher-level entity. The runtime must be able to interpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire.

Performance,"mm4. According to this report, the dot-product kernel has been executed 300 times,; for a total of 900 simulated instructions. The total number of simulated micro; opcodes (uOps) is also 900. The report is structured in three main sections. The first section collects a; few performance numbers; the goal of this section is to give a very quick; overview of the performance throughput. Important performance indicators are; **IPC**, **uOps Per Cycle**, and **Block RThroughput** (Block Reciprocal; Throughput). Field *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes that are dispatched; to the out-of-order backend every simulated cycle. For processors with an; in-order backend, *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes issued; to the backend every simulated cycle. IPC is computed dividing the total number of simulated instructions by the total; number of cycles. Field *Block RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the block throughput. Block; throughput is a theoretical quantity computed as the maximum number of blocks; (i.e. iterations) that can be executed per simulated clock cycle in the absence; of loop carried dependencies. Block throughput is superiorly limited by the; dispatch rate, and the availability of hardware resources. In the absence of loop-carried data dependencies, the observed IPC tends to a; theoretical maximum which can be computed by dividing the number of instructions; of a single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field 'uOps Per Cycle' is computed dividing the total number of simulated micro; opcodes by the total number of cycles. A delta between Dispatch Width and this; field is an indicator of a performance issue.

This is safe because all of the output bits are affected by the undef; bits.

These logical operations have bits that are not always affected by the; input. For example, if ``%X`` has a zero bit, then the output of the; '``and``' operation will always be a zero for that bit, no matter what; the corresponding bit from the '``undef``' is. As such, it is unsafe to; optimize or assume that the result of the '``and``' is '``undef``'.; However, it is safe to assume that all bits of the '``undef``' could be; 0, and optimize the '``and``' to 0. Likewise, it is safe to assume that; all the bits of the '``undef``' operand to the '``or``' could be set,; allowing the '``or``' to be folded to -1. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = select undef, %X, %Y; %B = select undef, 42, %Y; %C = select %X, %Y, undef; Safe:; %A = %X (or %Y); %B = 42 (or %Y); %C = %Y (if %Y is provably not poison; unsafe otherwise); Unsafe:; %A = undef; %B = undef; %C = undef. This set of examples shows that undefined '``select``' (and conditional; branch) conditions can go *either way*, but they have to come from one; of the two operands. In the ``%A`` example, if ``%X`` and ``%Y`` were; both known to have a clear low bit, then ``%A`` would have to have a; cleared low bit.

This allows LLVM to provide a; powerful intermediate representation for efficient compiler; transformations and analysis, while providing a natural means to debug; and visualize the transformations. The three different forms of LLVM are; all equivalent. This document describes the human readable; representation and notation. The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while; being expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be; a ""universal IR"" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that; high-level ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how; microprocessors are ""universal IR's"", allowing many source languages to; be mapped to them). By providing type information, LLVM can be used as; the target of optimizations: for example, through pointer analysis, it; can be proven that a C automatic variable is never accessed outside of; the current function, allowing it to be promoted to a simple SSA value; instead of a memory location. .. _wellformed:. Well-Formedness; ---------------. It is important to note that this document describes 'well formed' LLVM; assembly language. There is a difference between what the parser accepts; and what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following; instruction is syntactically okay, but not well formed:. .. code-block:: llvm. %x = add i32 1, %x. because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The; LLVM infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to; verify that an LLVM module is well formed. This pass is automatically; run by the parser after parsing input assembly and by the optimizer; before it outputs bitcode. The violations pointed out by the verifier; pass indicate bugs in transformation passes or input to the parser. .. _identifiers:. Identifiers; ===========.

This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm.

Performance,"mpiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*.

The implementation avoids recursive actions and relies on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI.

For example, consider the following code:. inline int add(int i, int j) { return i + j; }. int main() {; int i = add(4, 5);; return i;; }. In C99, inline means that a function's definition is; provided only for inlining, and that there is another definition; (without inline) somewhere else in the program.

By contrast, GNU C89 mode (used by default in older versions of GCC) is the; C89 standard plus a lot of extensions.

This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger.

Performance,"much faster than the usual; shape-to-shape comparison. For a 100% reliability, one can perform the; check at the level of a single volume by using `option`=""`d`"" or; `option`=""`d<number>`"" to perform overlap checking by sampling the; volume with \<`number`\> random points (default 1 million). This; produces also a picture showing in red the overlapping region and; estimates the volume of the overlaps. An extrusion A) is declared in any of the following cases:. - At least one of the vertices of the daughter mesh representation is; outside the mother volume (in fact its shape) and having a safety; distance to the mother greater than the desired value;; - At least one of the mother vertices is contained also by one of its; daughters, in the same conditions. An overlap B) is declared if:. - At least one vertex of a positioned volume mesh is contained (having; a safety bigger than the accepted maximum value) by other positioned; volume inside the same container. The check is performed also by; inverting the candidates. The code is highly optimized to avoid checking candidates that are far; away in space by performing a fast check on their bounding boxes. Once; the checking tool is fired-up inside a volume or at top level, the list; of overlaps (visible as Illegal overlaps inside a **`TBrowser`**) held; by the manager class will be filled with **`TGeoOverlap`** objects; containing a full description of the detected overlaps. The list is; sorted in the decreasing order of the overlapping distance, extrusions; coming first. An overlap object name represents the full description of; the overlap, containing both candidate node names and a letter; (x-extrusion, o-overlap) representing the type.

I am still intrigued,; however, by the prospect of a minimally allocated VM representation... I; think that it could have definite advantages for certain applications; (think very small machines, like PDAs). I don't, however, think that our; initial implementations should focus on this. :). Here are some other auxiliary goals that I think we should consider:. 1. Primary goal: Support a high performance dynamic compilation; system. This means that we have an ""ideal"" division of labor between; the runtime and static compilers. Of course, the other goals of the; system somewhat reduce the importance of this point (f.e. portability; reduces performance, but hopefully not much); 2. Portability to different processors. Since we are most familiar with; x86 and solaris, I think that these two are excellent candidates when; we get that far...; 3. Support for all languages & styles of programming (general purpose; VM). This is the point that disallows java style bytecodes, where all; array refs are checked for bounds, etc...; 4. Support linking between different language families.

Performance,"mum set by; ``setMaxAtomicSizeInBitsSupported`` (which defaults to 0). On x86, all atomic loads generate a ``MOV``. SequentiallyConsistent stores; generate an ``XCHG``, other stores generate a ``MOV``. SequentiallyConsistent; fences generate an ``MFENCE``, other fences do not cause any code to be; generated. ``cmpxchg`` uses the ``LOCK CMPXCHG`` instruction. ``atomicrmw xchg``; uses ``XCHG``, ``atomicrmw add`` and ``atomicrmw sub`` use ``XADD``, and all; other ``atomicrmw`` operations generate a loop with ``LOCK CMPXCHG``. Depending; on the users of the result, some ``atomicrmw`` operations can be translated into; operations like ``LOCK AND``, but that does not work in general. On ARM (before v8), MIPS, and many other RISC architectures, Acquire, Release,; and SequentiallyConsistent semantics require barrier instructions for every such; operation. Loads and stores generate normal instructions. ``cmpxchg`` and; ``atomicrmw`` can be represented using a loop with LL/SC-style instructions; which take some sort of exclusive lock on a cache line (``LDREX`` and ``STREX``; on ARM, etc.). It is often easiest for backends to use AtomicExpandPass to lower some of the; atomic constructs.

Performance,"must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```.

This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unrea",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:29233,load,loads,29233,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']
