Safety,"> In practice, changing the test as this PR does introduces a ODR (one definition rule) violation: i.e. some of the code use one version of `std::span` and some of the code use a different version of `std::span`. Exactly, that's the tricky part of this issue. If no other means are used to avoid problems, and the compilation is successful, directly adding the same name to the std will potentially lead to many surprises. . If I understand correctly, the same is true for `std::string_view`. See `RStringView.hxx`:. ```C++; #if defined(R__HAS_STD_STRING_VIEW) || R__MSVC_LANG >= 201703L || __cplusplus >= 201703L. #include <string_view>. #else. # if defined(R__HAS_STD_EXPERIMENTAL_STRING_VIEW); # include <experimental/string_view>; # else; # include ""RWrap_libcpp_string_view.h""; # endif; ```. There is also a feature test macro. If someone uses C++17 and links to the ROOT compiled by C++14, they might encounter the same issue. I think it is a better practice to change a namespace (such as `cxx20::span`, `cxx17::string_view`, etc.) and provide the corresponding implicit conversion when the standard matches. In this way, users will not be disturbed to use normally, and these features are also available inside ROOT. The only symmetry break is in the API. Because the features exposed are not those of the standard library, users may need to manually convert them in some cases, so implicit conversion should be provided. . For example:. ```C++; #if __cplusplus >= 202002L; # include <span>; #endif. namespace cxx20 {. constexpr std::size_t dynamic_extent =; #if __cplusplus >= 202002L; std::dynamic_extent;; #else; /* something */;; #endif. template<class T, std::size_t Extent = dynamic_extent>; class span {. // ... here is the normal implementation. #if __cplusplus >= 202002L; public:; constexpr operator std::span<T, Extent>() noexcept;; constexpr span(const std::span<T, Extent>& other) noexcept;; constexpr span& operator=(const std::span<T, Extent>& other) noexcept;; #endif. // ... h",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1253349273:290,avoid,avoid,290,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1253349273,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Furthermore the compiler is also allowed to re-order code in 'surprising ways' that would thwart/foil the assumption on the happenstance you describe.

Safety,"> The intent is the opposite. The RDirectory's internal representation and what it returns is a kind of shared_ptr. The user register the same name twice then if they hold a 'reference' to it, they keep and if they don't it is deleted. I do appreciate that as written it works and prevents a leak. New and delete have also worked for 20 years of root, and when written correctly do prevent leaks and get the job done, so there's no crisis of course. This offers a little more protection in some usages, but maybe new things to understand in others. I think stack-based lifetime management is simple, intuitive, encourages top-down code design and configuration, and avoids side effects. The smart pointer is interesting. It wasn't obvious to me that create would behave like shared_ptr::reset(), in the sense of allowing copies to persist (rather than redirecting some pointers they contain to the the new thing). . I kind of see a way now that it's possible to get the scalability (produce variable N plots at a time) without editing the PR routine. From my caller I'd need to call the subroutine, then do an RDirectory::Find() to get a shared pointer which will preserve the created thing, then call the routine again to get a new one. And if I still want to keep the first one for the interactive prompt, I have to make it global again with a new RDirectory::Add() of the contained thing, with a new name.

Safety,"@amadio thanks for the comments. How this solves the CMS problem is illustrated by the example callback I included. That wraps the merge operation with an `std::promise()`, does a `task_arena::enqueue()` with that functor to the existing CMS framework TBB task arena, and then waits for the promise to complete. `task_arena::enqueue()` guarantees that the functor is executed by an existing member of the arena's thread pool. If the calling thread is not part of the arena, it cannot join it, so it cannot execute the functor itself. AFAICT, `task_arena::enqueue()` is the only interface that guarantees this; with other interfaces like `task_arena::execute()` or `task_group::run()`, the calling thread can temporarily join the arena, which would violate our framework's scheduling assumptions. wrt the interface change, my previous version added a second callback instead of modifying the existing one. From a functionality standpoint, the wrapper callback is a superset of the completion callback, but I do see the virtue of keeping the completion callback safe and having a separate callback for the riskier operation of wrapping the merge. I can certainly make that change if that would be more acceptable. I initially tried to do this with the `TTaskGroup`; unfortunately, with a `TTaskGroup` the calling thread can end up temporarily joining the task arena, which wasn't acceptable to us. It seems we have to use `task_arena::execute()`, which requires access to the framework task arena, which is how I ended using a callback for this.

Safety,"@sawenzel I get your point about thread safety, and agree that even the previous version was thread-unsafe, so I will deal with this later. The current version introduces a rather large critical section in `TGeoParallelWorld::InitSafetyVoxel` that blocks all concurrent threads even if they want to update the cache of different voxels, I would have pushed that lock a bit below where the update of the cache actually happens. But since this does not run in MT mode this is not critical now. Could you also do clang-formatting using ROOT style for the `bvh` part only (The entirety of TGeo is not yet formatted, but we will do it at some point), however the new files should be formatted. I looked and the internal thread pool is actually used for building the BVH in parallel, which is cool, but there may still be some unused headers, such as `sphere.h` - could you cross-check that and remove whatever is not needed?. The compilation errors on Mac are unrelated to your PR. Still, the compilation on alma8 with gcc8.5 fails, although it should not because the standard is set correctly to C++17 and the header <numeric> is included. ; ```; Error: /github/home/ROOT-CI/src/geom/geom/inc/bvh/v2/vec.h:99:17: error: ‘transform_reduce’ is not a member of ‘std’; ```; So @dpiparo what do we do about this since the `gcc` compliance with C++17 is known to be stable only starting with the gcc9 series?

As you see in the change diff, there are lots of changes that are not meant to be there (that you should also have seen before creating the pull request, in the ""Review changes"" section). Also there are a number of merge conflicts. You must solve this locally before creating the PR. You must rebase your commits on top of `master`, otherwise this is not going to work. Here's what I would recommend, provided that your actual commits are on a local branch called `latest-stable`:; ```bash; $ git branch -m latest-stable tmva-variable-plotter # Renames your local branch; $ git fetch origin master:master; $ git checkout tmva-variable-plotter. # Rebase your 'tmva-variable-plotter' branch onto 'master', provided that the fork point of your branch was 'origin/latest-stable'.; # The default editor will open showing a number of 'pick' lines; just verify that those commits are part of your work. You may; # need to fix any merge conflict that might happen here.; $ git rebase --interactive --onto master origin/latest-stable. # If you mess up at some point while rebasing, you can revert to the previous state issueing `$ git rebase --abort`. # Then push your changes to GitHub and open a new pull-request; $ git push ...; ```. Afterward, you can open a new pull request with origin on `sazio:tmva-variable-plotter` targetting `root-project:master`.

The code says:; ```; module ""experimental/string_view"" {; export *; header ""experimental/algorithm""; }; ```; ; The commit content as-is seems completely unrelated to the commit log as far as I could tell (without doing research on the relationship between `range_base`, `string_view` and `algorithm`.; ; So I pondered whether the fix was the right fix for a problem I did not know anything about ... ; ; The right thing to do would have probably be have been to request a complete explanation of what the original problem was, what was the mechanism leading to the error and why this solution was the best solution.

Safety,"@vgvassilev if ""not exception safe"" here means w.r.t. `bad_allocs`, ROOT in general does not care (nothing works in that case anyway). If ""not exception safe"" means ""might leak if constructors of elements throw"", I don't think we care too much:. - RVec is mostly used with fundamental types ; - anyway that's not a situation in which analyses can/want to keep running, typically. Regarding your alternative proposals: we can't use a vanilla `std::vector` as a workhorse because we want to be able to adopt existing memory buffers. That would require std::vector + a custom allocator (like in the current implementation of RVec) which is fairly tricky to implement correctly (in fact, the current implementation has [broken usecases](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6796)), and the more complex class layout makes it harder for RNTuple to perform I/O. `std::vector<bool>` weirdness complicates matters (and I/O) further. So the alternative is basically re-implementing vector-with-adoption-and-sbo ourselves. All considered I think we could be ok with leaving the object in a ""bad"" state in case the construction of vector elements throws (which I think is what ""not exception safe"" means in this context), for the two reasons mentioned above -- but I'd like @Axel-Naumann to make the call.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7502#issuecomment-818905333:30,safe,safe,30,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7502#issuecomment-818905333,3,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"A follow-up from the [discussion on #12664](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12664#discussion_r1175726403). The main questions are:. 1. Is a ""dense representation"" (bit vector + default constructed elements for non-available items) really needed; 2. Where is the break-even for the dense representation vs. the sparse representation; 3. Does a ""modified dense"" representation make sense? The modified dense representation would skip creating unavailable items. In order to avoid counting all the 1-bits from the start of the cluster, this representation would need to additionally store the cumulative number of 1 bits per page, e.g. in the page meta-data or in a separate column. To help answer the question, we should fill a table with size figures for the following tests with a few MB of data:. - Nullable field of `bool`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `struct` of a few tens of bytes; - Fill levels 0%, 10%, 50%, 90%, 100%; - Using sparse, dense, modified dense representation; - zstd compressed and uncompressed.

Safety,"After reviewing the implementation of `RPageSinkBuf` and starting to prototype parallel RNTuple writing, I would like to propose moving the code related to descriptor building and serialization into a new class. The main observation here is that ""wrapping"" `RPageSink`s do not need that functionality, only the ""final"" sink that actually writes to files or DAOS. For now, I named the class `RPagePersistentSink`, but that's of course up for debate. Other options include ""final"" (even though that is ambiguous in the context of a class hierarchy) and ""serializing"". The first two commits may be useful independent of the rest of the series; the one to ""Avoid calling `PageSink::UpdateSchema` from `RPageSinkBuf`"" depends on moving the `Commit` implementations first (which access `fOpenColumnRanges` and `fOpenPageRanges`. *If* we decide that we want to introduce an intermediate class, we need to carefully benchmark with buffered writes disabled (ie without `RPageSinkBuf`) because there will now be two `virtual` function calls for every `Commit`; with `RPageSinkBuf` we avoid the duplicate serialization.

Safety,"After updating to `clang-14.0.6-1.module_el8.7.0+1198+0c3eb6e2.x86_64`, many tests started failing when compiling ROOT with Clang (134 tests in my configuration). The reason seems to be that Clang is now built with [`GCC_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rh/gcc-toolset-12/root/usr`](https://git.centos.org/rpms/clang/c/4e0495208f843a286dc0d06d9abdc3433a66983a) to detect and use `libstdc++` from GCC 12. Even if that was not the case, https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/35aaf548237a4f213ba9d95de53b33c5ce1eadce in Clang 15 will have a similar effect for people building the compiler from source. According to our own documentation, ROOT does not guarantee [""compatibility with compilers shipped with `devtoolsets` on CentOS or Red Hat""](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/#caveats) which right now only leaves building with the system-default GCC 8.5 to get a fully working installation of ROOT.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11601:351,detect,detect,351,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11601,1,['detect'],['detect']
Safety,"After upgrading ROOT to 6.30, one of our applications also started giving us the error mentioned in this thread; ```; Fatal in <operator new>: with std::align_val_t is not implemented yet; ```; A little research led me to this: https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/aborting-with-std-align-val-t-is-not-implemented-yet-rhel-9-2/55989. If I understand correctly, this is the situation:. - `TMapFile` requires linking with libNew; - libNew is broken with -std=c++17 or higher (missing `operator new` overload); - ROOT 6.30 requires C++17; - Hence `TMapFile` (and actually all of `libNew`) is currently unusable in ROOT 6.30. There are no workarounds. Please elaborate if I am missing something. This is a bit of an issue. You do realize that EPEL 9 provides just such a broken version (ROOT 6.30.02 with -std=c++17). Hence, on RHEL 9/Alma 9 etc. (i.e. the current go-to version of Linux at many labs), anyone who needs to use `TMapFile` (or `libNew`) must downgrade to ROOT 6.28 and, possibly, compile by hand with -std=c++14. Additionally, on the latest version of macOS, Sonoma, only ROOT 6.30+ is supported. Hence, any code that uses `TMapFile` is inevitably broken at this time on the current version of macOS. The only ""workaround"" would be to downgrade (i.e. reinstall) the OS.; ; If I might make a suggestion: I would mention, or better: highlight, such regressions in the [release notes](https://root.cern/doc/v630/release-notes.html#release-6.3004) of a new version.

I also have an implementation working now based on ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific``` (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-reference/thread-local-storage/enumerablethreadspecific-template-class.html) . Now in principle what tbb is doing underneath should not so different from ``` TTHREAD_TLS_DECL```, at least for the explicit pthread-based version, so we can think about whether this is really safe from deadlocks, but the numbers looks pretty good. In the test output below ""TBB"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts>``` and ""TBBUnique"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts, tbb::cache_aligned_allocator<LocalCounts>, tbb::ets_key_per_instance>``` which is limited to a small number of instances per process (but not strictly to 1). If you would be willing to have tbb as a dependency for core/thread then I can add this (and maybe even remove the shared_mutex versions). ```; 76: Test command: /usr/bin/cmake ""-DCMD=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/core/thread/test/corethreadtestUnit"" ""-DCWD=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/core/thread/test"" ""-DSYS=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build"" ""-P"" ""/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/root/cmake/modules/RootTestDriver.cmake""; 76: Environment variables: ; 76: ROOT_HIST=0; 76: Test timeout computed to be: 1500; 76: Running main() from /scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/googletest-prefix/src/googletest/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc; 76: [==========] Running 126 tests from 3 test suites.; 76: [----------] Global test environment set-up.; 76: [----------] 6 tests from InterpreterLock; 76: [ RUN ] InterpreterLock.ConcurrentCalc; 76: [ OK ] InterpreterLock.ConcurrentCalc (87 ms); 76: [ RUN ] InterpreterLock.ReadLocks; 76: [ OK ] InterpreterLock.ReadLocks (78 ms); 76: [ RUN ] ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6919#issuecomment-742071485:625,safe,safe,625,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6919#issuecomment-742071485,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"As reported in issue https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11421, the fact that in the RooFit command; arguments, the `RooArgSet`s are often stored by pointer is still a; problem. I attempted before to circumvent the problem by detecting; potential lifetime issues by having a dedicated `RooArgSet&&` overloads; that resulted in RooCmdArgs that owned copied of the RooArgSets. However, this still didn't work for the case where the Python collection; pythonizations are used in PyROOT, because there the `RooArgSet &&`; overloads are not hit. I realized now that the `RooCmdArg` class already has the slots to store; RooArgSets by value, which was alredy used by a few RooFit command; arguments. When these `set` slots are used, there are no ownership; issues. This commit suggests to always use these `set` slots for RooArgSets.; This entailed changing the functions that make use of the command; arguments, migrating from `defineObject` to `defineSet`. All the hacks to get owned copies of the RooArgSets and `RooArgSet&&`; overloads can now be removed. Now that the slot indices for the sets was changed in many RooFit; command arguments, there is only the caveat that command arguments are; not backwards compatible anymore. However, this should not be any; problem because `RooCmdArgs` are not supposed to be written to files; anyway. To explicitely disallow this and prevent any silet backwards; compatibility issue, the class version of the RooCmdArg was set to zero; to disable IO. A first commit in this PR fixes also an other issue where the wrong command argument name was used in the RooMCStudy.

In principle, the other possible values for errno won't happen, but if they do, that should be considered an error, hence the assert condition needed an update. `EBUSY` shouldn't happen since we do not add `MS_INVALIDATE` to flags, and `EINVAL` shouldn't happen because we always pass a multiple of the page size to msync(). `EFAULT` is only used in Linux 2.4.18 and earlier instead of `ENOMEM`.

Safety,"Boundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal implementation. This causes an extra lookup/jump, which can be removed once BVH is fully validated. * For the BVH, a well known open source implementation is included in header-only form. The headers are copied from https://github.com/madmann91/bvh commit 66e445b92f68801a6dd8ef943fe3038976ecb4ff. * A new class, TGeoVoxelGrid is provided for the cartesian VoxelGrid container. ----. Performance examples:. In a test with the ALICE simulation framework including the ITS + TPC detectors with 48240 volumes on the parallel world, we see. * initialization time goes from TGeoVoxelFinder: 10s ---> BVH: 40ms; * Geant simulation time: 10s --> 2s; * memory usage: 3GB --> 1GB. Hence, this PR will make a big difference for the ALICE simulation program. It was verified, that identical results (number of hits, steps, etc) are obtained when going from TGeoVoxelFinder --> BVH+GRID. ----. Outlook:. Similar techniques could be applied to ordinary TGeoNavigator routines.

Safety,"Call typed overload of `SetBranchAddress` for array types like `np.ndarray` or `array.array`. The correct C++ template parameter is inferred from the array interface type information. This is an improvement for two reasons:. 1. We don't need to cast the arrays to a `void *` to avoid template resolution problems anymore. 2. More importantly: ROOT will do a runtime check for type compatibility, which was requested in the JIRA ticked linked below. To see the benefit of the added type check, take for example this code, where the branch address is set to an array address with a mismatched type:. ```python; import array; import ROOT. def create():; f = ROOT.TFile(""dummy.root"", 'RECREATE'); t = ROOT.TTree(""tree"", 'A tree'); a = array.array('f', [42]); br = t.Branch('a', a, 'a/F'). for x in (21, 42, 1337):; a[0] = x; t.Fill(). t.Write(); f.Close(). def test(typecode='f'):; f = ROOT.TFile(""dummy.root"", 'READ'); t = f.Get('tree'); a = array.array(typecode, [0]); status = t.SetBranchAddress('a', a); print(""Status = %s"" % (status, )). for i in range(t.GetEntries()):; t.GetEntry(i); print(""a = %s"" % (a[0], )). create(); test(""f""); test(""d""); ```. Before this commit, the output would be like this:; ```txt; Status = 4; a = 21.0; a = 42.0; a = 1337.0; Status = 4; a = 5.442276803e-315; a = 5.483722033e-315; a = 5.690664868e-315; ```.

Safety,"Clang 18 changed the name mangling of function templates, see https://releases.llvm.org/18.1.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#c-specific-potentially-breaking-changes. The first mentioned case is ""When a template parameter in a function template depends on a previous template parameter"", for example:; ```; struct A {; template <typename T, std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral_v<T>, int> = 0>; void Member(T p) {}; };. template void A::Member(int);; ```. With Clang < 18 and current versions of GCC, this will mangle to `_ZN1A6MemberIiLi0EEEvT_`, but Clang 18 and later will mangle it to `_ZN1A6MemberIiTnNSt9enable_ifIXsr3stdE13is_integral_vIT_EEiE4typeELi0EEEvS2_` (unless reverted for compatibility with `-fclang-abi-compat=17`). For ROOT's use of Cling, this poses a bidirectional problem:; * If building current master with Clang 18, the compiler will, by default, mangle according to the new rules. At runtime, Cling based on LLVM/Clang 16 will generate the old name, but that symbol cannot be found in the shared library.; * Conversely, in the current attempt to upgrade to LLVM/Clang 18, the opposite situation will happen when building with an ""older"" compiler so the shared library has the old name. In both cases, a failure of `tutorial-tmva-tmva103_Application` can be observed, when Cling cannot find the symbol. Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to detect which symbol names are in the shared library because it depends on the host compiler and configuration. Furthermore, with the current LLVM/Clang 16, we do not have access to the new mangling. Finally, it is unclear if generating the template instantiations in question actually takes up significant time during compilation. As such, the best approach in the current situation is to remove the `extern template` declarations and let the compiler / Cling re-generate them as needed. FYI @devajithvs",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16176:1372,detect,detect,1372,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16176,1,['detect'],['detect']
Safety,"Clang allows third party shared libraries to provide user-defined; extensions. For example, a custom libTemplateInstantiation.so can; visualize all template instantiation chains in clang. To enable it; one needs to pass a set of options such as -fplugin. Cling should be able to inherently work with clang plugins. However,; cling still does not make full use of the clang driver where the plugin; setup is handled. This patch enables plugins in cling and extends them in some aspects.; In particular, cling allows loading of plugins from shared libraries; but also if they are linked to the same library where cling is. This is; very useful in cases where cling runs itself in a shared library (eg; libCling). Users of libCling (such as ROOT) prefer to keep all llvm and; clang related symbols local to avoid symbol clashes if there is another; version of clang and llvm linked against a package. This can be done by; dlopen-ing libCling with RTLD_LOCAL visibility mode. Then the only way; for clang plugins to work in this scenario is to be linked to libCling.

Safety,"Dear ROOT experts,. When using [DD4hep](https://dd4hep.web.cern.ch/dd4hep/) to try and describe the geometry of the upgraded LHCb detector geometry, we've noticed overlapping geometry that's not picked up by running `gGeoManager::CheckOverlaps`. The geometry is attached as ROOT files (Geometry.root and Geometry_ClampInModule.root). To view the geometry we run in a ROOT session (or as a macro); ```c++; TGeoManager::Import(""Geometry.root""); gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw(""ogl""); ```; and then running `gGeoManager->CheckOverlaps(0.00001)` Does not find the overlap between the shapes `pvCoolingClamp` and `pvPipeBottom` (The list of shapes can be found by opening a `TBrowser` after importing the geometry and navigating the 'default' folder). The expected behavior here is that overlaps would be found between these shapes as one passes straight through the other. I have also tried moving the Cooling Clamp to the top of the shape and trying again there (see Geometry_ClampInModule.root) and here overlaps are only identified between the Cooling Clamp and simple shapes (e.g. Chips, glue) but not `lvDet` or `lvModule` itself. These 'simple shapes' refer to just cuboids/cylinders/etc rather than subtractions of shapes which is how the others are produced. The expected behavior here is that overlaps would be found between each of these visibly overlapping shapes. Do you know what may be causing this or how it could be fixed?. My setup typically is done by running dd4hep `geoDisplay` however with the attached root files it can be reproduced using any recent LCG view (I used 96b).

Since we have externally installed llvm, we configure and build clang as a standalone project.

Clang provides dependencies such as FileCheck and not which are used by cling's testsuite and are not being installed with the standard llvm package. Cling (which depends on llvm and clang) is built as a clang tool to avoid unresolved dependencies to clang and complicating further the already complicated cmake setup.; ; This patch intends a minimal change and follows the initial (suboptimal) design to configure and build llvm, clang and cling as part of ROOT. An ultimate solution would be to have llvm, clang and cling built as separate standalone projects (following the recommended way by the LLVM cmake developers).

Safety,"FYI a related discussion from back then:. ""Should TTreeProcessor disable ParTreeProcessing once Process() is done? If so, maybe these functions should be an RAII instead of a pair of enable/disable (also to restore correctly to the *previous* state instead of enable/disable). This was discussed during the parallelisation meetings, and the point here is that it is safer to activate it the first time Process() is called and never deactivate it. The reason is people might call this method from different threads, and if we do activate-deactivate there could be interleaving of the two Process() calls. This could potentially deactivate the locks in one call when they are still needed in the other call. Sounds like you just need an atomic use count?

Safety,"Fix a debug assertion failure with `vector iterators incompatible` error on Windows in debug mode.; In `std::vector<Float_t>::const_iterator it = ev->GetValues().begin()`, `it` is initialised to `GetValues().begin()` and is then compared by `!=` to `GetValues().end()`. But `getValue()` returns a vector by value, not by reference, so it returns a copy, which means that every time we call `getValue()`, we get a different vector, so we get incompatible iterators. For the compiler, this does not make any difference. Type safety does not help, two iterators which belong to different container instances have the same type, so the code compiles. At run time, however, additional checks are made to ensure that two iterators that are being compared really belong to the same container object.

Safety,"For our users, it's important to fix certain parameters in the likelihood easily with any overhead. So far, this didn't work when using gradients from AD, because the gradients were only produced for the parameters that are floating at the time where the likelihood is created. However, it has no additional runtime overhead in backwards AD mode to simply generate the gradient for **all** parameters, and then filter out the right elements in the the RooMinimizer-related code. This is what is implemented in the second commit of this PR. Some changes in the RooAbsMinimizerFcn were necessary to do this filtering: so far it didn't store any information on all the parameters in order. It only stored two separate lists for floating and constant parameters. The first commit in this PR adds the necessary data members (`_allParams` and `_allParamsInit`) to the RooAbsMinimizerFcn for the filtering of parameters. Furthermore, the previous datamembers that stored the parameters separately are removed to avoid duplication and possible desync of information. On this occasion, the parameter management was completely rewritten to be more concise and robust. This will also help later when we integrate the discrete profiling from CMS combine, where changing the state and filtering of minimization parameters is also relevant. It was validated with the ATLAS and CMS likelihoods from ICHEP 2024 that this PR results in no performance regression, even though we are now generating the gradient for more parameters (roughly up to two times more, because for every floating nuisance parameter there is usually one constant global observable that constrains it).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750:1005,avoid,avoid,1005,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock.

Safety,"Hello! I see that your dataset has bins with negative weights. That's not a good start.; ![plot](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/6578603/f213df07-1c68-4453-9e6e-5f9cbb24787c); In newer ROOT versions, the Chi2 are more consistent with the likelihood fits. Meaning that if you have an extendible pdf, it will automatically do an extended fit (i.e., a Poisson term to constrain the number of predicted events is added). However, if you have weights this is not meaningful anymore. I guess you don't even want to do an extended fit in your case. You can explicitly pass `RooFit::Extended(false)` to get back the old behavior:; ```c++; using namespace RooFit;. TFile file{""test.root""};; auto workspace = file.Get<RooWorkspace>(""w_test"");. auto hist = static_cast<RooDataHist *>(workspace->data(""jpsi_ppbar_mass""));; auto x = workspace->var(""Jpsi_m_fitted"");; auto pdf = workspace->pdf(""model_Low"");. auto result = pdf->chi2FitTo(*hist, Save(), Extended(false));; result->Print();; ```. But your fit has also has a different problem (any status other than `MINIMIZE=0` means an error in Minuit). You use a [RooAddPdf](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAddPdf.html) for the model. This class inherits from RooAbsPdf, and a pdf in RooFit is forced to be positive everywhere. Therefore, you can't fit the your data with the negative bin contents at all. You need to create a RooAbsReal-derived function, maybe a [RooRealSumFunc](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooRealSumFunc.html). Or maybe can you avoid the negative bin content all together? Where does it even come from, from subtracting a background? IN this case this is the wrong thing do do for statistical analysis. I would rather keep the background in the data and add a component to the model, maybe a fixed [RooHistPdf](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooHistPdf.html) for that part that exactly corresponds to the background estimation.

Making the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware of the batchmode is the biggest challenge in this PR, as you have noticed.; Like Stephan suggested, I have tried no to pass as much information as possible in the constructors to hopefully avoid some of the new member variables I introduced here. In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter.

The limit is in the dCache storage system (xrootd.grid.surfsara.nl), not on the client side. This limit is there for a reason: it prevents the storage pools from being overloaded with transfers and crashing. When hadd tries to open all files at once, it tries to read more files concurrently than the limit per dCache storage pool allows. The first files are served, but the rest of the transfers are queued. This means, that they remain open but zero bytes are served, until some of the other transfers finish. But hadd never finishes those because it insists on reading from all files at the same time. So it gets stuck into a deadlock situation. If hadd would detect this situation (I'm getting data for some files but zero bytes for other files), it would make sense to stop reading all files concurrently, but instead continue reading from all files that it can, close those files, and then receive data for the other files. If hadd could do that, such a deadlock would be prevented, while performance would still be the maximum available.

Safety,"Hi @ynikitenko, thanks for the request! There are several reasons for not supporting PyPy. PyROOT, which is building on top of cppyy, is very deeply connected to the CPython implementation of CPyCppyy. Just like the CPython version of cppyy, PyROOT consists of a Python module and a compiled CPython extension (`libROOTPythonization`). And you can't use CPython extensions in PyPy. So to support PyPy, we would have to rewrite [all this code](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/src), and work closely with the cppyy team to make sure it's PyPy implementation also provides the interfaces that PyROOT expects. That would be a *huge* amount of work with no usecase to justify it. And there are so many alternative of fast analysis frameworks that people are trying out right now: RDataFrame, NumPy, numba, awkward arrays, etc. And let's not forget that pypy has it's limitations! It only supports a restricted subset of Python, and it would require large efforts to port PyROOT to this. One final point: the future of PyPy development is not very clear. Right now, they don't support Python 3.11 yet, for example. Builds are only available for [Python 3.9 and Python 3.10](https://www.pypy.org/download_advanced.html). So investing in PyPy compatibility is also risky because of that. Imagine we would spend half a year trying to support it, and then PyPy would not be maintained anymore :(.

Behind the scene such stuff relies on serialization/deserialization of objects via `pickle` or `dill`; 2. explicitely where I store my data into custom `shelve`-like database, that relies on serialization of objects via pickling. - for (1) I do not know if I can properly inject ""import ROOT"" into the code flow at all vital occurances. ; - for (2) of course I can pre-import `ROOT` for all manipulations with custom database, but it is rather unnatural solution.

To successfully integrate these developments, we should split the changes up into smaller PRs, as discussed in the RooFit weekly meeting. We could, for example, chunk it like this:. 1. First PR with changes to `math` only (`mathcore` and `minuit2`). Please ensure that no commit in this PR doesn't touch both math packages at the same time if not necessary. As far as I understood, the changes to `mathcore` and `minuit2` factorize, and you can make a commit for `mathcore` and then one or more for `minuit2`.; 2. Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3. Third PR with the rest, integrating the new `multiprocess` and `roofit/ZMQ` packages into RooFit. Feel free to split it up further if you think that's better. Some general things to consider in the new PRs:. * It seems unfeasible to rewrite the commit history in this PR to something that factorizes as proposed above.

Safety,"Hi Patrick, thanks for the explanation, things make more sense for me now! Interesting that you also experimented with making the full RooAbsMinimizer templated. I agree that making the RooAbsMinimizer a templated class is not the best solution, but I still think we can even avoid the templated constructor, making the code more clear and reducing compile time/binary size. You already have this nice `FcnMode` enum class which I think is great because enum class is typesafe while enum is not. Taking this enum, you could have a RooMinimizer constructor with the signature:; ```; RooMinimizer(RooAbsReal &function, FcnMode fcnMode);; ```; Then depending on `fcnMode`, you can create the correct function instance. You would not even have to check for the `logic_error`, because with the enum class is is ensured that the value is either `classic` or `gradient`.

Good point. I admit that did not really think to this case. > The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. > Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; > This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. I agree on this and TThreadedObject could be the place where to control this. The drawback is that we would then not have a solution outside TThreadedObject, i.e. we will have to find a way to force the use of TThreadedObject in MT cases. > A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock).

A package manager can install wherever it wants and can make its own; adjustment (simply copy over the two files, or put symlinks); this will; affect users building from source. I don't worry about package managers,; only about the latter users. As to 'how': the common case mixing; installations (e.g. from packagers and building from source), versions; (different pythons), system upgrades (that wipe out site-packages), or; simply a user doing 'rm -rf' for only half the installation. Users are; very, very inventive in creating trouble. :P None of that if all of ROOT; is kept in a single directory.

Debugging a setup problem is very time consuming and frustrating: the; error messages are spurious and only occur on the user's machine to which; I have no access.

Safety,"Hi,; I double-checked the behavior of `TTree::Draw` and `TTreeReader` when reading ""misaligned"" friends in a number of situations: as `TTrees`/`TChains`, friends longer/shorter than the main tree, friends with/without a `TTreeIndex`. With the path at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7131, which avoids an infinite loop with `TTreeReader` + indexed friend tree, `TTreeReader` and `TTree::Draw` behave the same in all cases except the one reported here. This means e.g. that switching from using a `TTree` to using a `TChain` to read the same data can change the number of entries `TTreeReader` reads in case of a friend that's larger than the main `TTree`. The problematic logic is that of `TTree::LoadTree(entry)`, which does not return an error if `entry` is larger than the number of entries in the main tree as long as the friend tree has enough entries (again note that `TChain` behaves differently, ending the event loop as soon as the main tree entries are over, and `TTree/TChain::Draw` also behaves like that). In particular, these lines are what causes `TTree::LoadTree` to not return an error:. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/8d616f45e399d3a918b6a78edf98aa54219eb5d2/tree/tree/src/TTree.cxx#L6447-L6452. <hr>.

Safety,"Hmm that's not good that you get a crash like this. The thing is that the `RooArgSet` and `RooArgList` created with the constructor where you pass multiple elements are non-owning collections, so they should never passed temporaries. It is also possible to have an owning RooArgList/Set, but in this case it would own all the elements and it would not cover the case where you pass a mix of temporaries and non-temporaries. A possible solution would be to have a mechanism that detects which arguments need to be owned and which not, but I think that would be too convoluted and not really necessary. However, we can easily change it such that you get a nice exception with useful information text if the RooArgSet/List constructor detects that one argument is a temporary.

How does CMake find ROOT, but not VDT in the same location?

Safety,"Hmmh, but then I'd need to stream path information with every REveText object, now only the font name is streamed. It is indeed a reasonable thing to check if the font files exist before object's json is sent over to the client --- but creating a font during the streaming traversal would be pushing it a bit. Is it possible to register custom prefixes and callbacks from REveManager (via RWebWindow) so they can be handled when requests come in? Like: http://server/sdf-fonts/. I went through the code a bit (but clearly do not have the full picture) ... one way would be to add THttpServer::fActiveLocations, where instead of replacement string one provides a lambda [](TString& prefix, TString& reminder, THttpRequest& req, THttpServer &srv) so one can then do appropriate lookup in the callback, potentially generating the font, and then calling srv->SendFile() (or sending back the default font, if the desired one can not be found/generated). I think this functionality could be useful for other cases in REve, where semi-static data needs to be provided. The font-generation code in REveText invokes TGL generator through the interpreter now, via gROOT->ProcessLine(), to avoid dependency of REve on RGL.

Safety,"I am a little concerned about the basic idea. If I understood correctly, there is a (unique) global registry where the histogram are identified based on their 'full path name' (beside the fact that GetNameForRanges seems both brittle and currently seems on first reading 'wrong'/'not-as-intended'). I see two major problems, one is that the 'full path name' may never be really unique i.e. it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it *seems* to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. And that remind me, that another challenge for the 'unique registry' solution is to understand its scalability where reaching 10 to 100 thousands histograms.

Safety,"I am not sure how we can fix this issue. The cmake `ExternalProject_Add` is meant to operate on projects which are not changed in tree. There seems to be an option: BUILD_ALWAYS <bool> which says "" Enabling this option forces the build step to always be run. This can be the easiest way to robustly ensure that the external project's own build dependencies are evaluated rather than relying on the default success timestamp-based method. This option is not normally needed unless developers are expected to modify something the external project's build depends on in a way that is not detectable via the step target dependencies (e.g. SOURCE_DIR is used without a download method and developers might modify the sources in SOURCE_DIR)."". That would fix this problem but introduce another one -- clad would be rebuilt every time one types `make`. ROOT has good amount of uses of `ExternalProject_Add` and that kind of issue is not only specific to clad. .

The type does not matter since we are only working with bytes but we should use only one to avoid all the casting that we find across the code base. ## TODO; - Decide what type should be given for `tgtsize` and `srcsize`. The most suitable could be unsigned but perhaps in some section of the code a negative value is used to represent something.; - Instead of using `&irep` for returning information about the compressed size or possible errors better make that the function instead of being void is int so the return value would be `&irep`.; - ZLIB right now does not have separated files but it is embedded inside RZIP what is not desirable. It would be better to make it follow the same structure of LZ4 or LZMA.; - What is the current value of maintaining the legacy algorithm (from 1990) of ROOT compression?

Safety,"I figured out the reason of my apparent 'instability' in results. Rather than a problem with the ROOT build, it was actually a variation in the way I generated/created the library needed to emulated the ATLAS libraries. The original 2 files contains respectively 1 and 2 ATLAS classes derived from the RooAbsPdf and because the objects of that type are added to a compiled list, they must be created properly (otherwise you get type detection errors .. in part because RooAbsPdf is an abstract class). In order to generate this library, I use TFile::MakeProject (which almost works, I have to add an implementation for the abstract functions by hand). Part of the this MakeProject is to generate a LinkDef file. Because the output of MakeProject should not depend on the ROOT version, I generated the libraries with an arbitrary version of ROOT (and did not pay attention which one at the time, but it was different on different machine and upon seeing the weird crash, I may have regenerated the project on the machine I was using at the time). The issue is that a particular commit (e8eb7875c73ea00bedf11c022a055d50ec5f081d, part of the new PR) change whether the dictionary was requested (in the LinkDef file) for the pair that was causing the problem (pair<string,RooArgSet>) ... and having an explicit dictionary for that pair works around the problem introduced by the first wave of pair related changes. .

Safety,"I see your issue with thread safety. However, your proposed solutions will not work for the following reasons. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys depends on the environment variable ROOTSYS (as does the others since they depend on GetRootSys). If the static variables are assigned at initialization time, these assignments will be done when the program is loaded before the program starts. But at this point the value of the ROOTSYS environment variable is not always set to the correct value. If the program is started without ROOTSYS set, TUnixSystem::Init will initialize it. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys must therefore be done after this. I have added calls to all the functions in the TROOT constructor, after the call to InitSystem. This way all the static variables get assigned by the TROOT constructor (which I believe is run single threaded). All subsequent calls to the functions will then not change the value of the static variables and are therefore thread safe.

Safety,"I tested offline @hahnjo 's proposal, as it would have had the nice advantage of avoiding the backwards-incompatible change brought by the current status of this PR. A summary of the insights I gathered:. 1. There are some technical obstacles, the main one being that we don't have a single, coherent code path for all data sources. Crucially, `TTree` is handled differently from any other data format (i.e. it doesn't use the `RDataSource` mechanism). This practically means that I cannot create a lazy `RDataSource` to handle them all. But in first approximation this could have been solved with one extra branching; 2. It is not straightforward to know where exactly to trigger the inferring of the data source. Practically, this is needed at the very latest in `RLoopManager::Run`, i.e. right before the start of the event loop. But it can also be needed before that, namely whenever a node of the computation graph is created it might need to know about the column names it uses, so the dataset schema must be gathered thus the data source type must be inferred. Admittedly, this is also another fixable problem with a better documentation or cleaner code to explain exactly at what point of any RDataFrame application the loop manager would need the dataset schema in place; 3. Probably the greatest obstacle posed by this idea is that it indeed fixes one backwards-incompatible change, but introduces another one. RDataFrame allows some operations to run without triggering the computation graph, actually without even needing to populate the computation graph at all. Specifically, `Describe` produces a string description of some metadata of the dataset wrapped by the RDataFrame, e.g. the name of the TTree and the file it is stored in. This info doesn't need file opening (at least with `TChain`). The lazy data source would effectively change the behaviour of `Describe` as it would hide the type of the data source even if in principle it could be known (supposing the same workflow with ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672:81,avoid,avoiding,81,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672,1,['avoid'],['avoiding']

We see this for example when during an RDF distributed execution HTCondor workers (""pilot processes"") are spawned and subsequent tasks that need to compile macros/code cells are executed by them. However, if I understand correctly, we could avoid completely all code interpretation (which can be thread unsafe and memory consuming) after the first compilation of the macro/code cell. This could be achieved if we had in place a thread safe mechanism to recognise the code to be compiled, and, if already compiled within the same process, not compiled again, e.g. some hashing, instead of the current time stamp check (not like ccache, but somehow being inspired by it). Then a worker would behave as follows:; - first task: compile macro and load library; - second task: hash macro code, and, if already compiled, no-op; - ...; - n-th task: hash macro code, and, if already compiled, no-op; This would have the advantage of being manageable from the thread-safety point of view and consume just the memory necessary to interpret the macro once.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13655#issuecomment-1762173995:431,avoid,avoid,431,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13655#issuecomment-1762173995,4,"['avoid', 'safe', 'unsafe']","['avoid', 'safe', 'safety', 'unsafe']"

Safety,"Idea to create separate actions list, which will be used only for text-based streaming.; Most actions functions can be reused from normal I/O, ; only several cases should be implemented slightly different. On the long run one could create complimentary actions list for reading data with TBufferXML or TBufferSQL2 and fully isolate text-based and binary I/O. That is in PR:; - creating separate list **fWriteText,** now used only with JSON; - provide new method TStreamerInfo::AddWriteTextAction() to fill actions list; - actions build from the full list of class members (avoid compressed members); - provide specialized actions for kTNamed, kTObject, kSTLp and kStreamLoop; - make actions for kSTLp and kStreamLoop with template parameter isText, potentially can be reused in binary I/O. PR solves several existing problem with JSON:; - TNamed and TObject as direct data members; - correct store of kSTLp members with arrays; - kStreamLoop member with fCounter==0; - kStreamLoop member with fCounter==1; - rudimentary support for TRef; - store dummy TObject instance.

Btw, if you have suggestions there of how to construct a better test, I'm all ears. What the failing test does is: 1. assign task priorities, 2. run the tasks and record the order in which they are executed, 3. check the received order against the suggested one via the priorities. The problem is that due to random OS process scheduling delays, the received order is never 100% predictable. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if it has multiple tasks in the queue at one time that it will execute the one with highest priority first.
