Modifiability,"Partial fix of #8708.; In a setup where ROOT was installed in a system directory, ROOT was picking up headers from that directory instead of its own. . ## How to reproduce:; 1. `echo '#error This is the wrong header' > /my/include/directory/RooSpan.h` (or a few other headers).; 2. Install some builtins into that directory, e.g. VDT; 3. `cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/my/include/directory/ <root>` to create a dependency to that include directory.; 4. Build. The problem only becomes visible when `A` depends on `B and C`, and `B` depends on something in `/system/include/`, and `C` is installed in those system includes as well. This generates a compile command such as:; ```; -I.../core/x -I.../core/y -I.../core/... -I.../A/include -I.../B/include -I/system/include/ -I.../C/include ...; ```. ## In this PR:; - Includes for VDT and XROOTD are fixed by making them `IMPORTED` targets, so their includes have lowest precedence.; - Some cheating where include directories are copied around between targets is removed. CMake should handle this.; - Some dependency and target management is simplified (or rather modernised with target-based cmake); - A broken dependency in RooFit is fixed, which was previously hidden by the cheating with include directories. ## What remains to be done:; It is likely that more builtins (or rather `FindXXX` have to be converted to `IMPORTED` targets, so they don't provoke this error again. A broken configuration can be detected by; 1. Having CMake pick up a dependency in some common directory; 2. Either; - Placing a lot of `#error`-ROOT headers in there or; - Searching `compile_commands.json` for `-I/my/include/directory/`; 3.

Modifiability,"Probably due to historical reasons, the Minuit2 code uses several systems to report errors, warnings, and debug info. Some of these only work when certain compile flags are set (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). I would like to unify these systems and use the MnPrint facilities consistently everywhere. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:779,Variab,VariableMetricBuilder,779,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,2,['Variab'],"['VariableMetric', 'VariableMetricBuilder']"

Modifiability,"RDataFrame currently has internal mechanisms to merge the partial results coming from different thread executions when running with IMT.; There is no possibility though to merge such results in a distributed environment, where the various chunks of the dataset are processed separately on different machines.; In this PR I propose a possible implementation of such feature, given the following requirements:; * The standard RDataFrame API should not be altered, i.e. first and foremost there should be no changes in the types pointed to by RResultPtr.; * To be truly portable, the result of the RDataFrame execution should know how to merge itself with another result of the same type and the result of the merge operation should still know how to merge again. To this end, a new function called `GetMergeableValue` takes as input an RResultPtr<T> , e.g. the last action node of the graph, and returns an `RMergeableValue<T>*`, a new class that satisfies the previous requirements. The choice of creating a new class instead of, for example, returning the standard return value plus a function to merge two values of that type, has to do with the second requirement above.; In fact, while this could be feasible with the return value of a `Count` operation (the merge function would just be the sum of the two count values), it would not be enough for all operations.; Notably, to merge results of two `Mean` operations we would need also the counts of each mean to merge them as a weighted mean, so the function would take 4 parameters of which at most 2 are known beforehand (the mean and the counts of the action that is currently being examined by the GetMergeableValue function), while the other 2 parameters wouldn't be known until the user tries to perform the Merge on the two values.

Modifiability,"RooFit currently includes the `RooCBShape` and `RooDSCBShape` to; represent the family of crystal ball distributions.

To make the RooFit code more maintainable and also cover the use case; of an asymmetric Gaussian core, this commit implements a new; `RooCrystalBall` class that should cover all classes of crystal ball; shapes, such that `RooCBShape` and `RooDSCBShape` are in principle not; necessary anymore. The new features of the `RooCrystalBall` class that make it different; from `RooDSCBShape` are:. - possibility to set sigma of left side and right side of Gaussian; core separately. - code modernization and using `std::` math functions. - three constructors: fully parametrized, symmetric Gaussian core; (to replace `RooDSCBShape`), only left tail (to replace; `RooCBShape`). - useage of inlined helper functions to avoid code duplication. It is also carefully tested in `testRooCrystalBal`:. - test the fully parameterized case. - test the constructor for left-tail only case and compare values; with `RooCBShape`. - test the constructor with symmetric Gaussian core and compare; values with `RooDSCBShape`. - test the constructor for right-tail only and symmetric tails. - test integration with many possible combinations integration; ranges to cover all branches of integration code",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257:453,maintainab,maintainable,453,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257,2,"['maintainab', 'parameteriz']","['maintainable', 'parameterized']"

Modifiability,"Root has two different ways to configure the build - the traditional configure script and cmake. The builds generated by the two systems are similar, but far from equivalent. Historically the configure script has been more feature complete and some things that the configure script is able to do are either missing or broken in the cmake build. However, new features are often only added to the cmake build. This has resulted in that today neither of the two is able to build root with a complete set of features. The cmake build is more standard and behaves in a more predictive way, e.g. it understands CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and friends which the configure script never did. It also integrates the test suite in the build and allows for running ""make test"", a feature that the configure script is missing. So the cmake build is in many ways better, if it wasn't for those missing and broken things mentioned earlier.

Modifiability,"Some libraries are layered can depend on other libraries on a private paths. That is, libA can depend on libB which is neither on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH nor on a known system path. The posix linker injects ""variables"" such as @rpath which is expanded at link time to resolve the libraries on a relative path. Prior to this patch, cling's Dyld-based symbol resolution could not trace down such cases causing failures in symbol resolution when a symbol is only defined in libB (a private library). This patch implements the basic posix linker substitutions allowing cling's Dyld-based symbol resolution implementation to follow more closely the linker rules. ## Performance. |platform|test|master|PRv1|PRv2| mem master|mem PRv2|; |:--------|:---|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|; |ubu20|roottest-python-pythonizations|6.5|6.55|6.65|342076|347168|; |ubu20|roottest-cling|112.8|114.53|181.26|411048|416036|; |ubu20|roottest-python|148.5|136.26|144.72|394292|397120|; |ubu20|roottest-root-hist|16.78|17.35|15.45|465156|235084|; |ubu20|roottest-root-math|28.28|27.89|27.40|424072|371256|; |ubu20|roottest-root-tree|462.84|510.59|465.79|796512|797992|; |ubu20|roottest-root-treeformula|117.53|129.16|114.44|261184|260168|; |ubu20|root-io-stdarray|66.90|67.89|65.71|263424|255120|; |ubu20|roottest-root-treeformula|117.55|129.10|; |osx 10.15|roottest-python-pythonizations|17.25|16.06|; |osx 10.15|roottest-cling|346.06|343.46|; |osx 10.15|roottest-root-hist|36.06|36.22|; |osx 10.15|roottest-root-math|49.78|52.42|; |osx 10.15|root-io-stdarray|119.32|118.73|.

It uses an optimized formula to do the interpolation on the; fly. The `FlexibleInterpVar` however precomputes and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays.

Modifiability,"The ctor of `GSLMCIntegrator` creates a `GSLRngWrapper` instance on the heap and calls its `Allocate()` member function which in turn allocates memory for a GSL random number generator via `gsl_rng_alloc()`. When the `GSLMCIntegrator` instance goes out of scope, its dtor is invoked which deletes the `GSLRngWrapper` pointer and thus invokes its dtor as well. However, `~GSLRngWrapper()` frees the allocated memory only if `fOwn` pointer is set to true, which is only set so in the assignment operator, but not in the `Allocate()` member function. Therefore, the `GSLMCIntegrator` class is leaking memory. This poses a problem, when doing a large number of integrations inside a for loop.

In root-project/root@9b2041e3 we have kept the logic but now the JIT started querying more often even for symbols which are okay to be missing.

Modifiability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings. The new name,; RDefine, clearly describes what the class is supposed to do and it is in; line with RDF's naming convention (we already have RFilter).

This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```.

The values in the tests were extracted directly from the mentioned implementations, showing that the LCG implementation is equivalent to the RANLUX algorithm.

Modifiability,"These useful tests are relatively short (runtime 28 seconds in total) and test lower-level RooFit functionality. Moving them from roottest to roofit has the following benefits:. * Faster RooFit development experience: it's not necessary anymore to also add and compile all of `roottest`, if you want to make sure locally that the vectorized pdf tests always compile and pass. * The vectorized pdf tests will be able to consider the RooFit-internal preprocessor macros at build time, like `ROOFIT_CUDA` and `ROOFIT_LEGACY_EVAL_BACKEND`. Like this we can ensure that the tests will pass no matter how RooFit was configured at compile time.

Modifiability,"This PR adds `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, an alternative to `RooMinimizerFcn` that calculates gradient itself outside of Minuit during minimization. To be able to use `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, `RooMinimizer` had to be refactored to be able to use `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instead of the concrete RooMinimizerFcn class. To accomodate this change, several other changes had to be made:; - `_optConst` and `_func` members were removed, since these are now managed by the `*MinimizerFcn`.; - This means also things like function name and title, but also optimization switches, were moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet.

This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2.

Modifiability,"This Pull request refactors `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` to coalesce the fetch requests for pages in the same cluster bunch before calling `RDaosContainer::ReadV`, instead of launching a call to remote storage for the pages of each cluster separately. A cluster bunch corresponds to all clusters being fetched together by `LoadClusters()` at a time. . Since the call by `ReadV()` is ultimately blocking until all requests are done, this change enables the asynchronous page fetch requests from different clusters to share queue and flight time; thus, remote storage can parallelize them toward a higher read throughput. . The requests are still coalesced according to object ID and distribution key resulting from the mapping strategy in `kDefaultDaosMapping`.

Modifiability,"This commit provides a rewrite of key functions of TGeoParallelWorld, achieving: . (a) faster initialization; (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) ; (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) ; (d) less memory consumption (better memory scalability). The development for this commit was motivated from a use case in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal i",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:23,rewrite,rewrite,23,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

Modifiability,"This commit provides the possibility to pass system library search paths as well as some compiler include paths to ROOT as environment variables.; This has the advantage that ROOT will spawn less sub-processes and we can do the setup only once, instead of doing it for every single executable that is linked to ROOT. The commit does not change any default behaviour! Rather, expert-users may use the new feature by moving the initialization of the search paths to say software environment loading. In ALICE, we do something like. ```; export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=$(LD_DEBUG=libs LD_PRELOAD=DOESNOTEXIST ls /tmp/DOESNOTEXIST 2>&1 | grep -m 1 ""system search path"" | sed 's/.*=//g' | awk '//{print $1}'). export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=$(LC_ALL=C c++ -xc++ -E -v /dev/null 2>&1 | sed -n '/^.include/,${/^ \/.*++/{p}}' | tr '\n' ':' | tr ' ' ':'); ```. speeding up the initialization of our executables at runtime and doing less syscalls that create short-lived processes, for instance calling the compiler. The effect from this operation can be seen by counting the `execve` syscalls in a small example:. ```; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 14 calls. export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=...; export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=...; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 6 calls; ```.

Modifiability,"This commit removes some functions from the RooFit data classes:. * `RooAbsData::valid()` (virtual method that was overridden in; RooDataHist but not RooDataSet). * `RooDataHist::valid(std::size_t i)` and `RooDataHist::valid()`. * `RooDataHist::cacheValidEntries()`. The `cacheValidEntries` method was originally intended to be used in; `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` to mask histogram entries out of the variable; range in case of a subrange fit. The reasons why `cacheValidEntries` and; the related `valid()` methods should be removed are:. 1. It is redundant. In a subrange fit, the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` is; creating a clone of the dataset with the subrange only using; `RooAbsData::reduce()`. So all entries are valid by definition. 2. RooDataHist and RooDataSet have inconistent implementations. For; the RooDataHist, `valid()` tells you ""if bin `i` is considered; valid within the current range definitions of all observables""; (according to the documentation). For the RooDataSet, it always; returns `true`. This inconsistency leaves plenty of room for error. 3. The masking of out-of-range entries unnessecarily increases the; `mutable` state of the RooDataHist, which can cause trouble if one; updates the observable range but then forgets to call; `cacheValidEntries()`. 4.

The old way consisted in operating file by file, obtaining a TTree from each file and then constructing a TTreeReader for the particular range a task was going to process in that TTree. The aforementioned implementation prevented the support for friend chains, since there was no chain to add the friends to, only trees. In this new implementation, TTreeProcessorMT always constructs a chain per TTreeView, from which TTreeReaders are created to operate on ranges of the chain.

Modifiability,"This is a follow-up to 15a14ae6b4c. The `FindCUDA` module is deprecated since CMake 3.10 and the mentioned; commit therefore removed the usage of it.

This was fine for RooFit, but TMVA not only compiles sources with the; NVidia compiler but also uses the CUDA toolkit in regular C++. Therefore, that commit broke the TMVA GPU features. Unfortunately, I didn't notice before, because of this check; in `cmake/modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake`:; ```cmake; if(tmva-gpu AND NOT CUDA_FOUND); set(tmva-gpu OFF CACHE BOOL ""Disabled because cuda not found"" FORCE); endif(); ```. The `CUDA_FOUND` variable is not set anymore now that `FindCUDA` is not; used. That means that `tmva-gpu` was silently disabled, and not building; successfully (which I had wrongly concluded because of the absence of; errors). This check needs to be replaced with; `if( NOT CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER)`. As recommended in the CMake docs, this should be done with the; `FindCUDAToolkit` module, which is what this PR suggests. The `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` command is also replaced with the regular; `add_executable`, because `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` was also deprecated with; `FindCUDA`. Furthermore, all `cuda AND tmva-gpu` checks were replaced with only; `tmva-gpu`, because `tmva-gpu` implies `cuda`. Finally, `stressTMVA` is moved to the `tmva` subdirectory so that it is built in the same cmake project as ROOT; itself, so that we can query the `tmva-gpu` and `tmva-cpu` flags.

Modifiability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable.

Modifiability,"This is done to better separate CUDA-specific code from the generic code; in RooBatchCompute. Two problems are addressed in this commit:. 1. The RooBatchCompute library had too many CUDA specific functions. The virtual RooBatchCompute interface should be backend agnostic, but; it had CUDA specific functions like `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`,; which where only implemented in the CUDA case. So an abstraction; didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics; to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library; are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor; macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. These types are only; available to `nvcc`, and in case gcc is used, these were forward; declared as stucts. This is a hack that should be avoided. In; particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the; same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`; pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,; and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function; should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`; directly. This parameter is removed. Now, the CUDA stream is stored; in a `RooBatchCompute::Config` struct that is passed around in the; `DataMap`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409:1398,Config,Config,1398,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409,1,['Config'],['Config']

The update to the Davix configuration should not be controversial, I just added arguments forcing Davix to use the same LibXml2 library found by ROOT as well. The update to VDT is a bit weirder though. 😦 Unfortunately VDT executes a python script simply by calling `python <script>` during the CMake configuration. If there is not `python` executable in `$PATH` at this time, that fails. Now, ideally the `python` name should not be hardcoded into the VDT code at all, it should be set dynamically to whatever [FindPythonInterp](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindPythonInterp.html) finds as `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`.

Modifiability,"This is two bugs, really: . 1) Inside the ""do while"" loop at line 243 of TTreeReaderArray.cxx, the ""parent"" string never changes which results in the loop never exiting. Changing line 243 from: ; `parent = parent.substr(0, posLastDot);`; to; `parent = parent.substr(0, posLastDotParent);`; will restore the original intent of the code, I believe. 2) In the same loop as above, for leaf names that include ""."" characters, this loop will never properly find the correct leaf name to initialize the array size. (The change above in part 1 will not fix this.); For example: If my array is named something like: ""a.b.c[d.e.f]"" where ""a.b.c"" is the array name and ""d.e.f"" is the name of array length int, the logic in the loop will never find the correct leaf size. One could rewrite the logic such that every combination of characters in between "".""'s are tried, but this would be a bit complicated and cumbersome. Instead... Proposed change: Add an overloaded function call for TTreeReaderArray for the user to specify the array-length leaf name:; `TTreeReaderArray<float> myArr(treeReader, ""arrayLeafName"", ""arrayLengthLeafName"")`.

Modifiability,"This problem affects multi-range fits with `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and was; reported in Jira issue [ROOT-9530](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9530). Each RooNLLVar was created with the normalization set corresponding to; the subrange, not the union range like it should be. This commit adds an; extra term to the final likelihood function to cancel this normalization; problem. The extra term doesn't have to be added for the extended fit, because; adding extension terms for the likelihoods in each range as currently; done is mathematically equivalent to applying the normalization correction term; plus adding a global extension term. I'm not sure if I should call this a bug or not. On the one hand, the result that was computed previously was not wrong, it just didn't use all the information (relative number of events in each subrange was not considered). On the other hand, the result was not the best possible estimate given the information in all sub-ranges, and users expects the maximum likelihood estimate to be the best estimate available given the information.

Modifiability,"This proposed new Strategy in minuit2 is the same migrad behaviour as Strategy=2 but with the following changes to the Hesse calculation:; * The step and g2 tolerances have been zeroed so that the 7 cycles are forced in the diagonal-term calculation. This was found to be necessary in cases where asimov datasets were used for the minimization and there were very few iterations for the approximate covariance to be determined from. ; * Central finite difference is used for mixed partial derivatives. This requires 3 extra function evaluations per derivative, but is necessary in the case of minima where there is high curvature (in the case of high stats) and the forward finite difference (default) behaviour leads incorrectly to a non-positive-definite covariance matrix; * Return the uncorrected covariance matrix, even if it is not positive definite. This useful for checking just how far from positive-definiteness the matrix is by being able to examine the eigenvalues. . Additionally, a lower bound on the precision allowed for the spread of eigenvalues of the ""hessian"" correlation matrix (computing a correlation matrix with the hessian as if it was a covariance matrix) was reduced from 1e-6 to 1e-12 (see MnHesse.cxx) ... it is not clear why 1e-6 was the lower bound previously, but current machine precision can beat that (I get locally 1e-8). I left a comment about whether this lower bound should be made configurable or not...

The pull-request includes a source tarball (allowing a ""builtin_lz4"" option in CMake analogous to ""builtin_lzma""). I am unable to test this on Windows currently. The LZ4 algorithm focuses on decompression speed while sacrificing compression ratio. Compression level < 4 uses the ""LZ4 compression"" algorithm while compression level >= 4 uses ""LZ4HC"" (HC = high compression) variant. LZ4HC is comparable to zlib in speeds, but has approximately 20% larger file size. To evaluate, I use the Event executable in the test/ directory. I extend this to allow the compression algorithm be specified via CLI. Example invocation:. time ./Event 4000 6 99 1 1000 4; time ./Event 4000 4 99 0 1000 4.

Modifiability,"This should be the last crop of fixes needed by ROOT-10216. In brief, the changes are to replace lookup by simpler search to avoid nested; initialization of TClasses (leading to the outer nested initialization; to end using deleted memory).

Solution: replace raw pointer by a TClassRef. TCompInfo::Update did a TClass::GetClass for all type that were not classes :(; Usually it is just a waste of time.; In this case, one such type is User::TContext::Time (an enum) use as part; of User::TContext .. Consequently, before the dictionary TClass for User::TContext was constructed,; another class requested the update of the emulated StreamerInfo for the (still); emulated User::TContext, this in turn provoked the (unnecessary) call to; TClass::GetClass on ‘User::TContext::Time’ which provoked the creation of; the TClass for User::TContext … one of the steps is to absorb the existing; StreamerInfo (including the one being updated) and clear them (i.e. delete; the TCompInfo array) … upon return the result of the TClass::GetClass (a nullptr); is stored in deleted memory.

Modifiability,"This somewhat huge commit mainly demotes many class-versions to 0. . If wanted, I can for sure squash some things (right now, the commit messages contain the underlying reasoning). . In ROOT, a lot of classes were equipped with class-versions > 0 even though they are not meant for IO / streaming. ; This produces unnecessary overhead (creation of Streamer() functions) and might be misleading for users (especially if they believe streaming of these classes would be ok and then lose parts of their data). That's even more helpful when testing framework's dataobject-code. . These classes were identified by https://github.com/olifre/rootStaticAnalyzer (a new project still in early stages) and I have created this PR to fix almost all these issues. . The last commit in the series also explicitly marks two members (of TSeqCollection and THashList) as transient, even though these classes are already class-version 0. This is purely to make it more explicit that these are not streamed - and allow for programmatic testing (since then the `kTransient` bit of the `TRealData` will be set correctly). . Several issues alerted by `rootStaticAnalyzer` still remain which are probably real bugs in ROOT 6. . Examples: . ```; TMVA/PDF.h:0: error: Data object class 'TMVA::PDF' will not stream the following indirect members: members 'fConfigName, fConfigDescription, fReferenceFile' from class 'TMVA::Configurable' (class-version 0)!; ```.

Both call `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` which results in a warning (this should be fixed separately). `TestSupport.cxx` has a `ForbidDiagnostics noDiagCheckerInstance` that should call `SetErrorHandler` and fail the test if there is an unexpected diagnostic. It turns out this works fine for `ntuple_extended` (which is currently failing in configurations without IMT), but not for `ntuple_storage`. The reason seems to be that `ntuple_storage` doesn't use any other code from `ROOT::TestSupport`, and because it's a static library (since https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9528) the linker can just skip it. (This was different for the object library before, there you link in the individual object files.). I'm not sure what the best solution is: Is it possible and reasonable to install object libraries?

Modifiability,"Up to now all ES6 modules were loaded with relative path like `./jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs`. ; This works nice when all used code is located in one sub-directory `./jsrootsys/` which is alias for `$ROOTSYS/js`.; But this does not work when other location has to be used and modules have to reference jsroot code. Solution provided by modern browsers is `importmap` which can look like:; ```; <script type=""importmap"">; {; ""imports"": {; ""jsroot"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs"",; ""jsroot/draw"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/draw.mjs"",; ""jsroot/io"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/io.mjs"",; ""jsrootsys/"" :: ""./jsrootsys/""; }; }; ```. This allow to use `import { draw } from 'jsroot';` syntax - including different external modules. Therefore add support of ""importmap"" in `THttpServer` which automatically insert appropriate map if `<!--jsroot_importmap-->` comment appears in HTML file. . Old HTML files with JSROOT import via relative path will work as before. ; But newer JSROOT HTML files with absolute path will not work with older ROOT versions - may be backport to 6.32 and 6.30 can be done later. Special handling of Qt5 is provided - while used there chromium version does not support importmap :(. ; Nevertheless all ROOT web widgets will be working. Provide `tutorials/webgui/custom` demo with usage of user-defined modules for support of custom user classes `TTriangle`. Demo should run witth ACLiC to provide dictionary for the class. Several changes in TWebCanvas and RWebWindowsManager class were done to let configure custom modules paths and register custom classes.; Macro also works in batch mode where workaround has to be implemented - until headless browser will allow to use ES6 modules directly from the file system.

That's why it's better to avoid this dependency if we can, also to minimize the dependency of RooFit on the interface level.

We can also return a `std::vector<std::string>` here. I already talked with @Zeff020 about this change, and he is completely fine with it. The class was also only used by the RooFit Multiprocess developers so far, so changing the interface is fine.

Modifiability,"[skip-ci]. # This Pull request:. Makes the CI load OpenStack object-store credentials from files on runners instead of using GitHub secrets. When `pull_request` is a workflow trigger, the job can't access secrets, which means that the S3 secret token is unavailable. Adding S3 credentials to the runners themselves solves this issue. The OpenStack credentials are defined [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-lcgapp/-/blob/rootci_test/code/manifests/build/root.pp#L43) (using [teigi](https://configdocs.web.cern.ch/secrets/adding.html)). If a malicious actor makes a PR with a job to print the credentials, or to upload a malicious artifact, it would still have to be approved by a maintainer. A safer alternative is not allowing pull request jobs to upload artifacts at all but then we can't run tests in a separate job. It would also cause builds to take more time on average because the object storage will be less populated. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201:508,config,configdocs,508,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201,1,['config'],['configdocs']

It can now only read repository (when PR commenting is getting implemented it has to run in a separate workflow anyways); - Re-enables output buffering to improve performance, at the cost of stderr being redirected to stdout.

Modifiability,"_Originally posted by @guitargeek in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7859#issuecomment-824967292_. > Hi @hageboeck! For the schema evolution from the previous version, I just made a test myself where I wrote a RooDataHist to a file with ROOT 6.24 and read it back with ROOT master + this PR. Do you think I should implement a unit test for that? I didn't think this was necessary, after all the change is rather trivial (removal of `_realVars` class member). I see that I never really replied to the above:; Yes, I think that kind of a test like this makes sense. Consider this:; - stressRooFit has a reference file that reads in some RooFit objects. This kind of serves as a schema evolution test, but that's more by accident than by design.; - The reference file evolves with ROOT, though! When you find that small things have to be changed, you recreate the reference file by running `./stressRooFit` with the correct arguments.; - Now you are not testing 6.2[02] schema evolution, but whatever was in master when you created that reference. This is not a good and stable test.; - Here's a test suite that tests the I/O of categories across several ROOT versions. It's trivial to extend it by creating another reference file and adding it to the test suite:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2ef9c05a04b4e65d68923737bf115e5410ddf6c3/roofit/roofitcore/test/testProxiesAndCategories.cxx#L57-L130. So the answer is:; It would be preferable to have a similar test to what I pasted above for RooDataHist. A stub is already here for RooDataHistv4:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2ef9c05a04b4e65d68923737bf115e5410ddf6c3/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooDataHist.cxx#L183-L239. By making it a value-parametrised test as for the categories, you could instantiate it very quickly for all RooDataHist versions.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8037:777,evolve,evolves,777,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8037,2,"['evolve', 'extend']","['evolves', 'extend']"

Modifiability,"_This PR is not intended to be merged into ROOT! That's why it's a draft!_. The purpose of this PR is to show which private members I had to make public to access RNTuple in a BulkIO style. Two of these changes were just to parameterize the cluster and page sizes:. * `fClusterSizeEntries` was made public so that I could set it and make it apples-to-apples with the other formats.; * `kDefaultElementsPerPage = 2097152` is large, but 8× less than the maximum size that can be compressed. The maximum is `0xffffff` because the header provides 3 bytes to specify the uncompressed size, so that uncompressed size can't exceed that. The number I chose here is `2**21`, which is 8× below that limit, to allow for 8-byte integers and floating point numbers. What's probably missing here is the logic for splitting the data to be compressed into a series of blocks with this maximum size. (TTree and normal serialized objects do that.). The rest of the changes are just turning private/protected members into public ones so that they can be read directly in a BulkIO style. Here's how that's done: suppose you're filling a buffer named `array` using a `view` of type `V` returned by `GetViewCollection` or `GetView<T>`. We know the `length` of elements to read, so the function is. ```c++; template <typename V, typename T>; void read_from_rntuple_view(T* buffer, V& view, int64_t& offset, int64_t length) {; int64_t current = 0;; while (current < length) {; T* data = (T*)view.fField.Map(offset + current);; int32_t num = view.fField.fPrincipalColumn->fCurrentPage.GetNElements();; int32_t skipped = (offset + current) - view.fField.fPrincipalColumn->fCurrentPage.GetGlobalRangeFirst();; int32_t remaining = num - skipped;; if (current + remaining > length) {; remaining = length - current;; }; if (remaining > 0) {; std::memcpy(&buffer[current], data, remaining*sizeof(T));; }; current += remaining;; }; offset += current;; }; ```.

That means, the direct value server `par_mod` is **skipped** now,; misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the; `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it; wrong. That's why this commit suggests to change the logic in `RooRealIntegral`; to always add the next direct value servers that don't depend on the; integration variable, and not the leaves. A unit test that verifies that the value servers of the integral are the; mathematically direct value servers and not the computation graph leaves; is also implemented. Closes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578.

One could try fixing it instead of disabling it but the code which is used to install the lookup handler in the module `RootModule::SetRootLazyLookup` depends on internal CPython implementation details of the dict class which are not part of the public API. As a consequence keeping this alive will lead to very; fragile code, require continuous effort to adapt to internal changes and cause a lot of #ifdef handling. (as a matter of fact, Python 3.7 would probably already require new changes to this code already). . Also there's a statement in the bug report that `from ROOT import *` is broken in Python 3 so I don't understand why it's not disabled as it will only confuse users: https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8931.

Modifiability,"`gInterpreter::ProcessLine` has an important run-time cost.; Instead of calling it everytime the jitting of an action is required, we now store all the strings that are to jit in TLoopManager and do a single call to `gInterpreter::ProcessLine` before running the event-loop. A couple of life-time issues had to be resolved for this to work properly: in order to let result proxies and action helpers share ownership of the result object, I introduced (simple) manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr (weird, I know). In order to deal with deferred jitting of an action that hangs from a node whose `TInterface` has already been destroyed (can happen due to the deferral of jitting) all `BuildAndBook` functions have been made independent of `TInterface`. In the long term it might be possible to refactor the jitting mechanism so that the `TAction` (and the `TTreeReaderValue/Array`s that it contains) is jitted but the action helpers are not, lifting the requirement of manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr. Although this should be possible in principle, I currently don't see how we could integrate it with the existing logic, so I decided for this much less invasive solution. Before/after runtimes for two extreme scenarios:. `test_inference.cxx` (which performs a lot of jitting).; compile time: ~8s -> ~9s; run time: ~40s -> ~7s. 50 jitted Histo1D calls in a loop (thanks to Attila for the use-case):; run time: ~35s -> <2s.

It is a private function, so to signature can simply be changed and the argument removed; - [x] The unused `_ownsParameters` member should be removed. However, that's not all! There are more issues with this class that have to be resolved in a followup PR:. - [x] Various memory leaks (search for `new ` in the file and you will find them, almost everything created on the heap is leaking.; - for example, [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/1608dfa0d8d630617d6b529ccb090a0bbab00bbc/roofit/roofit/src/RooLagrangianMorphFunc.cxx#L836) we even have some RooDataHists that leak; - [x] There is a static counter variable in the default constructor.

Chapter on schema evolution support needs to be added to the Users' Guide.; For example bases in the scenario:. ```cpp; class Position { /* point in 3D space */; public:; Position(float x, float y, float z);; // get Cartesian coordinates; float x();; float y();; float z();; // get spherical coordinates; float r();; float phi();; float theta();; // get pseudorapidity; float eta();; };. class Hit : public Position { /* localized detector signal */; public:; Hit(float energy, float x, float y, float z);; // get energy and transverse energy; float e();; float et();; };; ```. * Now, consider 3 stages of evolution for Position:. 1. Simplest implementation is to have Cartesian coordinates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct). Could you please provide a working example in which data are saved and fetched with different combinations of (1, 2, 3)x(a, b, c) (at least with 1a, 2b, 3c)?. * The next step is to consider collections of objects:. i) define. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit > m_hits;. };; ```. ii) Because the crazy developers of Hi",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14540:1102,evolve,evolves,1102,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14540,1,['evolve'],['evolves']

Modifiability,"ates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct). Could you please provide a working example in which data are saved and fetched with different combinations of (1, 2, 3)x(a, b, c) (at least with 1a, 2b, 3c)?. * The next step is to consider collections of objects:. i) define. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit > m_hits;. };; ```. ii) Because the crazy developers of Hit decided to make such class variable size, one needs to store a vector of pointers instead of objects:. ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; std::vector< Hit* > m_hits;. };; ```. iii) Disk space is very short! We cannot waste the single 32-bits word used by the STL vector... ```cpp; class Track { /* particle trajectory */. private:; unsigned int m_Nhits;; Hit* m_hits; //[m_Nhits]. };; ```. Please, provide some working example that shows how to write and read all these 3 evolutions of Track (you may use whatever version of Hits). . [Courtesy of Diego Casadei]. ### ROOT version.

Modifiability,"ation based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `...Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. ## Todo:. There are still a couple of things that require attention, which I hope the reviewers can help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_types.h`: maybe we could replace this with @guitargeek's new configuration structs.; 4. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test. Finally, one thing that in an ideal world I would have liked to do is add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, I'm rather short on time right now, and these things almost always tend to take longer than one expects, so I'm hesitant to build it now. The **advantage** would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization.

Modifiability,"been built for Python 3.10; ```. A check with `readelf` reveals the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` is the reason for this problem. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/root/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:2697,Config,Configure,2697,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,1,['Config'],['Configure']

Modifiability,"ce, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2. To make this all work, we also had to upgrade precision of the transformation functions to long double instead of double, otherwise round off errors would still persist and ruin any chances of exact bit-wise equality.; 2. In `mathcore`: Some additions to `IFunction` were made to allow Minuit2 to probe functions for their ability to generate gradients and second derivatives. Similar additions were made to function adapter classes in Minuit2.; 3. In RooFit:; 1. Most RooMinimizerFcn functionality was moved into an abstract base class RooAbsMinimizerFcn, which in turn forms the base class of the new RooMinimizerFcn, but also of the added RooGradMinimizerFcn (serial, but gradient external to Minuit2) and MinuitFcnGrad (with parallel MultiProcess back-end) classes.; 2. The RooRealMPFE based classes can make use of an added parameter `CPUAffinity`. In Unix systems (not macOS), this makes the MPFE based parallelization a lot faster by pinning processes to physical CPU cores.; 3. To accomodate the new minimization frameworks, RooMinimizer was changed quite a bit as well. It is still backwards compatible, but the new functionality can be accessed through a new `create` template factory function. This template function allows users to pass in their own calculation back-ends, e.g. for calculating on GPUs or in autograd enabled frameworks.

As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:3041,config,config,3041,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,3,['config'],['config']
Modifiability,"clad is a C++ plugin for clang and cling that implements automatic; differentiation of user-defined functions by employing the chain rule in; forward and reverse mode, coupled with source code transformation and AST; constant fold. In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a; set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function; specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer; program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary; arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.); and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain; rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can; be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at; most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original; program. AD is an alternative technique to symbolic and numerical differentiation.; These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads; to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of; converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical; differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization; process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with; calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase.; Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial; derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for; gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves; all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more software; dependencies. This patch allows ROOT to interoperate with clad. Namely, users can ask; the interpreter to produce a derivative or a gradient to a known function.

Modifiability,"declares its dependency on VDT in a very silly way that does not make any sense to me...). Even though it clearly ""publicly"" depends on those headers. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/vecops/inc/ROOT/RVec.hxx#L54. ### Expected behavior. When using the exported target `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`, I would expect to be able to use `RVec.hxx` just by linking my own target against `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`. Not having to care about the ""internal"" dependency of the ROOT code on VDT myself. To fix, the following should happen:; - VDT should be used in the ROOT CMake configuration through an imported target, not through `${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}` and `${VDT_LIBRARIES}`. (Since these make relocation very hard.); - Once `ROOTVecOps` depends on a library like `VDT::vdt`, `ROOTConfig.cmake.in` will need to include. ```cmake; find_dependency(VDT); ```. somewhere around here: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/cmake/scripts/ROOTConfig.cmake.in#L88-L99. In such a setup, as long as `builtin_vdt` is ""correctly"" installed alongside ROOT, the configuration should start becoming correct under all circumstances. ### To Reproduce. Don't really have a reproducer. But a CMake project like:. ```cmake; cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.10 ); project( VecOpsTest ). find_package( ROOT REQUIRED ). add_executable( VecOpsTest VecOpsText.cpp ); target_link_libraries( VecOpsTest PRIVATE ROOT::ROOTVecOps ); ```. , with a simple. ```c++; #include <ROOT/RVec.hxx>. int main() { return 0; }; ```. (as `VecOpsTest.cpp`) should be able to produce an error. As long as ROOT and VDT headers are not in the same location. Which is usually the case unfortunately... ### Setup. This is primarily an issue with ""LCG builds"" of ROOT. Where currently we have to manually take care of linking our code explicitly against VDT, even if we don't use those headers directly ourselves. ### Additional context.

The build starts ""pretty much"" at the left hand side of the timeline, and lasts until ""pretty much"" the right hand side of it. As you can see, the build starts out very well. Building LLVM scales perfectly to 64 threads. And I believe it would scale well to even beyond that. But once the LLVM build is done, many bottlenecks show up. First there is a big bottleneck with building `libCling` and `rootcling`, but after that the build of `libRIO` is also taking a surprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.).

However, currently, there is no safeguard to prevent new commits from introducing new errors, which is prone to happen, as not everyone is familiar with the doxygen syntax. To maintain in a sustainable way the 'clean status' of the reference guide and online documentation, it would be helpful to add an automation script that compiles the documentation only with the files modified in the Pull Request to be merged, in the same way that a bot checks now about clang-format, etc. Because Doxygen can be configured to have only one input file, this extra check will not involve much time as compared to building the whole documentation.

Modifiability,"e moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet. The reason for the switch is that the derivator scheme used in `RooGradMinimizerFcn` replicates that of Minuit2, so comparing to that makes more sense. Also, it just hasn't been tested at all with Minuit 1, I'm not even sure it will work with that version. Other than these `RooMinimizer` changes and the addition of `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new test was added called `testRooGradMinimizer`. It also uses a `test_lib.h` header that will also be used later on in tests of other new likelihood minimization implementations. **Do note that the test currently fails.** I originally had carefully made sure the results were bit-wise exactly the same as those from using classic `RooMinimizerF",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596:1495,refactor,refactor,1495,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"e. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros.

Modifiability,"eighted samples. It should be clarified both in the code documentation and in the user guide, if the implementation can handle weighted templates in the asymptotic limit, by applying the SPD approximation discussed by Bohm and Zech, 2014. This is possible (as we show in our paper https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), but only if the implementations handles this special case. Conway's paper does not discuss weighted templates and does not explain how to use the SPD approximation in this context. Long version:. The code documentation of RooBarlowBeestonLL on the master is incorrect. It is stated that this class implements the Barlow-Beeston likelihood computation, but it actually implements an approximation introduced by Conway in 2011. The approximation is only asymptotically equivalent to Barlow-Beeston, for small samples it is inferior. We recently published a paper about a new approximation to Barlow-Beeston (https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), which is fast to compute and can be used with weighted templates and weighted data. In this paper, we compare the performance of Barlow-Beeston and several approximations including ours. It is shown there, that Conway's approximation is inferior to the exact computation by Barlow-Beeston. I was pointed to this class by the LHCb collaboration. There is uncertainty in the community what this class actually computes and whether it is asymptotically correct for weighted templates. I kindly ask to correct and extend the documentation. **I think the best solution is to revert the implementation of BarlowBeestonLL to actually implement the original BarlowBeeston.** Then make a new class called ConwayLL which implements Conway's approximation. I am happy to provide another class which implements our method in ROOT. So far, the reference implementation is in the iminuit Python package. ### ROOT version.

Modifiability,"er/CMakeLists.txt` and runtime searches in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CIFactory.cpp`. Below I'm listing a number of things I noticed, and I think it would be worth it to clean up this business:. - [ ] Let's start with the obvious: `CLING_CXX_PATH` and `CLING_CXX_HEADERS` are declared as `option`s in `interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CMakeLists.txt`. This gives them a type of `BOOL` instead of `STRING` (or maybe `FILEPATH` for `CLING_CXX_PATH`?).; - [ ] If these variables are not set by the user, the build system starts to make some guesses. These choices are not `FORCE`d back into the `CACHE`, so it will be re-computed on every CMake invocation.; - [ ] The code for determining `CLING_CXX_PATH` has a large section dealing with `ccache` and `distcc`, which can only be taken if users set the environment variable `CXX=""ccache g++""`. Since CMake 3.4, it is recommended to instead use `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`, or ROOT's `ccache=ON`, so this may be obsolete?; - [ ] The header lookup is inconsistent between the build system and the `CIFactory`: The messages during configuration suggest that the order is; 1. Determined directories of C++ headers, or if not found; 2. Invocation of the compiler's full path, or as a fallback; 3. Invocation of the compiler's relative path. I think this matches the initial implementation, but it's not true anymore since commit afabc3b63885427251fd69b4aeda887bae35a289 switched to asking the compiler in the `PATH` first, to address a problem report from CMS.; - [ ] It also appears that the default guess from the build system is to *either* set the compiler's full path *or* its relative path. This is potentially problematic because changing the `PATH` could make the interpreter pick up a different compiler, even though it could still ask the existing full path. It's also inconsistent with respect to the previous point because a compiler in `PATH` takes precedence over the directories determined at build time, while a compiler out",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612:1241,config,configuration,1241,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11612,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"ery strict source compatibility requirements: ""we should only break source compatibility if the ROOT constructs were actively harmful in some way, the volume of affected ROOT code is relatively small, and we can provide source compatibility and migration"". As discussed with @pcanal, and with TExecutor introduced in ROOT 6.08, there's little possibilities any user has implemented a new derived class from TExecutor. If this happened, the user is most probably advanced enough to be able to change the implementation. In any case, the volume of affected ROOT code will be relatively small. . As suggested by @dpiparo, for the moment we will keep the new ```TExecutor``` in ```ROOT::Internals```, not exposing it to the user. The executor usage will look as following:. ```cpp ; ROOT::Internal::TExecutor pool(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial);; auto mapFunction = [](unsigned i){return 1u;};; auto reductionFunction = [](const std::vector<unsigned> &v) {; return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0u);; };. pool.MapReduce(ROOT::Fit::ExecutionPolicy::kSerial, mapFunction, ROOT::TSeq<unsigned>(20), reductionFunction);; ```. **TLDR;** This PR changes the behaviour of existing executors and introduces; new ones:. * TExecutor: changes its functionality to be a general Executor, while; TExecutorBaseImpl takes the role of the previous TExecutor. TExecutor; now acts as a general interface to the executors. The executor it will; resolve to is specified by a execution policy parameter in its; constructor. * TExecutorBaseImpl: Plays the previous role of TExecutor. * TSequentialExecutor: provides a sequential implementation of the; executor model, defined by TExecutorBaseImpl. This PR is not finished, but I'm opening it for discussion. Things left:; - [x] Change kSerial to kSequential. - [x] Move Execution Policies to ROOT::Internal. - [x] Adapt Fitting functions to use the new TExecutor instead of if statements.

I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros. Level 1 would enable the warning messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag WARNINGMSG is defined. Level 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero.

Modifiability,"first and; second derivatives of the scale factors are smooth. The `PiecewiseInterpolation` class is more general, because instead of; taking constant interpolation parameters, it takes other `RooAbsReals`.; That means it makes no sense for that class to cache the polynomial; coefficients that have to re recomputed anyway each time the input; changes. It uses an optimized formula to do the interpolation on the; fly. The `FlexibleInterpVar` however precomputes and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero.

Modifiability,"fixes #7584 . This PR shows a possible refactor of the logic that finally creates the ranges to send to the distributed resources. It works in the following steps:; 1. Split the big HeadNode class in differente head node types according to the original data source (e.g. EntriesHeadNode, TreeHeadNode, in the future also RNTupleHeadNode). Use a factory to get the correct head node type according to user provided arguments to the RDataFrame constructor; 2. Create a different Range type per each head node type. This makes the passing of information more modular, allowing sending only a couple of integers in the case of empty RDF , or adding info about friend trees in the case of a tree based RDF; 3.

Modifiability,"his:; ```; y; B; y; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx A xxxxxx; y; y; ```; where A and B are the minima along the x and y axis respectively. This approach has the advantage that the number of function evaluations scales like with k * n, where k is the number of dimensions and n the number of steps per dimension, while a full grid search scales like n ^ k. However, this approach will fail miserably when x and y are correlated, trying this on the Rosenbrock function for instance gives terrible results (basically no improvement with respect to the starting value). ### What to do?. The current behavior of MnScan is not what people usually consider a scan, which most people understand as a full grid search over the whole N-dimensional space. It seems that MnScan is not really used in ROOT, but I may be mistaken. If it is not really used, I would suggested to keep the name MnScan and change the implemenation to do a full hypercube scan. I am strongly convinced that MnScan should do a full grid search instead of what it currently does, because the current implementation is fairly pointless for most real-world functions which have correlations. If MnScan has a use case that I am not aware of, then I propose to add a new Minimizer, MnHyperScan (or similar name), which implements the full scan. ### Other issues with current MnScan. - One cannot configure the number of steps taken per dimension when MnScan is called through the minimizer interface (MnApplication). The maxcalls option should be used for this.; - A gradient and second derivatives are computed for the starting values, only to be discarded. This is wasteful.; - The scan returns EDM = 0, which is very misleading. It should either return inf or NaN, to indicate that the EDM is invalid. Ideally, a proper EDM should be calculated for the obtained minimum after the scan.; - MnScan always builds a vector of all the (parameter, function value) pairs obtained during the scan, but that vector is discarded after the run.

Modifiability,"is clear) were written to the most recently opened file, not to those with which they were initialized. In the link above, I found the way to solve this:. TFile.Write(). would save its objects. I find this very non-straightforward. I think that if a file is associated with TTree, it should be written to that file. On the line 891 of [TTree.cxx](https://root.cern/doc/master/TTree_8cxx_source.html) there is a fixme comment:. > // Insert ourself into the current directory.; // FIXME: This is very annoying behaviour, we should; // be able to choose to not do this like we; // can with a histogram. That comment was misleading for me, I thought that was not implemented and was looking for hackish ways not to do that. ### Optional: share how it could be improved; I see several ways how it could be improved:. 1) make Write use TTree's file if that was set in the constructor. This is natural and doesn't contradict inheritance from TObject, because a) not all ROOT objects belong to the global directory b) virtual functions can be reimplemented in daughter classes; this is fine when the general behaviour is the same.; 2) add to TTree:Write documentation the way to write to a given file instead of the current file (this might be easier to find and understand than in the vast docs of TTree).; 3) maybe create a method Write(file) of TTree with an argument TFile/(its parent). In the [program of work for 2020](https://indico.cern.ch/event/875784/contributions/3690258/attachments/1975740/3288395/ROOT-PoW2020-EP-SFT.pdf) on page 10 Axel Naumann proposes: ""Keep interfaces readable for current ROOT users. canv->cd(); hist->Draw(); becomes canv->Draw(hist)."" I think this is very much in line with this suggestion, and it's just a good design. ### Setup; 1. ROOT 6.22/06. ### Additional context; I found a question [TTree.Write() vs. TFile.Write()](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/ttree-write-vs-tfile-write/82) on the Forum, so it may be better to explain (or implement) it more explicitly in doc",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7308:2102,inherit,inheritance,2102,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7308,1,['inherit'],['inheritance']

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug; <!--; A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is.; -->; When passing a argument to a formula based RooFit function (e.g. `RooFormulaVar` or `RooGenericPdf`), RooFit will search for all occurrences of the object name in the formula and replace them with an ordinal parameter (needed for the underling `TFormula`). However, when the argument is a `RooConst` the name is just a string containing the value and this can break if there are numeric literals inside the formula.; For example; ```; RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.)); ```; becomes inside the `TFormula`; ```; x[0].7*x[0]; ```; because the name 2 of the `RooConst` matched the 2 of the numeric literal. This of course breaks during formula compilation. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; The variables do not replace numeric literals no matter the name. Possibly `RooConst`s should be matched only by index?. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->; ```; RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.)); ```. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->; HEAD of ROOT 6.26 from LCG dev4. ### Additional context; <!--; Add any other context about the problem here.; -->; `RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.7))` creates `x[0]*x[0]`, which is mostly fine but may break if servers are redirected",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11992:1234,variab,variables,1234,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11992,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"le analytical answer), but it turned out that it's not possible to set bounds for it. [RooUniform](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooUniform.html) creates a uniform distribution for the whole range of its variable (or many variables in the case of many dimensions). On the [forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/rooaddpdf-sum-of-uniform-distributions/18927/2) @lmoneta writes in 2015: ""You cannot really assign weights to a RooUniformPdf."" (but probably this has already changed, because I see that it is a subclass of RooAbsPdf, like RooGaussian). ### Describe the solution you'd like; Change the constructor to. RooUniform(const char *name, const char *title, RooAbsReal &x_low, RooAbsReal &x_up). One- and multidimensional uniform distributions should become separate (like [RooGaussian](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooGaussian.html) and [RooMultiVarGaussian](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooMultiVarGaussian.html) (note also a spurious line break in its docs)). Probably there is even no need for the multidimensional uniform distribution, since it's just a product of one-dimensional pdfs (if you don't model complicated support shapes). The uniform (rectangular) distribution is just one of pdfs (see Wikipedia, [Continuous uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)). It is a normal pdf, and its parameters are its lower and upper bounds. They should be set like other pdf parameters in RooFit. ### Describe alternatives you've considered; I think that there are no alternatives. No reason to model this with step functions or histograms. The uniform distribution is a simple and pretty basic probability distribution. ### Additional context; I [asked about this on the forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/uniform-rectangular-pdf-with-variable-range/44232), but now as I better understand RooFit and as I see no answers for RooUniform, I think this is the only solution.

The fact that all the code from all the RDatFrame objects is JITted at the same time is an optimization, but it has a fragility. In case an RDataFrame books some JITted operation but the computation graph is never triggered, it will leak memory of those objects that were created on the heap but never freed by the corresponding helper functions. Furthermore, those objects in turn are connected to their respective RDataFrame object, which meanwhile can already be gone out of scope. ### Reproducer. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <iostream>; #include <TFile.h>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <ROOT/RLogger.hxx>. auto verbosity = ROOT::Experimental::RLogScopedVerbosity(ROOT::Detail::RDF::RDFLogChannel(), ROOT::Experimental::ELogLevel::kDebug + 10);. int main(); {. {; std::cout << ""Begin scope\n"";; ROOT::RDataFrame rdf(1);; auto df1 = rdf.Define(""x"", ""42"");; std::cout << ""End scope\n"";; }; }; ```.

Modifiability,macOS has introduced feature named System Integrity Protection which prevents DYLD_* and LD_* environment variables to be propageted to a ROOT process.; We must disable the feature to use multiple versions of ROOT with AliBuild. There are two solution for this:. - Fix gSystem->Load() to allow dynamic loading using another environment variable; Pros: It just works (possibly) without out of tree modifications. Easy to relocate.; Cons: It's dirty. Unexpected load paths may be used even if they they have low priority. - Change all macros ever made so that they call gSystem->Load() with the full path or call AddDynamicPath in advance; Pros: It's neat. One can control load path precisely.; Cons: Too many macros to fix. We should fix the macros after relocation of libraries.

Modifiability,"mentation. . I am having to spend way too much time trying to figure out what basic stuff is. Eg. a TTree is apparently a list of ""independent columns"" but so far looks to me very much like it is the equivalent of a table used to back a higher level representation of table in which case the columns are not independent - they would be related (unless ""independent columns"" is being used to mean statistically independent variables). And I came across ""event"" in code comments which sounds very like ""event"" is a ""row"" of data which'd make sense from a Cern perspective but is ambiguous/meaningless/confusing to a newbie. ### share how it could be improved. A Glossary with ROOT term equivalents in other frames of reference. Eg. Event ~ row ~ tuple ~ observation (assuming I guessed correctly). TTRee ~ RDataFrame/TDataFrame ~ dataset ~ Table ~ 1 or 2 dimensional Array or Tensor ~ a grid of data with one row per event/observation/record.; TBranch ~ column of data in a grid or table of data; TLeaf ~ element ~ cell - a single observation of single variable. And where these are not correct list the differences between them to clarify what they actually are. Without a clear and precise understanding of what the terms mean you are never sure about what you are doing. ----------------------------------------------------------; Some (more) high level notes on how the framework works would be very useful at the start of the primer or comments in the code to explain ""magic"" when it happens - I was scratching my head as to how one particular object knew to use another when no relationship appeared in the code anywhere;; ```. // The canvas on which we'll draw the graph; auto mycanvas = new TCanvas();. // lots of code like... // Draw the graph !; graph.DrawClone(""APE"");. // but no mention of mycanvas again until... . mycanvas->Print(""graph_with_law.pdf"");; ```. which raises all sorts of questions ( as it is not obvious what is going on ).; ; -----------------------------------------------",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11967:1104,variab,variable,1104,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11967,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake:924 (target_link_libraries):; The link interface of target ""XRootD"" contains:. OpenSSL::SSL. but the target was not found.

Call Stack (most recent call first):; CMakeLists.txt:305 (include); ```; while on the same machine and in another empty directory doing just:; ```; cmake -Dbuiltin_xrootd=ON .; ```. The difference between the two case is that the `ssl` variable usually default to `ON` but in the minimal case it default to `OFF` and turning on `builtin_xrootd` does not turn `ssl` back on. The reason why this matters is that `find_package` defaults to declaring its results only inside the parent_scope. In practice we see `find_package` works properly in the top level `CMakeList.txt` and in one level of indirection (typically `cmake/modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake`) but a second level of direction (i.e. inside the `add_subdirectory(builtins/xrootd)` inside `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake`), it does not work.

Modifiability,"n't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize offsets, because during the gradient calculation the LikelihoodSerial objects on the workers are used to calculate the likelihoods there, so for them the offsets must be up to date.; * The LikelihoodJob contains a LikelihoodSerial member as well now. This allows the LikelihoodJob to trigger calculating the offsets on the master process before sending them to the workers.; * LikelihoodWrapper has some added private helper functions for managing offsets. - Other miscellaneous changes:; * LikelihoodWrapper::setApplyWeightSquared was implemented properly for RooSumL likelihoods as well, passing along the call to component RooUnbinnedLs. Note, however, that it is currently not reachable for users because there is no interface to pass this along from the RooMinimizer, which contains the MinuitFcnGrad, which contains the LikelihoodWrapper. A comment in MinuitFcnGrad.h refers to this, reminding future devs to also flip offsets_reset_ when (un)setting squared weights.; * LikelihoodWrapper now holds the likelihood_type. This cleans up some code duplication in LikelihoodSerial and LikelihoodJob, which previously used the type only in their ctors, and avoids dynamic_casts later, e.g. on when calculating offsets.; * A RooSubsidiaryL can now also be computed with LikelihoodSerial and LikelihoodJob; this case was still missing in their evaluation functions.; * The LikelihoodSerial, LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob ""ConstrainedAndOffset"" test cases used the wrong argument for the constrained parameter. These are now corrected from alpha_bkg_obs_A to become alpha_bkg_A.; * In LikelihoodJobTest, the added test case ""UnbinnedGaussian1DSelectedParameterValues"" shows where splitting over events can lead to bit-wise differences.

Modifiability,"nc` members were removed, since these are now managed by the `*MinimizerFcn`.; - This means also things like function name and title, but also optimization switches, were moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet. The reason for the switch is that the derivator scheme used in `RooGradMinimizerFcn` replicates that of Minuit2, so comparing to that makes more sense. Also, it just hasn't been tested at all with Minuit 1, I'm not even sure it will work with that version. Other than these `RooMinimizer` changes and the addition of `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new test was added called `testRooGradMinimizer`. It also uses a `test_lib.h` header that will also be used later on in tests of other new likelihood minimization implementation",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596:1348,extend,extended,1348,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596,1,['extend'],['extended']

It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files, how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data). Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree. Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1.

Modifiability,"not found; ```. This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```. This `LC_RPATH` variable is set for our own libraries, e.g. `libHtml.so`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libHtml.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib (offset 12); ```; But for some reason this information is lost after building `builtin_xrootd` (probably while installing the libraries from the prefix to the install directory). A way to solve this is by manually adding the `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` option to the `cmake` invokation of `builtin_xrootd` as is done in this PR. The result is:; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib (offset 12); ```; This solves the initial problem with the python tutorial that now can run without errors; ```; $time python build/tutorials/dataframe/df103_NanoAODHiggsAnalysis.py. real 0m20.308s; user 0m18.505s; sys 0m0.733s; ```.

Modifiability,"nt). *The nll is computed by roofit, with two methods that give the same result (probably they use the same internal function). *The nll is computed ""by hand"" :; -I could reproduce exactly the value of nll of roofit if I ""forget"" to multiply the pdf by the bin size *only in the sum part* of the likelihood formula. -If I compute it in what I think is ""correct"", I could not find the value obtain by roofit. Hypothesis of explanation : createNLL does not anticipate the possibility of binned pdf. More details : pdf : 3 slides; [Minimum_Problem_NLL.pdf](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/6383379/Minimum_Problem_NLL.pdf). A minimum reproducible example is given here :; /afs/cern.ch/work/e/escalier/public/ForOthers/ForRootExperts/ProblemNLL. (github prevents to attach a .C file : it would be useful to authorize it if we wish to keep persistent minimum examples for the future). Remark : the anomaly would not have consequence for the result of a fit. But if the bin size would be variable, maybe there would be (I don't know). Anyway, there is incompatibility of treatment of the bin size for the total of the pdf and the value of pdf in a given bin. ### Expected behavior; the expected value is given in the example : roofit does not find the mathematical correct value because it forgets to multiply by the bin size for the ""sum part"" (while it does not forget to multiply by the bin size for the ""total prediction"" part. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves. a) put : do_mistake_computation_find_official_roofit_value=1 for reproducing the result of roofit. b) put do_mistake_computation_find_official_roofit_value=0 for reproducing what I think is the correct value (different to the one of roofit). 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; root -b Minimum.C+. ### Setup; 1. ROOT version : 6.18.00; 2.

Ideally, if something is exposed as an option to users, like `-Dasserts=ON` is, and it's set to `OFF` on the command line, it should not be altered by the build system, as that is surprising behavior.

Modifiability,"ode is BSD-licensed. The pull-request includes a source tarball (allowing a ""builtin_lz4"" option in CMake analogous to ""builtin_lzma""). I am unable to test this on Windows currently. The LZ4 algorithm focuses on decompression speed while sacrificing compression ratio. Compression level < 4 uses the ""LZ4 compression"" algorithm while compression level >= 4 uses ""LZ4HC"" (HC = high compression) variant. LZ4HC is comparable to zlib in speeds, but has approximately 20% larger file size. To evaluate, I use the Event executable in the test/ directory. I extend this to allow the compression algorithm be specified via CLI. Example invocation:. time ./Event 4000 6 99 1 1000 4; time ./Event 4000 4 99 0 1000 4. Here, the CLI arguments are:; - 1: Number of events (4000); - 2: Compression ratio (6); - 3: Split level (99); - 4: 1 for write, 0 for read.; - 5: Number of tracks per event (1000).; - 6: Compression algorithm (1 = zlib, 2 = lzma, 4 = lz4. 3 is the deprecated zlib-like algorithm).

Modifiability,"offsets: one for each likelihood component. This makes a difference only for RooSumL fits, i.e. simultaneous PDF fits or fits with constraint or global observable terms. This brings the results of these fits closer to the old-style RooNLLVar fits, because those also use per-component offsets (per-RooNLLVar in a RooAddition to be exact).; * In LikelihoodJob::evaluate, the result_ KahanSum is no longer initialized to zero, but is initialized to the first value in the results_ array, both sum and carry term. This sometimes makes a difference: adding a term with a small but non-zero carry term to an existing sum with a zero sum and zero carry term can make the small non-zero carry term disappear.; * Due to these changes and the earlier KahanSum updates, we were able to tighten the tolerance of tests in testLikelihoodSerial, testLikelihoodJob and testLikelihoodGradientJob, with many tests now passing EXPECT_EQ.; * testLikelihoodGradientJob adds offsetting to the parameterized test matrices of the LikelihoodGradientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets. At construction time within a MinuitFcnGrad, they get passed the same single offset object so that it is always kept synced between the different likelihood calculators. If it isn't synced and the likelihood gets different offsets at different times, the minimizer understandably gets very confused. This was the case before this commit, which was, in fact, a bug.; * For LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob, the offsets are also synchronized to all workers via update_state. For this, we simply check before evaluation whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger. Note that while the LikelihoodGradientJob doesn't itself use the offset (it doesn't calculate the likelihood), it must still synchronize o",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202:1705,parameteriz,parameterized,1705,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterized']

In summary, given that ROOT issues an implicit `using namespace std;` and due to the way `SemaLookup` works, decls that shadow something in the `std` namespace cannot be referenced without using their fully-qualified name, i.e. `::xxx`.; See discussion in ROOT-5971 for the details. This pull-request improves the situation by emitting a warning for that case. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `Interpreter::m_InputFlags`, which provides additional information about the context in which parsing occurs. In particular, the `kInputFromFile` and `kIFFLineByLine` flags allow to tell whether a sequence of calls to `Interpreter::process()` is issued from `MetaProcessor::readInputFromFile()` for the contents of an external file.; - Update cling's DefinitionShadower to emit a warning if a new declaration shadows a name in the `std` namespace (that became available via the implicit `using namespace std`). This diagnostic is disabled for unnamed macros, as input is typically ingested in a single `process()` call, which makes all the variables local to the generated wrapper. . This requires to change the lookup redeclaration kind to `NotForRedeclaration`, which has a performance penalty, given that the lookup will follow using directives, etc. This is approximately one order of magnitude slower than `ForVisibleRedeclaration` (see table below). The overhead seems acceptable given that this kind of lookup already occurs when a declaration is referenced and that definition is rare w.r.t. use.; ```; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; | Redeclaration kind | Time (us) for 1000000 lookups |; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; | ForVisibleRedeclaration | 27617 |; | NotForRedeclaration | 717458 |; +-------------------------+-------------------------------+; ```. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally.

Modifiability,"place in the existing memory buffers). For example - primitives and lists of primitives are supported; anything needing references are not. Despite the fact many of ROOT's very useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:. * A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; * A TTreeReader-like interface, TTreeReaderFast. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize and apply user code, rather than two.; * The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by TDataFrame, provided we can make TDataFrame sufficiently fast.; * A Python-based numpy export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; * The numpy interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur.

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug; <!--; A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is.; -->. The provided reproducer's ""bad"" test fails when the reproducer is built against a ROOT with `runtime_cxxmodules=ON` but passes when `runtime_cxxmodules=OFF`. Verified with 6.24/06 and 6.25/02. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->. Tests ""good,"" and ""bad"" should both pass. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->. 1. Ensure you are using ROOT >= 6.24/00; 1. Ensure you are using CMake >= 3.22.0; 1. Execute the provided `runit` script to configure, build, and execute the tests. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->. 1. Problem verified on 6.24/06 and 6.25/02.; 2. SLF7.; 3. ROOT was compiled for UPS, configured using FNAL/art standard options. See attached ROOT build logs for details. ### Additional context; <!--; Add any other context about the problem here.; -->. The showstopper issue appears to be that when looking for information about `gallery::Event` (defined in an ""old-style"" dictionary rather than a C++ module), it mistakenly identifies the TMVA module as providing `Event` and never loads the dictionary containing the definition for `gallery::Event`. This issue does not occur if we look for the aliased `gallery::GalleryEvent` instead, nor if `runtime_cxxmodules=OFF`. In addition, when `runtime_cxxmodules=ON`—even for the ""good"" case—I get many messages of the form:; ```Console; Error in <TCling::Regis",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9583:1199,config,configure,1199,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9583,1,['config'],['configure']

Modifiability,"rrors, warnings, and debug info. Some of these only work when certain compile flags are set (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). I would like to unify these systems and use the MnPrint facilities consistently everywhere. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN_DEBUG_* macros.

I think (I did not tested it fully), by looking at the `TFileMerger` class it seems the `target` directory is not deleted after having called ; ```c++; target->SaveSelf(kTRUE);; ```; I guess the issue is coming from that . **This becomes a real issue as if you have a lot of histograms stored in different directories (which is the case of our analysis) then the hadding command is killed on lxplus.

When enabling coverage, a report is generated by default in the `coverage/` directory inside the build directory. The results can be viewed by opening the file `html/coverage_details.html`. This step can be disabled by passing `-DGCOVR=0` to `ctest`. It is recommended to use a debug build to generate the coverage analysis. The configuration can be specified directly on the command line via the `-C` option. For example, to run a coverage build in debug mode, with less verbose output, and showing test output when a test failure happens, one can run:; ```sh; ctest -V --output-on-failure -C Debug -DCOVERAGE=1 -S test.cmake; ```; Some environment variables can also influence the behavior of the script, like `CC`, `CXX`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, `CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, `CDASH`, `DESTDIR`, `BASE_REF`, `HEAD_REF`, and GitHub Actions environment variables. These are mostly self-explanatory and can be used to override the provided defaults. For example, to build with the clang compiler and use Ninja as CMake generator, one can run:; ```sh; env CC=clang CXX=clang++ CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja ctest -V -S test.cmake; ```; Finally, the script tries to load configuration files from the `.ci/` subdirectory in the source directory. The default configuration is in `.ci/config.cmake`. It is used if no specific configuration is found for the detected OS. For example, on Ubuntu, a file named `ubuntu.cmake` will be used if present instead of `config.cmake`. The script also tries to detect a version, so, for example, on Alma, one could use `almalinux8.cmake` which would have higher precedence than `almalinux.cmake`.

Modifiability,"s. ### Describe the bug; Using pyRoot, preparing a selection string to use in TTree.GetEntries(const string * selection), it seems that a string of the type: `_value1_ <= _variable_ <= _value2_""`. should be working but insteads it returns an error: `TTreeFormula bad expression ""=_value2_""`. when other operators work just fine (no error), e.g.:. - `_value1_ < _variable_ < _value2_""`; - `_value1_ <= _variable_ < _value2_""`; - etc. I have tried with and without parentheses around the conditions. The only working solution (for now) to write: `_value1_ <= _variable_ && _variable_ <= _value2_""`. but this sensibly slows the code. ### Expected behavior; Using `_value1_ <= _variable_ <= _value2_""` should not return an error when trying to limit a variable to a closed interval, in the same way it works when limiting a variable to an open interval. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. The code that can reproduce the issue is the following:; ```; import itertools; import numpy as np; import ROOT as rt; paramList = { 'Variable_1' : np.linspace(0,1,4),; 'Variable_2' : np.linspace(0,3,5) }. boundaries = list(itertools.product(*[itertools.combinations(val,2) for val in paramList.values()])); for val in boundaries:; string = 'dmID_signal == <whatever ID for final particle>'; for bounds, key in enumerate(paramList.keys()):; string += "" && ({} <= {} <= {})"".format(val[bounds][0], key, key, val[bounds][1]); signal = sigData.GetEntries(string); ```. 2. I cannot really join a .root file here, but it is just a matter of changing _Variable_1_ and _Variable_2_ of _paramList_ for 2 variables of a TTree. Also, I start the selection string with a selection of dmID but that can be removed, you just need to modify the string so that it doesn't start with _&&_. 3. To run the code, write it in a python file or jupyter notebook and run it using Python 3. ### Setup; 1. JupyROOT 6.22/08; 2. Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon; 3.

Modifiability,"ses on the other hand. The likelihood is the central unit on the statistics side. The `RooAbsL` class is implemented for four kinds of likelihoods: binned, unbinned, ""subsidiary"" (an optimization for numerical stability that gathers components like global observables) and ""sum"" (over multiple components of the other types). These classes provide ways to compute their components in parallelizable chunks that can be used by the calculator classes as they see fit. On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a set of likelihood builders. The calculator ""`...Wrapper`"" classes are abstract interfaces. These can be implemented for different kinds of algorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind. In an upcoming PR, we will introduce the fork-based multi-processing implementation based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `...Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. ## Todo:. There are still a couple of things that require attention, which I hope the reviewers can help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_types.h`: maybe we could replace this with @guitargeek's new configuration structs.; 4. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`...

Modifiability,"ssages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). For wrappers like iminuit, it is important to redirect the log to its own streams that can be readout and displayed in Python, for example in a Jupyter notebook session (std::cerr and std::cout always go to the terminal and are invisible in a Jupyter notebook).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:4151,config,configurable,4151,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['config'],['configurable']

The script can be generically called as; ```sh; ctest -VV -S test.cmake; ```; from the top directory of the repository. There are several options to customize the build, the main ones are:. | Option | Description |; |----------------------|-------------|; | -DCOVERAGE=1 | Enables test coverage analysis with gcov; | -DMEMCHECK=1 | Enables memory checking with valgrind; | -DSTATIC_ANALYSIS=1 | Enables static analysis with clang-tidy; | -DINSTALL=1 | Enables an extra step to call make install; | -DCDASH=1 | Enables submission to CDash (needs CTestConfig.cmake). When enabling coverage, a report is generated by default in the `coverage/` directory inside the build directory. The results can be viewed by opening the file `html/coverage_details.html`. This step can be disabled by passing `-DGCOVR=0` to `ctest`. It is recommended to use a debug build to generate the coverage analysis. The configuration can be specified directly on the command line via the `-C` option. For example, to run a coverage build in debug mode, with less verbose output, and showing test output when a test failure happens, one can run:; ```sh; ctest -V --output-on-failure -C Debug -DCOVERAGE=1 -S test.cmake; ```; Some environment variables can also influence the behavior of the script, like `CC`, `CXX`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, `CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, `CDASH`, `DESTDIR`, `BASE_REF`, `HEAD_REF`, and GitHub Actions environment variables. These are mostly self-explanatory and can be used to override the provided defaults. For example, to build with the clang compiler and use Ninja as CMake generator, one can run:; ```sh; env CC=clang CXX=clang++ CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja ctest -V -S test.cmake; ```; Finally, the script tries to load configuration files from the `.ci/` subdirectory in the source directory.

Modifiability,"t introduces a structure (`RDaosKey`) to represent a blob's location within DAOS containers (comprising object ID, distribution key and attribute key) and adds a new mapping between ntuple pages to DAOS. The new mapping ( `kOidPerCluster` ) allocates one object per cluster and determines the distribution key from the column ID - with each page addressable by its own attribute key - , thus perpetuating the adjacency of values in the same cluster and column in the distributed store. I.e., neighboring values that are likely to be fetched together are coalesced to the same physical device in DAOS. The original mapping remains available as `kOidPerPage`, where each page is uniquely allocated its own object. In future, other mappings may be easily added by modifying the templated function `GetPageDaosKey` with that use case. RW calls in `RPageStorageDaos` use the mapping set in `kDefaultDaosMapping`, which is `kOidPerCluster`. ## Changes or fixes:; - Introduces `RDaosKey` as an abstract representation of a blob's location in DAOS comprising object ID, distribution key and attribute key.; - Mapping strategies are listed in the enumerator `EDaosMapping`, currently with values `kOidPerPage`, `kOidPerCluster`. ; - The function `GetPageDaosKey` determines the correct `RDaosKey` from page metadata in accordance with the strategy given by the templated argument of type `EDaosMapping`.; - The variable `kDefaultDaosMapping`, set to `kOidPerCluster`, holds the mapping for `RPageStorageDaos` RW calls.; - RNTuple page metadata (anchor, header, footer) blobs are mapped to a single object with three attribute keys, while a dedicated object is allocated to hold the pagelists (one for each cluster group). ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally and on openlab cluster: passes unit tests, LHCb dataset on DAOS 2.0; - [x] updated the docs (if necessary).

Please take a look at our [blog post for more information](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/). This pull request enables code scanning by adding an auto-generated [`codeql.yml` workflow file for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository — take a look! We tested it before opening this pull request, so all should be working :heavy_check_mark:. In fact, you might already have seen some alerts appear on this pull request!. Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation. Questions? Check out the FAQ below!. ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing!

Modifiability,"the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:; - A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; - A `TTreeReader`-like interface, `TTreeReaderFast`. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize *and* apply user code, rather than two.; - The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by `TDataFrame`, provided we can make `TDataFrame` sufficiently fast.; - A Python-based `numpy` export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; - The `numpy` interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur. So indeed, lot's of experimental / internal interface work here - but we felt that (a) a sufficient amount depends on this and (b) we've demonstrated enough utility that it was time to start talking about merging.

Modifiability,"tic case already exists in TMath). As previously discussed in the ROOT forum https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/relativistic-breit-wigner-and-relativistic-voigt/48844 , the relativistic version has been added to mathmore rather than TMath, as it requires including a header file with an integrator which is CPU intensive. This has hence been added as it's own class in mathmore, with two functions:. static double evaluate(double x, double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);; static double dumpingFunction(double median, double sigma, double lg, double integrationRange=26.615717509251260);. The default integrationRange was chosen as the integral has been wrote in a form where it is multiplied by exp(-t^2), and this value of integrationRange results in going to the point where exp(-t^2) reaches the minimum value stored by a double. A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute. This is shown in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09304.pdf equation 9 which has been used here. I am unsure how referencing works with ROOT. [Note: the function used here is not actually identical to equation 9, as the paper linked uses a different normalization than ROOT does for the non relativistic voigt which is already implemented in TMath. I have renormalized this equation to be consistent with the non relativistic case already in ROOT). The two functions that have been defined are:. evaluate, simply gives the value of the relativisitic voigt at the point requested; dumpingFunction, this is a commonly used function which is defined as the value of the relativistic voigt at its peak, divided by the value of the relativistic breit wigner at the peak that is part of the relativistic voigt. This is useful as it quantifies how much the voigt is smeared by the gaus",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049:2290,variab,variables,2290,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11049,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"urrently when installed with `-Dgnuinstall=ON` ROOT ends up exporting relative paths from the `${CMAKE_INSTALL_CMAKEDIR}` to the relevant binary, include and library directories. This can be a problem, especially when these paths may be evaluated from a different system folder assumed by CMake (e.g. when `CMAKE_INTSTALL_CMAKEDIR` is not the same for ROOT and CMake) as well as in other cases, when relative paths are not appropriate. Thus, it is safer in the general case to have these relative paths resolved to absolute system paths immediately before being passed to a caller. This merge request tries to accomplish just that with complete transparency and zero side-effects.

Can Python 3 version be found checking symlinks of `/usr/bin/python`, and not its highest version available?; I also use Python 2, hope it won't break its search. ### To Reproduce. Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Install Python version newer than the system one.; 2. Build root.; 3. Import Python ROOT (it will fail). ### Setup. 1. ROOT version: ROOT Version: 6.29/01, From heads/master@v6-29-01-1273-g360c0c7c54.; 2. Operating system: Arch Linux, Built for linuxx8664gcc.; 3. Build myself from this repo. ### Additional context; I create software packages, that's why I use several Python versions (to provide better experience to users with different tools). It would not be very convenient to remove some python version in order to build ROOT. I have no idea where this search is being performed. Yesterday I left a comment on an old issue, but can't find it. On another system of mine it is also written that ""Python 3 not found"", and then it is built fine.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12744:2588,perform,performed,2588,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12744,1,['perform'],['performed']

Adding a `del f` at the end doesn't trigger this. . Attaching gdb, the failed assertion is: . ```; 1209	 if (type->tp_flags & Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT) {; 1210	 assert(type->tp_dictoffset);; 1211	 int err = _PyObject_VisitInstanceAttributes(self, visit, arg);; 1212	 if (err) {; 1213	 return err;; 1214	 }; ```. So it seems to likely have something to do with #12857. Oddly, it does not seem to affect my system ROOT version (packaged by Fedora) which is also ROOT 6.28.06 and presumably built with Python 3.11, suggesting that there may be something complicated going on (I was only building my own ROOT in hopes of reproducing @clark2668's problem). None of the patches Fedora applies seem to be relevant, but probably there are differences in compilation flags. .

Performance," `FieldDescriptors` is used elsewhere in the code (see improvements in API client code in 222a412). It also removes move-only semantics on `RFieldDescriptor` (my eventual intent is to remove move-only semantics on all `Descriptors`). `RFieldDescriptor` is made up of value-types only, so there are no resources to worry about. . For merging `NTuples`, we need to copy many descriptors (possibly with some small adjustments). ; With move-only semantics, we'd have to implement a `Clone` method for `RFieldDescriptor`. ; This is disadvantageous compared to relying on value semantics. `Clone`, while conceptually simple, is additional code to maintain.; * If we ever add fields to the class, Clone could be buggy (missing the added field); In contrast, the copy constructor will never miss any fields. ; * Move-only object lifetimes are non-trivial to reason about, we increase the risk of introducing UB by relying on a moved-from object, etc. . Regarding performance concerns (`RFieldDescriptor` has a vector member), I think C++ helps us here with Return Value Optimization and copy elision (simplified example here: https://godbolt.org/z/FwmKaD). . The high-level changes are: ; * define default values for a field descriptor; * remove move-only restriction on `RFieldDescriptor`; * implement a builder class for `RFieldDescriptor` to make construction (and using `RNTupleDescriptorBuilder`) more explicit. ; </details>. We introduce a new type, `RDanglingFieldDescriptor`, that supports the builder pattern for field descriptor values, e.g. ; ```c++; RFieldDescriptor fieldDesc = RDanglingFieldDescriptor(); .FieldId(1); .FieldName(""some_field""); .Structure(ENTupleStructure::kCollection); .UnwrapDescriptor(); ; ```. Dangling descriptors let us modify all field descriptor information except for relationship information (i.e. they have no idea about field parents or children). They are meant to be used for building new `RNTuples` through `RNTupleDescriptorBuilder` or during a merge operation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5934:1633,perform,performance,1633,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5934,2,"['Optimiz', 'perform']","['Optimization', 'performance']"

Performance," although I have not fully tested if this works. . ## Expected behavior; Array members of objects in TTrees are accessible via PyROOT as was the case before 6.22. . ## To Reproduce. I attached a MWE (really a minimal failing example), including a script to build/generate a tree/run the offending python scripts (faiing.sh): [mwe.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/5286101/mwe.tar.gz). The gist is that the event here is a simple class: ; ```. #ifndef _mwe_event_h; #define _mwe_event_h. #include ""TObject.h"" ; #include <array>. class MWEEvent ; {. public: ; MWEEvent() { iev =-1; bar=-1; foo[0] =-1; foo[1]=-1; } . // workaround for not being able to access foo directly ; double get_foo(int i) const { return foo[i]; } . int iev; ; double bar; ; double foo[2]; ; virtual ~MWEEvent() { ; } . ClassDef(MWEEvent,1);; }; ; ```. A tree of these objects can be read with PyROOT fine if only the scalar members are touched, or the getter is used:. ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.get_foo(0)); print (ev.get_foo(1)); ```. But if you try to access the array member directly (as used to work), it does not work:; ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.foo[0]); print (ev.foo[1]). ```. This results in . ```; python breaks.py ; 0; 0.9989327176093981 ; -0.43476438941434026 ; 0.7817962561955079 ; 0 ; 0.9989327176093981 ; *** Break *** segmentation violation; ; ; ; =========================================================== ; There was a crash. ; This is the entire stack trace of all threads: ; =========================================================== ; #0 0x00007",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6468:1391,Load,Load,1391,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6468,1,['Load'],['Load']

Performance," any supported C++ type, including `std::variant<Ts...>` and collections such as `std::vector<T>`. ## Changes or fixes:; - Allow for including the index of the first element in a column in the column description. This introduces the column flag `kFlagDeferredColumn` which specifies that the column has no on-disk data for elements preceding the given element index.; - `RPageSink::UpdateSchema()` now takes an additional argument (firstEntry) that specifies the first entry that stores an on-disk value for the fields in the changeset. The entry index is translated to column element index by `EntryToColumnElementIndex()`.; - `RPage::MakePageZero()`: this function returns a page that is comprised of `0x00` bytes only.; - Introduce locator type `kTypePageZero`. This locator type represents unmaterialized (i.e., in-memory only) zero pages for deferred columns.; - Add `RPageRange::ExtendToFitColumnRange()`: this function extends a RPageRange to fit the given RColumnRange, i.e. prepend as many synthetic `RPageInfo`s as needed to cover the entire range. `RPageInfo`s are constructed to contain as many elements given a page size limit in bytes; the locator for the referenced pages is `kPageZero`.; This function is used to make up `RPageRange`s for clusters that contain deferred columns.; - Add `RClusterDescriptorBuilder::AddDeferredColumnRanges()`, which makes up `RColumnRange` and `RPageRange`s that make sense for deferred columns that are otherwise missing in a cluster.; - RPageStorageFile: add ability to populate the zero page from `kTypePageZero` locators.; - RVariantField: allow reading values with dispatch `tag == 0`. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary); - [x] RPageStorageDaos: populate the zero page from `kTypePageZero` locators. (for a follow-up PR?); - [x] Possible optimization: `UnsealPage()` should be a no-op for zero pages; this is to be handled in PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12279.

Read the RNTuple (this will create a `cachedntuple.root` file); ```cpp; void read_ntuple(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(ntuplename, filename);. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; }; }; ```; ### 3.

Still missing all the logic for automatically switching to read the cached RNTuple rather than the original one; 2.

Performance," every computer; program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary; arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.); and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain; rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can; be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at; most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original; program. AD is an alternative technique to symbolic and numerical differentiation.; These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads; to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of; converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical; differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization; process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with; calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase.; Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial; derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for; gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves; all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more software; dependencies. This patch allows ROOT to interoperate with clad. Namely, users can ask; the interpreter to produce a derivative or a gradient to a known function. An illustrative example code for first order derivative:. root [0] #include ""Math/CladDerivator.h""; root [1] double my_pow2(double x) { return x*x; }; root [2] auto derivative_meta_obj = clad::differentiate(my_pow2, /*wrt 1-st argument*/0);; root [3] derivative_meta_obj.dump();; The code is: double my_pow2_darg0(double x) {; return (1. * x + x * 1.);; }; root [5] derivative_meta_obj.execute(1) // no iterations, at the cost of function call.; (double) 2.0000000.

Performance," executing rootcling (for example for G__Net.cxx) *before* `G__Rint.cxx` was created and thus before `lib/Rint.pcm` was properly created, a default `lib/Rint.pcm` is auto-generated and registered as one of the dependencies. Later the real `lib/Rint.pcm` is created is creation date is later than other `pcm` than depends-on/uses it’s creation time.

The reason for this is that we have QSysInfo both in the TQtClientWidget; and TGQt submodules and our current translation (which is supposed to; parse all header in the module) sees them both in one transaction. As we also don't recognize that this decl is from a module, the code; fires the assert even though duplictes are expected with modules. The reason why we don't recognize it as a declaration form an ASTFile; which disables the assert is that FromASTFile for the decls is; not set. This is because they haven't been loaded by the ASTFileReader; but are directly parsed as submodules in our special case where we; directly parse a module content from rootcling to generate it. We just workaround in this patch by checking that if the decl is from; the currently generated module, we are pretending it's as if it was; loaded from an AST file.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1236:2259,load,loaded,2259,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1236,2,['load'],['loaded']

Performance," special column `rdfentry_`, despite the name, does not correspond to the global TChain entry number _in MT runs_ (see also [the relevant docs](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html#helper-cols)). This is surprising for users (hence the big warning in the docs linked above) and makes it unnecessarily difficult to e.g. attach a numpy array as an additional column (because it's hard to index into it correctly without stable global row numbers). We could instead make `rdfentry_` always match the ""real"" (global) entry number in the dataset -- if only each MT task knew the offset of the current tree w.r.t. all other trees in the chain. ### Proposed solution . - have TTreeProcessorMT tell each MT task which tree it is processing w.r.t. to the global chain (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`, ...); - have each task calculate its tree's offset by going over a list of tree entry numbers, filling missing values as needed (the list of entry numbers would be implemented as an array of fixed size `nTrees` with atomic elements. This plus the fact that threads only need to write into the atomic elements if they see the value has not been calculated yet should minimize thread contention) . ### Other solution considered. - we could always build a global TChain, for every task, and always use global entry numbers everywhere. However this would require that TTreeProcessorMT reads out the number of entries in each tree before the tasks even start, because it first needs to come up with entry ranges for each task. My intuition is that this would bring a larger performance impact than the proposed solution: we know from DistRDF that the (redundant) opening O(1k) remote files at startup is a significant cost.; - we could do nothing: `rdfentry_` would be unstable and it could not be relied upon to e.g. index into manually added ""friend columns"" or to fill TEntryLists (like [this user would have liked to do](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/accessing-entry-information-using-rdataframe/52378))",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12190:1583,perform,performance,1583,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12190,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance," to store a category index; and a (possibly truncated) state name. This prevented fast batch access,; and increased the overhead for data storage and data loading. From now on, categories are represented as integers.; Every state can be denoted by index or name, but instead of storing; *both packed into an object* in each row of the dataset, only the index is stored, and the; mapping from index to state name is stored in the category instance. Since all the category classes were happily using the RooCatType, several; parts had to be touched to convert everything to using integers. This feature; has been cooking since March, and the interface for category classes was; discussed in the PPP, but nevertheless, have a double look at the above-mentioned; headers. In more detail:; - Replace RooCatType by an integer.; - Replace names saved in each row of dataset with RooCatType by a map in; RooAbsCategory that maps state names to numbers. This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Provide legacy iterator for iterating through states instances of; RooCatType, which will be created on the fly.; - Make RooVectorDataStore store integers instead of RooCatType instances.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore.; - Outline functions that polluted the header of RooVectorDataStore.

Performance,"# Goal. This PR implements `Im2Col` in CUDA in (what I consider) an optimal way in terms of performance. I achieve that by assigning one thread per output element. This means that threads do not share their write address and therefore no synchronization is required. They do share read address which is of course thread safe. I complement the new functionality with a complete testing suite to assert correctness. # Extra tasks. The tests within the `CNN` module suffer from extensive code duplication as the `Reference` and `CPU` versions do exactly the same thing (the CUDA one's would just worsen the issue). Instead I refactored the `Im2Col` one's using templated arguments: As a result the tests are now defined only once and called independently from each architecture using templates. This approach is also followed in the `DNN` module. If time allows, I plan to refactor all tests within the `CNN` module in a similar manner.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2118:92,perform,performance,92,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2118,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"# Problem Outline:; Precondition. On the **training (classification)** stage user adds array of variables to the `TMVA::DataLoader` object with a new method introduced in ROOT 6.20:; ```; TMVA::DataLoader *loader = new TMVA::DataLoader(...); loader->AddVariablesArray(""vars"", nBins);; ```. On the next stage - **classification application** user creates `TMVA::Reader` object and adds an array of variables to it:; ```; TMVA::Reader* reader = new TMVA::Reader(...);; std::vector<float> fValues(nBins);; reader->DataInfo().AddVariablesArray(""vars"", nBins, """", """", 0, 0, 'F', kFALSE, &fValues[0]);; ```. Pointer to the first element of the `&fValues[0]` passed to the `TMVA::DataSetInfo::AddVariablesArray(..., void *external)` function. Inside `AddVariablesArray()` pointer is **not incremented** in the loop where variables are defined. This provides faulty `reader->EvaluateMVA` output. # This Pull Request:; Modifies `TMVA::DataSetInfo::AddVariablesArray(..., void *external)` function. Depending on the variable type `char varType`, `void * external` pointer is incremented in the loop. This provides correct TMVA evaluation. ## Changes or fixes:; Please refer to the commit details. ## Checklist:. - [ ] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

Performance,"# This Pull request:. Adds the version 1 binary format specification and upgrades the implementation from version 0 to version 1. This is a backwards incompatible change. As of version 1, RNTuple is supposed to stay backwards compatible. The new binary format is a precondition for, among other things, the following required features; - Support for incremental loading of meta-data for very large files (>100G); - Sharded clusters, needed for backfilling; - Forward-compatibility; - Meta-data support. Compared to the v0 format, the header is ~40% smaller and the footer ~100% smaller (after zstd compression). This PR sets the pre-release tag 1 in the binary format, so files written in this version trigger a warning on reading. The pre-release tag might increase in follow-up PRs. Once stable, the pre-release tag will be set to 0.

Performance,"# This Pull request:; Many years ago, when I originially wrote the CholeskyDecompGenDim class, I argued that the class does not need copy constructor or assignment operator implementations because nobody would ever want to copy a decomposition. Well, it turns out that in today's world, one wants to be able to move (and potentially also copy) CholeskyDecompGenDim, so you can put it into an std::optional, for example, so you can return a std::nullopt if the decomposition state is not okay, and a decomposition otherwise. The code as it was up to this MR does not behave correctly if a CholeskyDecompGenDim is copied, moved or assigned. In the old code, if you copy or move a CholeskyDecompGenDim, you're likely to read garbage from the decomposition because of a potential for use-after-free, and/or get a double free on destruction of the object that goes out of scope later. ## Changes or fixes:; This patch fixes this shortcoming by using a std::unique_ptr<F[]> to hold the allocated memory. As a result, we can use defaulted destructor, move assignment operators and constructors, and default constructors, and just need to implement a specialized copy constructor and assignment operator. This change should be transparent to existing code, and enable new use cases, without sacrificing performance. (Note: CholeskyDecomp itself does not need to be fixed because the size of the matrix is known at compile time, and storage is statically allocated.). ## Checklist:. - tested changes locally: yes; - updated the docs (in-line documentation comments have been updated, but no changes are visible to callers in existing code that did not trigger the bug that this MR fixes)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14399:1295,perform,performance,1295,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14399,1,['perform'],['performance']

This PR introduces a major refactoring of the `RooAbs(Opt)TestStatistic`-`RooNLLVar` inheritance tree into:. 1. statistics-based classes on the one hand;; 2. calculation/evaluation/optimization based classes on the other hand. The likelihood is the central unit on the statistics side. The `RooAbsL` class is implemented for four kinds of likelihoods: binned, unbinned, ""subsidiary"" (an optimization for numerical stability that gathers components like global observables) and ""sum"" (over multiple components of the other types). These classes provide ways to compute their components in parallelizable chunks that can be used by the calculator classes as they see fit. On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a set of likelihood builders. The calculator ""`...Wrapper`"" classes are abstract interfaces. These can be implemented for different kinds of algorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind. In an upcoming PR, we will introduce the fork-based multi-processing implementation based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `...Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. ## Todo:. There are still a couple of things that require attention, which I hope the reviewers can help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_type",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700:194,optimiz,optimization,194,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700,3,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"## Description. There are several known compatibility problems of PyMVA and SOFIE with common Python modules that need to be fixed:. ### 1. Collisions of `openblas` because of SOFIE vs. NumPy; SOFIE can load an `openblas` version that is different from the one built in to NumPy, which can cause crashes for example on AlmaLinux 9 (the [TMVA_SOFIE_RSofieReader.C](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/CMakeLists.txt#L302) tutorial test is deactivated for this reason). ### 2. TensorFlow 2.16 compatibility for Python 3.12 support; PyMVA doesn't work with TensorFlow>=2.16 because of the change from Keras 2 to Keras 3 in TensorFlow (that the motivation for this version check in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/requirements.txt)). TensorFlow 2.16 support is important, because it's the first version that supports Python 3.12. ### 3. Collisions of `openblas` because of `tmva-cpu` vs NumPy; The TMVA CPU backend (activated with `tmva-cpu` has the same problem as stated in **1.**, because it also uses openblas. That's the reason why `tmva-cpu` is deactivated on `alma9`. ### 4. Collisions of `std::regexp` because of cppyy vs {torch, xgboost}; Collisions of `std::regexp` that comes with cppyy with the `std::regexp` in XGBoost or PyTorch. This is more of a [cppyy issue](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/issues/227) (or an issue of the other modules), but mostly affects PyMVA tutorials, because that's where ROOT is imported together with machine learning libraries. When this is fixed, 872886b and 1bf3d5a can be reverted.

Performance,"## Explain what you would like to see improved. I know that this is a **very** first world problem, but it has been bugging me since a while. The build of ROOT using its CMake setup is not scaling well to many core systems at all. :frowning:. This is a snapshot of how ROOT 6.20/08 used my system's resources during its build:. ![root-6 20 08-build](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30694331/94133565-1d97ec80-fe61-11ea-927d-94b8926cd41b.png). The build starts ""pretty much"" at the left hand side of the timeline, and lasts until ""pretty much"" the right hand side of it. As you can see, the build starts out very well. Building LLVM scales perfectly to 64 threads. And I believe it would scale well to even beyond that. But once the LLVM build is done, many bottlenecks show up. First there is a big bottleneck with building `libCling` and `rootcling`, but after that the build of `libRIO` is also taking a surprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries woul",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432:767,bottleneck,bottlenecks,767,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432,2,['bottleneck'],"['bottleneck', 'bottlenecks']"
Performance,"## Overview. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's `libGeom` and other third-party code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will require parsing. CxxModules diminish that benefit as providing a finer grained control over the information deserialization. We see no observable benefits in generating RDICT files next to our pcm files. . ## Performance results. We have run several times all tests in `roottest/io` and `roottest/meta/MakeProject` folders and compared the results with and without generating RDICT (namely with ROOT master with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` with and without this PR). They are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_swct0USyX1DMp0tJOPdZzvmvIOTXOS9s7n08wCb2I/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5LbPmhGBfhimirA0GH87nyEKcrGUfCX80H7-fOrjAU/edit?usp=sharing). ### Methodology. We have a forwarding `root.exe` which essentially calls `/usr/bin/time -v root.exe $@`. We have processed and stored this information in csv files. We have run in:; * (no)dict1-cold -- Tests are run immediately after restarting the physical test machine.; * (no)dict1a-cold -- Tests are run immediately after restarting the physical test machine. Second time.; * (no)dict2 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict1-cold;; * (no)dict3 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict2;; * (no)dict4 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict3;; * (no)dict5 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict4. The values of each column in (no)dict* are the sum of each value produced after running each test under roottest/io. The average values are computed in the columns under `dict` and `nodict`. The difference is shown in `diff`. There are two known test failures wrt to modules whose values are ignored.

Here is a simple reproducer:. ```; $ python -c ""import ROOT; ROOT.gInterpreter.LoadText('struct foo{};'); print(hasattr(ROOT.foo(), '__getitem__'));""; ```. In version `v6.28.12` this returns `false` whereas in `master` it returns `true`. This seems to be coming from `cppyy`:. ```python; import cppyy. cppyy.cppdef(""""""; struct foo {};; """"""). bar = cppyy.gbl.foo(); print(f""cppyy version {cppyy.__version__}""); print(f""Does foo have __getitem__()? {hasattr(bar, '__getitem__')}""); This gives:; ```. This returns:. ```; cppyy version 1.6.2; Does foo have __getitem__()? False; ```. vs. ```; cppyy version 3.1.2; Does foo have __getitem__()? True; ```.

By doing a strace, we figured out that this derives from root not being able to find `module.modulemap` which is present in `/opt/o2/include`, yet it is not considered. We are able to workaround the issue by simply copying module.modulemap in the current directory, which is apparently in the search path, however that is clearly not a viable solution in a deployed environment. What mechanism is used by default to lookup `module.modulemap`? We would be fine if we could work it around via some environment variable or systemrc tweak. ### Reproducer.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Describe the bug. When doing a simple `TFile::Open()`, ROOT initialises the interpreter on the first `TEnv::GetValue` needed by the aforementioned method. This makes it load all the pcms which it can find, regardless of weather they are needed to read the file or not (in our case we only have branches with basic types, e.g. floats or ints or vector of thereof). ; This has the net result of adding 70MB of RSS for no particular reason to any process which uses ROOT. You can find more details in the attached instruments screenshot.; Moreover, single stepping with the debugger and printing out the LoadModule argument, it seems that the pcms for Sofie, Proof and 3D graphics are particularly honours, all of which we do not need and we do not link. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10544/c1ee3a82-a5cc-4f64-a131-ea4fce1453c3). ### What is the expected behaviour?. The best would be for ROOT to be smart enough to lazily load the pcms when they are actually needed, not upfront. A second best option would be to be able to start the interpreter in a clean slate state and load by hand only the pcms which are needed to read a file. ### How to reproduce?. On macOS using Instruments one can do:; ; ```bash; xcrun xctrace record --output root.trace --time-limit 30s --template Allocations --launch -- /Users/ktf/src/sw/osx_arm64/ROOT/alice-v6-28-04-local2/bin/root.exe -q -b http://alimonitor.cern.ch/train-workdir/testdata/LFN/alice/data/2015/LHC15o/000246392/pass2/PWGZZ/Run3_Conversion/320_20220701-0813/AOD/019/AO2D.root; open root.trace; ```. and get the report in question.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Autoloading via the TCling::AutoLoad generally works very well, always exhibiting the same behaviour. However, sometimes it fails, for example when a symbol is in a library linked to a pcm which is not yet loaded. This is due to the fact that ROOT ultimately figures out which libraries to load based on the pcm linked to a certain class (scope to precisely use the Clang nomenclature). This happens because TCling::AutoLoad temporarily suppresses parsing: the lookup done by cling for a certain scope is doomed to fail if the pcm where the scope is defined is not loaded already. ### Reproducer. `root -b -q -l -e ""gInterpreter->AutoLoad(\""RooGaussian\"")""` ; returns 0 (unhappiness) ; ```; root [0] gInterpreter->AutoLoad(""RooGaussian""); (int) 1; ```; as the snippet shows, returns 1 (happiness).

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Class `TProcessEventTimer` is async timer and used inside `TTreePlayer::Process()` method to enable events processing during `TTree::Draw()`. Main problem - all data handling in the `THttpServer` performed inside `THttpTimer` handler - including `TTree::Draw()` invoked from `RBrowser`. So to say one cannot initiate async timer inside sync timer handler. There is simple solution. In `TUnixSystem::DispatchTimers(Bool_t mode)` one should change line 2947:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L2947; ```; fInsideNotify = !mode; ; ```. Means handling of ""normal"" sync timers is not dangerous and do not block functionality to reset async timer inside ; `TUnixSystem::ResetTimer` which implemented as:. ```; void TUnixSystem::ResetTimer(TTimer *ti); {; if (!fInsideNotify && ti && ti->IsAsync()); UnixSetitimer(NextTimeOut(kFALSE));; }; ```. Another solution - let process `THttpServer` events differently - not in the `THttpTimer` handler. ; But this means extension of `TSystem::DispatchOneEvent` method. Like adding generic event handlers called every time `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` is called. . ### Reproducer.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Consider the following tree loading structure:; ```; TChain c2 ---> TTree ---(friend)---> TChain c1 ---> TTree; ```; When iterating over `c2`, branches coming from `c1` stop updating after the first file boundary is reached in `c1`. They start updating again once a file boundary is reached in `c2`. I think this is distinct from #16804 because in this case the issues lie in `TChain::LoadTree`, while for #16804 `TChain::LoadTree` is the sole culprit. As in #16804, the root cause of the issue is that the following code is not invoked often enough:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1407-L1434; I will call the operation above an ""address refresh"". TChain has code triggering an address refresh when needed for friends of the current tree:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1384-L1393. Unfortunately this doesn't work for two reasons:; 1. The code cannot possibly be reached unless `c2` itself has friends because of the following condition:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1370; In our case `c2` doesn't have friends, but the `fTree` does. This is easy to fix (or work around).; 2. Even if `fFriends` is made non-null, `fetree->IsUpdated()` always returns `false` because `TTree::LoadTree` resets it:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/18b4f317b389fa7931d7eb8e00525f4dca44be0f/tree/tree/src/TTree.cxx#L6512; Fixing this is much more annoying. For [my application](https://gitlab.cern.ch/Proto/Darwin/-/merge_requests/44), I ended up subscribing to the `Notify` signal and calling `TFriendElement::MarkUpdated` again. This is only a partial solution because when `c2` loads a new file, it doesn't reset friend elements that were marked updated, which would happen somewhere along this l",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16805:103,load,loading,103,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16805,3,"['Load', 'load']","['LoadTree', 'loading']"

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Increasing the number of nodes in an RDataFrame computation graph can introduce serious overheads both in terms of performance and memory usage. In extreme (but very realistic) cases, this leads to OOM crashes. . A flamegraph (attached) can highlight that the main culprit is the allocation/deallocation of very large STL containers (std::map, std::vector), which happens in the machinery of the `RColumnRegister` class. This class has a copy-on-write policy, introduced by https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10899 and further explained at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11297 . ![many_defines_original](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/15638895/298b9fb4-b18c-4fb8-a103-8a7fccf225a7). For large graphs (O(10K) nodes), we start seeing multiple GBs of memory used just to make the `Define` calls, and a large portion of the total runtime being spent in the destruction of the RDataFrame itself (i.e. at the end of the application the user is stuck at the terminal). The copy-on-write policy is there for a reason. This way, any new branch of the computation graph can share the information about the columns defined (available) for that branch, without being contaminated by information coming from other branches of the graph (this is the cause of the CI errors in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14490 for example). We need to rethink about a way to keep the same functionality that does not incur in the performance/memory usage penalties. ### Reproducer. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>. #include <string>; #include <iostream>. int main(); {.

This can be seen saving the canvas to both . png .root formats, then load the .root and save it again as a .png, and compare the two pngs created. . Tagging CMS CAT conveners @lenzip @anigamova and DPROC subconveners @oglez @ttedeschi . ### Reproducer. Define a save.C macro:; ```C++; {; TRandom3 r;; TH1F h = TH1F(""test"",""Test"",100,-1.0,1.0);; for (int i=0;i<=1000;++i) {; h.Fill(r.Rndm());; }.

If `h.SetFillColor(TColor::GetColor(""#F5BB54""));` is uncommented and `h.SetFillColor(kRed)` is commented, `c.png` and `loaded_c.png` differ (the latter lacks the color), whereas if `h.SetFillColor(TColor::GetColor(""#F5BB54""))` is commented and `h.SetFillColor(kRed)` is uncommented, `c.png` and `loaded_c.png` are the same (both properly showing the red fill color). ### ROOT version. 6.32.04. ### Installation method.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. The problem occurs when performing a fit of multiple added pdfs to a distribution sampled from the pdfs itself. ; The expected behaviour can be seen in the cpu backend, where the correct parameter values are obtained (2.5, 7.5, 12.5 for the mus and 1 for each sigma). The cuda backend, however, doesn't find the correct terms for the last mu and sigma. With more added pdfs this is seen as well that the first few parameters get fitted somewhat to the data while the other parameters end up with seemingly random values (sometimes just their start values as if it is never attempted to fit them). The problem only occurs with sufficiently large numbers of events (e.g. 1e6). The results from both backends are visualized in the following plot:; ![myPlot](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/138122408/c3022fea-d074-443f-a623-d06132aeeaaf).

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. When a `TChain` is added as a friend to a `TTree` , branches coming from the `TChain` are no longer updated after switching to the second file in the chain. ### Reproducer. The [attached macro](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17592119/bugDemo.txt) reproduces the issue. Save it `bugDemo.C` and run it. The correct behavior is to always print `true`, but we get some `false`. The code first constructs two trees with an `index` branch. The index is the entry number, going from 0 to 10 in the first file and 10 to 20 in the second one. Then, a longer tree is constructed with 20 empty entries. The two files containing the entry number as merged into a chain and attached as a friend to the empty tree. Iterating over the long tree yields the correct value of `index` until the 10th entry, than a constant 9 (the last value in the first file). Correct behavior is 0 to 20. This can be obtained by wrapping the long tree in a `TChain`. The underlying issue is that `TTree::LoadTree` lacks the following code present in `TChain::LoadTree`:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1407-L1434. ### ROOT version.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. When input files to `RDataFrame` are remote files, force caching of remote files does not work and the remote files will be downloaded every time. . ### Reproducer. ```; import os; import ROOT. user = os.environ['USER']; outdir = f""/eos/user/{user[0]}/{user}""; filename = os.path.join(outdir, ""test.root""); # create dummy root file; ROOT.RDataFrame(100).Define(""x"", ""1"").Snapshot(""test"", filename).

This is because internally RDataFrame will create a TChain using [`ROOT.Internal.TreeUtils.MakeChainForMT(treename)`](https://root.cern/doc/master/RLoopManager_8cxx_source.html#l01169), which creates a `TChain` object with the mode `ROOT.TChain.kWithoutGlobalRegistration`. This in turn forces the TFile open option to be [""READ_WITHOUT_GLOBALREGISTRATION""](https://root.cern/doc/master/TChain_8cxx_source.html#l00505). This causes the TFile to be opened without caching since it only checks the [fgCacheFileForce](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTFile.html#a04d17cde8f18d500653077fc7d7dc3ac) flag when option is [""READ""](https://root.cern/doc/master/TFile_8cxx_source.html#l04182). ### ROOT version. 6.30/04 (LCG105a). ### Installation method.

Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. hi -. For some time now, ATLAS has had issues with dictionary operations; sometimes failing with clang assertions. When this happens, it is; of course only in the debug build; in the optimized build,; everything seems to work fine. The problem; is related to the ordering in which dictionaries are loaded --- we can; usually make the crashes go away by forcing a particular dictionary; loading order. This appears to be related to the traits-like class that we use to specify; the inheritance relations for our DataVector class. Schematically, it looks; like this:. ```; struct NoBase {};. template <class T>; struct DataVectorBase; {; typedef NoBase Base;; };. // Specialized derived version.; template <class T, class BASE = typename DataVectorBase<T>::Base>; class DataVector : public BASE {...};. // Base class version.; template <class T>; class DataVector<T, NoBase> {...};; ```. where user classes then specialize the DataVectorBase class; (in practice, done via a macro). I've now finally bit the bullet and reduced one example of this such that; it does not depend on ATLAS software. The test case is attached. If github still isn't allowing be to attach; archives, i've also put a copy on lxplus at ~ssnyder/public/fwddict-crash.tar. The set up is against a nightly debug build of 6.28-patches:. ```; $ . ./setup; $ echo $ROOTSYS; /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/nightlies/dev4/Sat/ROOT/v6-28-00-patches/x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg; $ ./build.sh ; $ python -i test.py; python: /build/jenkins/workspace/lcg_nightly_pipeline/build/projects/ROOT-v6-28-00-patches/src/ROOT/v6-28-00-patches/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Sema/SemaLookup.cpp:2165: bool clang::Sema::LookupQualifiedName(clang::LookupResult&, clang::DeclContext*, bool): Assertion `(!isa<TagDecl>(LookupCtx) || LookupCtx->isDependentContext() || cast<TagDecl>(LookupCtx)->isCompleteDefinition() || cast<TagDecl>(LookupCtx)->isBeingDefined()) && ""Declaratio",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14186:258,optimiz,optimized,258,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14186,3,"['load', 'optimiz']","['loaded', 'loading', 'optimized']"
Performance,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. hi -. Recently, we had an ATLAS bug report (https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ATR-28411); in which a job that loaded many dictionaries was starting to fail with; errors like. ```; cling JIT session error: Cannot allocate memory; ```. Although the job in question was not small, it was also not close to hitting; any limit on the process virtual size, which made this error confusing.; It turned out that what was happening was that the job was hitting; the limit on the number of VMAs, which on lxplus is just about 64k. A simple script which demonstrates the issue is given below.; When i run this on lxplus, it fails after about 21600 iterations, at which; point we have. ```; 21600 vmsize 1.2G nvma 65469; ```. So the total vmsize still (relatively...) quite small, but the number; of VMAs has bumped up against the system limit. Looking at a small part of the memory map:. ```; 7fb2d892f000-7fb2d8930000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8930000-7fb2d8931000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8931000-7fb2d8932000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8932000-7fb2d8933000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8933000-7fb2d8934000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8934000-7fb2d8935000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0 ; 7fb2d8935000-7fb2d8936000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 ; ```. So each time the jitter runs, it is producing a section of executable; memory, a section of read-only memory, and a section of read-write memory.; This would also be a performance issue. The jitter should somehow be more intelligent about grouping together; regions of the same protection. This may however be in tension; with other requirements, such as this comment from IncrementalJit.cpp:. ```; // A memory manager for Cling that reserves memory for code and data sections; // to keep them contiguous for the emission of one module. This is required; // for working exception handling support since one .eh_frame section will; // refer to many separate .text sections.

I need help to understand an issue which we have when running on Linux on ARM when reading a file which was serialised on x86.

ROOT version : LCG 103, hence ROOT 6.28.00-a8528; 2. Linux, centos7; 3. cvmfs. ### Additional context; The same is working under LCG 102. Also it seems to be related to using a complicated stack where python calls C++ which calls python which calls C++ again, with ROOT dictionary at pretty much all levels. Moreover, no LHCb code is used in the example, only Gaudi, but of course LHCb dictionaries are still loaded and a key point to the failure.; [material.zip](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/11397560/material.zip)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12758:1505,load,loaded,1505,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12758,1,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"### Explain what you would like to see improved and how. I checked various compiler optimizations like Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) on many projects - all the results are available at https://github.com/zamazan4ik/awesome-pgo . Since such optimizations help with optimizing CPU-intensive apps, I think it can be an interesting idea to optimize the Root project with PGO since the project cares a lot about performance. I can suggest the following ideas:. * Perform PGO benchmarks with some typical for the project workloads. If it shows improvements - add a note to the documentation about possible improvements in Root's performance with PGO. E.g. for Cling I already proposed evaluating PGO: https://github.com/root-project/cling/issues/508; * Perform testing Post-Link Optimization techniques (like [LLVM BOLT](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/README.md)) would be interesting too (Clang and Rustc already use BOLT as an addition to PGO). However, I recommend starting with the usual PGO since it's a much more stable technology with fewer limitations. ### ROOT version. Latest. ### Installation method. Any. ### Operating system.

The RDataFrame JIT logic makes use of a series of controlled memory leaks between different functions to ensure lifetime of objects that are needed by the JIT until that actually happens. This is an optimization but has certain fragilities, that were already analysed in a recent [bug report](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15399). The same topic surfaced in the past (see [this issue moved from JIRA](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15076)). And the fact we rely on leaking objects is subtly error-prone (see a recent [PR](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15477)).

More can be read here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows . Essentially we need a `actions/cache/restore@v3`.

The idea is to cache the builds of ROOT up to cling and make a hash that will invalidate the cache only if something in cling is touched. In that case the system will regenerate the caches. We need to figure out if the 10GB storage is enough per project or we can store these things locally. For the Clad project it has been working flawlessly for ~1 year now. . ### ROOT version.

Performance,"### Explain what you would like to see improved and how. i am looking at speeding up some code that uses TMatrixDSym widely (for large matrices whose size is not known at compile time). One primary bottleneck is code used to set or get elements in the matrix like. ```; TMatrixDSym d(100);; for ( int i=0; i< 100; i++) d(i,i)=i;; ```. which is limited by the virtual function calls needed for the checks. . https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/matrix/inc/TMatrixT.h#L255. In the case I was looking at, the code to fill the matrix was slower than the code to invert it due to this... The only workaround I find is to use GetMatrixArray() to get access to the underlying array and then hope that the internals don't change (while already ignoring fRowLwb and fColLwb being potentially non-zero. Using [] is kinda 2x worse as there are two layers of these sanity checks instead of just one. I see this workaround is already in widespread use in math/matrix classes.. Is there a better approach currently possible? If not, would it be possible to provide the equivalent of ; ```; d.GetMatrixArray()[i*100+i] = i;; ```; via some more readable/safer interface (useful at least for both TMatrixT and TVectorT)?. ### ROOT version. any recent. ### Installation method. build from source. ### Operating system. linux. ### Additional context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15285:198,bottleneck,bottleneck,198,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15285,1,['bottleneck'],['bottleneck']

Performance,"### Explain what you would like to see improved. In CMSSW we want to have dictionaries defined explicitly for all classes that are part of I/O. Occasionally some things slip through causing (sometimes?) ROOT to try to auto parse the header of the corresponding class. Many times the auto parsing works (but is not desirable), in some cases it fails with an unhelpful error message (in most cases so far this has been in conjunction with CUDA, by rootcling being unable to write to the `cuda.pcm` that is in cvmfs). With auto parsing disabled, we'd be able to emit an error message pointing to the class whose dictionary is missing. I gave a try on `TInterpreter::SetClassAutoparsing(false)` in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41344, and while in specific cases I got the desired behavior (of CMSSW framework emitting a descriptive error message for a missing dictionary instead of ROOT trying to auto-parse the corresponding header), the fact that the `SetClassAutoparsing()` is a global setting makes it difficult to disable the auto parsing in a useful way in the concurrent setup of CMSSW. There are a few cases (like open ROOT file, set up a string cut parser that uses ROOT reflection underneath) where the auto-parsing needs to be enabled, and these activities may be running concurrently to activities where I'd like to have the auto-parsing disabled. ### Share how it could be improved. Make the auto parsing setting more fine grained, e.g. explicitly in the relevant API calls or as a `thread_local`. Being able to query the value of the setting could be useful as well. ### How to reproduce?.

Reading [Delphes](https://github.com/delphes/delphes) trees (which use TClonesArray) with RDF is a bit complicated (see below) due to the need to cast elements to their concrete type, or convert the TClonesArray to a type-aware container (for reference: first brought up in https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/reading-tclonesarray-in-jitted-rdf/45784, thanks to @eguiraud for explaining why my naive code did not work). ### Optional: share how it could be improved.

Performance,"### Feature description. Currently, ROOT loads fonts via the `Root.TTFontPath`. This makes a lot of sense from a ROOT maintainer perspective (simply ship all used fonts), but is a roadblock for a distribution maintainer (embedded files are usually not wished if not otherwise possible). Thus, it would be nice if ROOT would _additionally_ support [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/), which is the default way to find fonts on Linux. In particular, the font interface should first look into `Root.TTFontPath` and then fallback to fontconfig. This means that the font-finding interface needs two parameters: the font file name and a fontconfig name as fallback. The current font interface is a bit all over the place. There is at least `graf2d/graf/src/TTF.cxx`, `graf3d/gl/src/TGLFontManager.cxx` and `graf3d/gl/src/TGLText.cxx` that handle font names, probably more. Fedora uses [this patch](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/root/blob/rawhide/f/root-fontconfig.patch) from @ellert to get rid of the non-free MS fonts (see also https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8357), which is a good start but the patch is not really feasible upstream due to Windows/OSX support. /cc @Axel-Naumann @dpiparo. ### Alternatives considered. _No response_. ### Additional context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16229:41,load,loads,41,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16229,1,['load'],['loads']

Performance,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.; Not a problem but a usage of XRootD feature that is not used by TFile::Open. ### Describe the solution you'd like; It would be useful that .meta4 files in `TFile::Open(""whatever_name.meta4"")`; to be passed for processing to TNetXNGFile (XRootD). ### Describe alternatives you've considered; There are no alternatives, TFile::Open (TNetXNGFile::Open) does not know to pass; to XrdCl the meta file for processing. ### Additional context; XRootD (XrdCl) know to use a meta file (`.meta4`) which is a virtual redirector. This allows not only fallback through a list a replicas to the same file but (at least for xrdcp) concurrent access (with `-y | --sources <n> `). There would be 2 problems to be solved:; 1. Add a signature to TNetXNGFile to allow to process a call like `TNetXNGFile::Open(""whatever_name.meta4"")`; 2. Tell TFile to redirect an access to a `.meta4` file to TNetXNGFile. For reference, just in case the file type is identified by content (but from what i seen in TFile::GetType this is not the case) a meta4 file is an xml with the signature like:; ```; <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>; <metalink xmlns=""urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:metalink"">. ... </metalink>; ```. I tried something on my own but i got entangled on my lack of knowledge of TFile mechanics, so i though to ask expert help here, maybe the solution is fast and simple (in expert eyes).; Adding here @simonmichal in case there are questions on XrdCl feature.; Thanks a lot!",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11653:683,concurren,concurrent,683,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11653,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

When using pyROOT (might not necessarily be due to using pyROOT) with '-h' or '--help' in sys.argv, if a ROOT method is called, a root CLI help message will be wrongly printed out. In a lot of cases when designing a python package that uses ROOT with CLI support, this bug will make the CLI print out the root help instead of the intended help message from the python package. ### To reproduce the issue (e.g. using python interpreter):; ```; import sys; sys.argv.append('-h'); import ROOT; ROOT.Double(); ```; This will print out the following message:.

Performance,"(https://github.com/root-project/root/files/8451196/files.zip). The problem seems to be at the level of TGenCollectionProxy: multiple threads end up sharing the same TGenCollectionProxy objects, which is not thread safe (e.g. because of https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/bce5777b8f479212babb7a8af5485d9a6bbd251e/io/io/src/TEmulatedCollectionProxy.cxx#L84-L85). In principle, however, as we use different TChains/TTreeReaders in each thread, they should also access different TGenCollectionProxy instances. Example backtraces at the point of crash (this is one of several failure modes, but it's the one where the problem is clear -- both threads, at frame 0, are accessing the same TGenCollectionProxy instance):. ```; >>> thread apply all bt 10.

Performance,"**For reviewers**:; The most important commit is the first, and specifically the files; `RooAbsCategory.h, RooCategory.h`; The former is the base class of all categories, the latter the user-facing implementation. Here's what happened:; RooFit categories were using the class RooCatType (: public TObject); instead of an integer to represent category states.; This class contained an integer and a char[256] to store a category index; and a (possibly truncated) state name. This prevented fast batch access,; and increased the overhead for data storage and data loading. From now on, categories are represented as integers.; Every state can be denoted by index or name, but instead of storing; *both packed into an object* in each row of the dataset, only the index is stored, and the; mapping from index to state name is stored in the category instance. Since all the category classes were happily using the RooCatType, several; parts had to be touched to convert everything to using integers. This feature; has been cooking since March, and the interface for category classes was; discussed in the PPP, but nevertheless, have a double look at the above-mentioned; headers. In more detail:; - Replace RooCatType by an integer.; - Replace names saved in each row of dataset with RooCatType by a map in; RooAbsCategory that maps state names to numbers. This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Provide legacy iterator for iterating through states instances of; RooCatType, which will be created on the fly.; - Make RooVectorDataStore store integers instead of RooCatType instances.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore.; - Outline functions that polluted the header of RooVectorDataStore. Updates for category interfaces:; - Provide new interfaces for categories to work without RooCatType.; - Add bracket operator and constructor arguments to define multiple; category states at on",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5502:562,load,loading,562,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5502,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"**Need**:. The need for a new evaluation metric for testing the convergence of the optimizer is essential. The already existing metric was maximumRelativeError() between two matrices which takes the maximum of all the relative errors between its individual elements. But the relative error between these elements depends on the element values. i.e. Relative error between a and b = abs(a-b)/(abs(a)+abs(b)). Let use consider 2 cases,. case a) If two values are a = 0.0001 , b = 0.0002, relative error = 0.3333; case b) If two values are a = 10.0001 b = 10.0002 relative error = 4.99992e-6 . Since the unit tests for optimizer is written in a way so that a sample 3 layer DNN will learn this function Y = K * X. So, If X = I ( Identity matrix ), then Y = K * I = K. This should be equivalent to the output of the trained DNN when I is feed as Input. Let Y' be the output of the trained DNN. So I need to compare the matrices K and Y' for approximate equality with a certain threshold. So If I use maximumRelativeError for comparing the approximate equality for two matrices, then even though the difference is small for two cases, the relative error is significantly different. So there is a need for a new evaluation metric.; ; **Goal**:. The goal of this PR is to implement new evaluation metric meanAbsoluteError() between two matrices which takes the mean of all the absolute errors of individual elements. Absolute error between a and b = abs(a-b). So both the cases described above will have the same absolute error. So I propose this would be a good choice of metric for comparing two matrices for approximate equality as needed for testing optimizers.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2376:83,optimiz,optimizer,83,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2376,3,['optimiz'],"['optimizer', 'optimizers']"
Performance,"**This migration is a great first issue for an enthusiastic open source contributor who wants to get started contributing to ROOT with a well-defined task!**. **This issue has already been addressed partially by many PRs, the only remaining iterator-creating function to look out for and replace is **`RooLinkedList::MakeIterator()`**!**. ## Introduction. RooFit needs to be migrated to use range-based loops to iterate over RooArgLists, RooArgSets, and RooLinkedLists. The [deprecated iterator-creating functions](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooAbsCollection.h#L178) `RooAbsCollection::createIterator()`, `RooAbsCollection::iterator()`, and `RooAbsCollection::fwdIterator()` have some overhead both is code verbosity and performance. For the RooLinkedList, the relevant function calls to replace are `RooLinkedList::MakeIterator()`, `RooLinkedList::iterator()`, and `RooLinkedList::fwdIterator()`. To do the migration, one could remove the deprecated functions from the code and try to recompile ROOT. From the compiler errors, one can see where a migration away from the legacy iterators is needed. Alternatively, one could mark the legacy functions as `[[deprecated]]` and get compiler warnings. If the iteration involved a type casting of each item, one can also use the `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` functions in RooFit to make the code more compact (introduced in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769). It is not expected that the full migration is done in one pull request, as these legacy iterations appear everywhere in RooFit. One can proceed with occasional PRs, migrating only one or a few RooFit classes at the time. ## Migration examples. Here are some examples on how the migration to range-based loops can look like. 1. Basic example:; ```C++; // with legacy iterator; TIterator* iter = comps->createIterator() ;; while((arg=(RooAbsArg*)iter->Next())) { ; // do something with arg; }; ```. ```C++; // with range-based",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8777:765,perform,performance,765,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8777,1,['perform'],['performance']

This assumes that `fSeekSort` is sorted and stable. Neither assumption is safe in a multi-threaded program with prefetching enabled. This can lead to corruption of the `fSeekSort` array when prefetching calls the `sort()` method while `GetUnzipBuffer()` is searching for a block. The call paths to the `sort()` method go through `TTreeCacheUnzip::ReadBufferExt()`, which locks `fIOMutex`. To work with prefetching enabled, `TTreeCacheUnzip::UnzipBuffer()` needs to lock `fIOMutex` in the sections where it needs `fSeekSort` to be stable, and reacquire the block location after any sections where the mutex isn't held. This looks to be non-trivial. ### Expected behavior. `TTreeCacheUnzip` should work with prefetching without crashing. ### To Reproduce.

This tessellated object is defined via vertex1 vertex2 vertex3, but does not add the ""type"" (absolute/relative) attribute if its in absolute coordinates (not 100% percent sure about this).; Loading this *.gdml file which contains a tessellated object results in a problem since the `AddTriangularFacet(bool relative)`; is not called due to the missing ""type"" statement in the if-else statement from TGDMLParse::Tessellated(4247) resulting in invalid boxed (dX/dY/dZ < 0):. ```; Error in <TGeoVolume::SortNodes>: Bounding box not valid; Error in <TGeoVolume::Voxelize>: Bounding box not valid; Error in <TGeoVolume::FindOverlaps>: Bounding box not valid; ```. and a following crash:. ```; ===========================================================; There was a crash.; This is the entire stack trace of all threads:; ===========================================================; #0 0x00007fb46acdc46c in waitpid () from /lib64/libc.so.6; #1 0x00007fb46ac59f62 in do_system () from /lib64/libc.so.6; #2 0x00007fb46f5e9524 in TUnixSystem::StackTrace() () from /nfs/mnemosyne/sys/cc7/sw/root/x86-64/6.22.02/system/root/lib/libCore.so; #3 0x00007fb46f5eb1ba in TUnixSystem::DispatchSignals(ESignals) () from /nfs/mnemosyne/sys/cc7/sw/root/x86-64/6.22.02/system/root/lib/libCore.so; #4 <signal handler called>; #5 0x00007fb46db2607d in TViewer3DPad::AddObject(TBuffer3D const&, bool*) () from /nfs/mnemosyne/sys/cc7/sw/root/x86-64/6.22.02/system/root/lib/libGpad.so; #6 0x00007fb451224035 in TGeoPainter::PaintShape(TGeoShape const&, char const*) const () from /nfs/mnemosyne/sys/cc7/sw/root/x86-64/6.22.02/system/root/lib/libGeomPainter.so; #7 0x00007fb4512261ad in TGeoPainter::PaintVolume(TGeoVolume*, char const*, TGeoMatrix*) () from /nf",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6868:455,Load,Loading,455,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6868,1,['Load'],['Loading']

This issue report follows my post in the ROOT forums https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/gdml-multiple-files-error-with-define/48581. Please refer to the forum post for additional details. In summary, when using the GDML modules feature as described on the manual (or so I think), the `<define/>` section of the child file is not being accessed correctly when the volume is a tessellated solid. This does not happen with a simple volume such as a box. On top of that I have managed to load the problematic GDML into Geant4 without problems, so that lead me to believe it is a ROOT bug. ### Expected behavior. Geometry should load without throwing an exception. ### To Reproduce. I load the GDML the following way:. ```; TGeoManager::Import(""mother.gdml"");; ```. `mother.gdml`:; ```; <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>; <gdml xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""https://service-spi.web.cern.ch/service-spi/app/releases/GDML/schema/gdml.xsd"">; <define />; <solids>; <box name=""world_solid"" x=""100"" y=""100"" z=""100"" />; </solids>; <structure>; <volume name=""world"">; <physvol>; <file name=""child.gdml"" />; </physvol>; <materialref ref=""world_material"" />; <solidref ref=""world_solid"" />; </volume>; </structure>; <setup name=""Default"" version=""1.0"">; <world ref=""world"" />; </setup>; </gdml>; ```. `child.gdml`:; ```; <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>; <gdml xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""; xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""https://service-spi.web.cern.ch/service-spi/app/releases/GDML/schema/gdml.xsd"">; <define>; <position name=""cube_v0"" unit=""mm"" ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9744:861,load,load,861,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9744,1,['load'],['load']

In the [attached reproducer](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/8609137/reproducer.tar.gz), `OtherClass` contains a `std::pair<int, MyClass>`; for both custom classes a dictionary is created. Manually loading the dictionary in the Root shell seems to lead to an incomplete type state for `MyClass`, such that some assertions fail. The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`. It thus seems that the presence of the `std::pair` somehow interferes with loading the dictionary for the contained class. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; The presence of `std:::pair` should not interfere with the dictionary of its contained classes. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

The problem is that even though all user-created objects die when functions `Integral()` and `Plot()` finish, the integral value is different if `Plot()` is invoked before the second call to `Integral()`. Both removing the call to `Plot()` or using the same value of `delta` in `Integral()` and `Plot()` make the test pass. Looks like `ws.pdf(""signal"")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects. ### Expected behavior; The integral value should not depend on the `Plot()` step - be equal before and after the `Plot()`. ### To Reproduce; Unpack the attached archive and run `root -b -l -q test.C` in the unpacked directory. ### Setup; The test passes for ROOT versions up to 6.22.00, fails in 6.22.06 and later (I didn't check between). It doesn't depend on the operating system nor machine.

Todo: ; - [x] Handle non-mappable case in `PopulatePage`; - [x] Investigate multi-threaded case. For multithreading, the current implementation just uses the existing `UnsealPage` mechanism and is unaffected by these changes -- deleted pages are returned to the cache which deallocates them properly. . I tried adding an internal mutex to `RPageCache` and bumping the number of cached pages to 128 on the benchmark machine but the runtime was about the same as the existing cache-less implementation. Further cache size increases did not show improvements, but as expected only having 32 cached pages for 128 threads was much slower. ```; ./lhcb -m (64-cores, 10 cold runs, 95% confidence interval); no cache: 776188us +- 9918us; cache (128): 780214us +- 11888us; %diff: -0.5%; cache (32): 1369689us +- 33365us; %diff: -76.46%; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8634:1582,multi-thread,multi-threaded,1582,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8634,9,"['cache', 'multi-thread']","['cache', 'cache-less', 'cached', 'multi-threaded']"

Performance,"-DINSTALL=1 | Enables an extra step to call make install; | -DCDASH=1 | Enables submission to CDash (needs CTestConfig.cmake). When enabling coverage, a report is generated by default in the `coverage/` directory inside the build directory. The results can be viewed by opening the file `html/coverage_details.html`. This step can be disabled by passing `-DGCOVR=0` to `ctest`. It is recommended to use a debug build to generate the coverage analysis. The configuration can be specified directly on the command line via the `-C` option. For example, to run a coverage build in debug mode, with less verbose output, and showing test output when a test failure happens, one can run:; ```sh; ctest -V --output-on-failure -C Debug -DCOVERAGE=1 -S test.cmake; ```; Some environment variables can also influence the behavior of the script, like `CC`, `CXX`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, `CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, `CDASH`, `DESTDIR`, `BASE_REF`, `HEAD_REF`, and GitHub Actions environment variables. These are mostly self-explanatory and can be used to override the provided defaults. For example, to build with the clang compiler and use Ninja as CMake generator, one can run:; ```sh; env CC=clang CXX=clang++ CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja ctest -V -S test.cmake; ```; Finally, the script tries to load configuration files from the `.ci/` subdirectory in the source directory. The default configuration is in `.ci/config.cmake`. It is used if no specific configuration is found for the detected OS. For example, on Ubuntu, a file named `ubuntu.cmake` will be used if present instead of `config.cmake`. The script also tries to detect a version, so, for example, on Alma, one could use `almalinux8.cmake` which would have higher precedence than `almalinux.cmake`. The default `config.cmake` tries to enable as many options as possible without failing if the dependencies are not installed. Sample `ubuntu.cmake` and `macos.cmake` are added in this commit.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14999:1943,load,load,1943,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14999,1,['load'],['load']

How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->. The following repository provides a Dockerfile to reproduce the issue in a container https://gitlab.cern.ch/eguiraud/arch_aclic_bug . ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->. ROOT master (but 6.22 also has issues) and arch linux.

Performance,"/github.com/root-project/root/issues?q=is%3Aissue); * AND [Jira](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/issues/?jql=project %3D ROOT); for existing reports of your issue. If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug. This issue report follows my post in the ROOT forums https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/gdml-multiple-files-error-with-define/48581. Please refer to the forum post for additional details. In summary, when using the GDML modules feature as described on the manual (or so I think), the `<define/>` section of the child file is not being accessed correctly when the volume is a tessellated solid. This does not happen with a simple volume such as a box. On top of that I have managed to load the problematic GDML into Geant4 without problems, so that lead me to believe it is a ROOT bug. ### Expected behavior. Geometry should load without throwing an exception. ### To Reproduce.

Adjust `OutputTransformer.py` to work with python3, probably other scripts should be improved as well; 5. Adjust `NetworkDesigner.js` to use d3 v6, load d3 from external source. Still to do: ; 1.

Performance,"1. Process active pad `TExec` when pad click/mouse move event is produced. JSROOT client deliver such events only when execs are configured. Good example is `hist/DynamicSlice.C` tutorial; 2. Process `TExec` from histogram list of functions. Here execs processed when client confirms drawing and returns applied ranges. Working example is `hist/htproj.C` tutorial; 3. Analyze modification of sub-pads, only data for modified pads send to the client. Improve performance when canvas with many sub-pads, but only few of them are modified. Good example is `hist/tprofile2polyRealistic.C` tutorial, which currently working very slow. ; 4. Optimize server/client communication. If canvas marked modified without real change of data, no extra message will be send to client. Also allows break self-triggered Modify/Update loops with `TExec` ; 5.

Free uncompressed page after compression, https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16753; 3. Delay buffer allocation in `RPageSinkBuf`. For the non-IMT case, the memory overhead is reduced to around the zipped cluster size. With parallel compression using IMT, all uncompressed pages need to be buffered first. The actual memory overhead is a function of how quickly these are consumed in the background (the slower, the later they are freed after compression) on the one hand and on the other hand how many tasks are running concurrently (each of them needs a temporary compression buffer).

It is specific to ppc64le on RHEL+EPEL 8. ### Expected behaviour. Root should behave the same on RHEL+EPEL 8 ppc64le and RHEL+EPEL 8 x86_64. ### To Reproduce. Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Build root 6.28.00 for RHEL+EPEL 8 on ppc64le using the default compiler -- g++ (GCC) 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-16); 2. Run tests. ### Setup; 1. ROOT version 6.28.00; 2. Operating system RHEL+EPEL 8 ppc64le; 3. Built from source. ### Additional context.

From my side (and that of the NL eScience Center), the project has ended and time has run out to make any further major contributions to it, except, of course finishing this PR and providing help to get it working and to possibly hand over further development :). Here are some notes for possible future work:; - RooFitZMQ includes an extension of ZeroMQ itself: a ppoll function. This function should ideally be contributed to ZeroMQ, but I have had no time for this. The motivation behind ppoll is given in this [blog post](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/combining-zeromq-posix-signals-b754f6f29cd6).; - At the last moment, I decided to reimplement part of the Queue functionality. The task distribution and parameter updating functionalities are now done directly using appropriate ZeroMQ sockets instead of indirectly through the Queue. The old-style Queue functionality, however, has not been cleaned up yet. Doing so will clean up the ""plumbing"" of the MultiProcess functions quite a bit.; - Benchmarking and optimization still has to be done for this version as well. The scaling results of the proof of concept (see references above) should be reproducible with this reimplementation, but this possibly still needs some tuning.; - After the most recent merging in of master, the RooGradMinimizer tests no longer pass, because the numbers are no longer floating point exactly the same. We have not looked into why, but one possible source is the reworked Kahan summation class. This was applied in RooMinimizerFcn, but not yet in our external-gradient classes.; - The proof-of-concept version classes are also still present in the source tree (`roofitcore/MultiProcess`), but have only been partially maintained since we started with the final version.

Upstream Clang has supported this scenario (with a suppressible warning) since Clang 10.0.0 shipped on 2020-03-24. Example on Compiler Explorer: https://godbolt.org/z/a75ooK6cz. The comment in `CIFactory.cpp` indicates that this was a known issue (although I was unable to find anything filed in GitHub or Jira) - is ROOT planning to upgrade its Clang/LLVM dependency, which would resolve this?. ### To Reproduce; Build ROOT with the latest MSVC STL from https://github.com/microsoft/STL, or wait for VS 2022 17.4 Preview 1 to ship (we can't provide an ETA yet, but it'll be some time). ### Setup; 1. ROOT version: `master`; 2. Operating system: Windows 11; 3. How you obtained ROOT: Built it ourselves (or tried to). ### Additional context; Supporting `explicit(bool)` will also improve build throughput, as `std::pair`, `std::tuple`, and `std::optional`'s constructor sets were nearly twice the size with the `_HAS_CONDITIONAL_EXPLICIT=0` workaround.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10875:2889,throughput,throughput,2889,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10875,1,['throughput'],['throughput']

Performance,"8510). The inital check for the compiler was. enable_language(Fortran OPTIONAL). This does not set the the CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER variable (or sets it to; NOTFOUND) if a Fortran compiler is not found, but still marks the; Fortran language as being enabled for the current project. This broke; the settings for BLAS/LAPACK. The second attempt (bb40ede3941d0b4f2db4e23d5f9c32b221eb5fac) was to use. check_language(Fortran); if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER); enable_language(Fortran); endif(). This does not find the Fortran compiler corresponding to the used C++; compiler. Cmake has some mechanism that if the C++ compiler is a GNU; compiler, it would also prefer GNU Fortran compilers. However, as the; check_language test is running in a separate process it would not know; about the C++ compiler. This is a problem in a set-up with executables; like:. /opt/newgcc/g++; /opt/newgcc/gfortran; /usr/bin/f95 (link to gfortran); /usr/bin/g++; /usr/bin/gfortran. Two versions of GCC are installed, one by the system, and one more; recent version in a separate directory. The directory to the newer; version is in the environment variable PATH before /usr/bin. In this; case the test from above (second attempt) would use /usr/bin/f95 as the; Fortran compiler, because Cmake usually prefers the executable f95 over; gfortran. This causes problems in case the two Fortran compilers are not; ABI compatible, i.e., gfortran 4.4 installed by the system vs. 4.9 as a; slightly more recent version. A simple enable_language (as in the; initial version) would correctly use /opt/newgcc/gfortran in this case.; This had to be worked around by setting the environment variable; FC=gfortran before running Cmake. To fix this, check_language is only used to determine whether a Fortran; compiler exists at all. If a compiler is found, then the; CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER variable is reset, and enable_language again; performs a search of the compiler, this time prefering a compiler from; the same vendor as the C++ compiler.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/891:2303,perform,performs,2303,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/891,1,['perform'],['performs']
