Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann @pcanal I believe that there are too many places that need to be changed when changing the default compression. We should have a single source of truth for the default, and use its value everywhere else. So, instead of using `1` and `4` directly, it would be much better to use `ROOT::DefaultCompressionAlgorithm` or something similar to that. One good reason for this is that it's really hard to find which `4`s mean `LZ4` and which are just a regular `4`. It also seems that `R__HAS_DEFAULT_LZMA` isn't used anywhere, so it would be quite hard to set the default to that at the moment. Finally, when a user sets the default on his/her config file to something else, it will not affect any of these places where `1` and `4` are used directly in ROOT. That's made even worse by the fact that setting `-Dcompression_default=lzma` at CMake configuration time will not change any of these as well, which will definitely make users very confused.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2492#issuecomment-414648413:852,configurat,configuration,852,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2492#issuecomment-414648413,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

I tested that this now works both for plain `TFile::Open` calls as well as with `TChain` and the redirection always happens as long as the file being opened is on EOS.

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann Thank you for looking at this! I thought of your approach also; using move semantics to transfer ownership means TGraph does not need to make a copy either. The idea on this branch is to demonstrate the potential for a significant performance speed-up in the constructor by not making a copy of the data. Additionally, sharing ownership with TGraph means a user can use the data for things apart from in a TGraph and/or update a TGraph after modifying the data. . In either approach, a user would still be able to use the existing TGraph constructors, however the ROOT file writing classes need an update to write `shared_ptr` or `vector` objects to a ROOT file. Thinking about this, another solution would be to use move semantics and to add a non-const accessor to the TGraph interface, which may work better when writing to a ROOT file.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682:434,update,update,434,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann yes, testing is one of the motivations, in particular continuous testing to prevent future regressions (now we can check against an external implementation, instead of just copying the current values and declaring them ""known-good""). The other reason, and why I think this might provide benefit for users, is performance: The original RANLUX implementation by James (at least its implementation in GSL) needs 40 seconds to sum 1 million numbers at luxury level 3, `gsl_rng_ranlux389` (luxury level 4) takes a bit more than 1 minute. The same sequence takes less than 8 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineJamesP[34]`, respectively (due to the LCG, you don't even pay for higher decorrelation!).; The difference is even larger for `std::ranlux48` (used directly, not through `std::uniform_real_distribution` which eats up more than one number per iteration): 2m55s compared to 12 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineStdRanlux48`. And because we can generate the same sequence, switching the generator won't change the output of a simulation / analysis / ... (only the interface is slightly different). Plus the users get the possibility to skip in the very same sequence without generating the intermediate numbers. Now we could argue that all users should switch to `RanluxppEngine2048`, which on top of that provides better seeding and even higher decorrelation. On the other hand, the implementations above have been around for some time now and are so widely available (`std::ranlux{24,48}` comes with any C++ compiler) that they will remain used...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772:68,continuous,continuous,68,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Keep `../../io/io` for instance ; - `make -j8` // this will creat `~/rootdoc`.

It isn't strictly necessary, but improves performance (I tried it out while trying to fix the bug in this PR), and it was something I wanted to do for a while already, so decided to keep it in.; - ee89d0c turns off building MultiProcess by default, as requested by you, @amadio.; - 84ac86e fixes a few remaining copyright/license headers that were introduced in #8700.; - 38c6de9 fixes some include dir variables in MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ.; - ~78aac0b~ 568ffdf is about building `MultiProcess` on Windows (includes @amadio's earlier review suggestion).; - ~5ab91be 0e21b70~ 1c5084f finally is what this PR is really about: adding the MP-based TestStatistics calculator classes and a README.md file with usage instructions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9349#issuecomment-984509014:286,install,installation,286,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9349#issuecomment-984509014,2,['install'],"['installation', 'installed']"
Deployability,"@amadio Thanks!. I have delved a bit into the recent changes, and I think it's this one:; https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/f45f2c283752de0a3a2fdc278b00d1653e116833; `ROOT_VERSION` appears to use the double-dot notiation, while most other user-exposed places (web page release announcements, banner etc.) use the other notiation. ; For example, the banner / logo uses `ROOT_RELEASE`, which still has the dot-slash notation:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/18b789c7ca051f09d84471fc948b410b61670f6e/core/base/src/TROOT.cxx#L699C23-L699C35. So probably, the main question is: Which notation is correct / should be used, and in case it's the double-dot notation, should `root-config` stay backwards-compatible? . In case the actual change linked above was not intended, but was just about dropping the `sed` (which is a good thing to do! :+1: ), maybe defining a CMake variable using the dot-slash notation in https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/18b789c7ca051f09d84471fc948b410b61670f6e/cmake/modules/SetROOTVersion.cmake; and using it in `root-config` would be best.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14068#issuecomment-1815217164:279,release,release,279,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14068#issuecomment-1815217164,1,['release'],['release']

This can be later used to know when it is safe to fill buffers from the next cluster. Allows us to avoid a read lock.; - @zzxuanyuan - hmm, I don't see this code in the current PR though? Am I overlooking something?.

Deployability,"@guitargeek @lmoneta Status update since yesterday's meeting:. - I added a README.md; - I fixed building without `roofit_multiprocess` (the problem was bigger than just Windows); - One thing that bugged me during yesterday's meeting was the `zmq.hpp` file that was back in the include directory. Indeed, it turned out it was still being ""installed"" (just copied with a manual command from CMake). I have now disabled this and fixed the include directories. Maybe this will also solve this remaining leaking symbols, but this will have to be thoroughly checked later on. I will rebase this into a separate commit in this PR, since it fixes the cppzmq builtin and is independent of `RooFit` per se.

Deployability,"@guitargeek thanks for the heads-up, I will fix those later. I have made a new commit, which addresses your and @hageboeck's review comments as much as possible. Point by point, let me quickly explain what changed:. - ""Upgraded"" comments on new functionality to doxygen. I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal.

Deployability,"@lmoneta I looked at the remaining failing tests. Edit: I fixed the standalone build and the clang-tidy-modernize issue. * clang-tidy-analyzer issues: I don't know how to address these in this PR and would like to propose to postpone fixing these in a separate PR. I looked through the complaints and those seem to be all related to memory management issues in Minuit2 that were there before, but are now uncovered since I touched so many lines of code. I didn't see any complaint related to my actual new logging code. I think a good deal of these issues can be resolved by replacing the MnRefCountedPointer with std::shared_ptr. Writing shared pointers correctly is hard, it is good that we have one in the stdlib now. I would like to do this in a separate PR. * clang-format issues: I would love to fix these clang-format issues. In fact, I would love to clang-format the whole Minuit2 code right now, but I think this should happen in a separate PR - or perhaps after the patch was fully reviewed.

Deployability,"@lmoneta The patch is ready for review. All logging is now done through `MnPrint`, which gained a static method `Log` with a severity level, a prefix for the actual message (usually set to the class name to indicate the origin of the message), and the actual message, which can consist of strings and streamable objects. For convenience, there are methods `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Debug`, which use a globally set prefix for convenience and to make the code more readable and less redundant. The global prefix is set with a scope guard. Thanks to RAII, this works also for nested scopes. . Since I was going through all the code anyway, I replaced some c headers with the corresponding cxx headers (e.g. math.h with cmath).

Deployability,"@pcanal @bbockelm . The updates address some issues for random read case and the code should be good now. Some updates after last Friday meeting:. As we discussed last Friday, random read performance is very slow. It technically cannot be improved if we decide to use cache. I also tried random read workload with pthread. The performance was the same with tbb. I think the reason is obvious that reading next random event will invalidate current cache and all baskets need to be reset and cache buffer has to be filled by next cluster of events. Based on current cache replacement policy, the slow performance is reasonable. Philippe pointed out the common use case for ROOT should be mostly sequential reads plus little random reads. I was thinking it would be not helpful if we store decompressed baskets by main thread (when cache miss happens) back to cache. Because for sequential read, they will not be accessed again, neither random reads since the cache will be invalidate and all decompressed baskets in cache should be marked as invalid.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1010#issuecomment-335354319:24,update,updates,24,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1010#issuecomment-335354319,2,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"@pcanal I ignore kSigAlarm is because it will trigger the function DispatchTimers(). This function is implemented in TUnixSystem but not defined in TSystem.

But I don't think it makes sense if we define them in TSystem. Update:; I tried to move DispatchTimers() into TSystem as an abstract function.

Deployability,"@sawenzel I get your point about thread safety, and agree that even the previous version was thread-unsafe, so I will deal with this later. The current version introduces a rather large critical section in `TGeoParallelWorld::InitSafetyVoxel` that blocks all concurrent threads even if they want to update the cache of different voxels, I would have pushed that lock a bit below where the update of the cache actually happens. But since this does not run in MT mode this is not critical now. Could you also do clang-formatting using ROOT style for the `bvh` part only (The entirety of TGeo is not yet formatted, but we will do it at some point), however the new files should be formatted. I looked and the internal thread pool is actually used for building the BVH in parallel, which is cool, but there may still be some unused headers, such as `sphere.h` - could you cross-check that and remove whatever is not needed?. The compilation errors on Mac are unrelated to your PR. Still, the compilation on alma8 with gcc8.5 fails, although it should not because the standard is set correctly to C++17 and the header <numeric> is included. ; ```; Error: /github/home/ROOT-CI/src/geom/geom/inc/bvh/v2/vec.h:99:17: error: ‘transform_reduce’ is not a member of ‘std’; ```; So @dpiparo what do we do about this since the `gcc` compliance with C++17 is known to be stable only starting with the gcc9 series?

Deployability,"@sazio, as I said on the other PR, you originally based your local work on the `latest-stable` branch, which is only used by users to get the latest release, but not to check in new content into ROOT's repository. As you see in the change diff, there are lots of changes that are not meant to be there (that you should also have seen before creating the pull request, in the ""Review changes"" section). Also there are a number of merge conflicts. You must solve this locally before creating the PR. You must rebase your commits on top of `master`, otherwise this is not going to work. Here's what I would recommend, provided that your actual commits are on a local branch called `latest-stable`:; ```bash; $ git branch -m latest-stable tmva-variable-plotter # Renames your local branch; $ git fetch origin master:master; $ git checkout tmva-variable-plotter. # Rebase your 'tmva-variable-plotter' branch onto 'master', provided that the fork point of your branch was 'origin/latest-stable'.; # The default editor will open showing a number of 'pick' lines; just verify that those commits are part of your work. You may; # need to fix any merge conflict that might happen here.; $ git rebase --interactive --onto master origin/latest-stable. # If you mess up at some point while rebasing, you can revert to the previous state issueing `$ git rebase --abort`. # Then push your changes to GitHub and open a new pull-request; $ git push ...; ```. Afterward, you can open a new pull request with origin on `sazio:tmva-variable-plotter` targetting `root-project:master`. Other than that, I will close this pull-request, as it cannot be merged in its current state.

Deployability,"@sazio, please, don't try to open a pull-request targeted at `root-project/stable-branch`. This branch is only used for release purposes. Pull requests usually targe the `master` branch, which is then used to tag new releases. It seems (by the branch name), that your work is also based on some revision of the `latest-stable` branch: GitHub will tell you if there is any merge conflict when you create a PR targeting `master` (quite possible, as `latest-stable` is always behind master).

Deployability,"@vgvassilev I have updated the PR to include a similar patch for the SourceManager and at least the trivial test seems to work fine, including a nice 9MB reduction in memory allocations. I am now testing with the ALICE analysis framework. I have also done a few of the cleanups, and it now only exposes an ""expand"" interface (basically resize without shrinking). AFAICT, it's not worth to implement the full ""resize"" functionality, given it's complicated and at least the places I fixed never shrink. I think also the calloc approach might not be a good idea given realloc does not guarantee that the memory is zeroed and besides that page ranges might be a tad too big for vector of pointers and so on. I would put aside that idea, at least for now. My current plan:. * Verify with larger tests using ALICE analysis and asynchronous reconstruction.; * Unify the two PagedVector implementations I currently have (one for ASTReader and one for SourceManager).; * Use fixed size ranges, so that I can get rid of the ranges in my internal index and just keep where each page was allocated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305:19,update,updated,19,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305,2,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'updated']"

Another problem which is still present in both the current master and even after this PR is that the number of file operations is still quite high, i.e.; ```; 532 newfstatat(3, ; 29 newfstatat(4, ; 10141 newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ; 546 openat(AT_FDCWD, ; 843 readlink(; ```. which are exactly the same whether current master or this patch. Consider that many of those `newfstatat` calls are spurious and I'm trying to understand where they come from. Take the following as an example; ```; newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ""/home/vpadulan/programs/rootproject/rootbuild/reduce-symbol-search-release/gui/sessionviewer/input_line_11"", 0x7ffde442f050, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory); ```. Note the presence of the `rootbuild` directory, which is the path where I store the ROOT build artifacts, even though I am using ROOT from the install directory. I thought it was something in the machinery of `(T)cling` but so far my tests haven't brought me to any conclusion. Another suspicion is that the path to the build directory is hardcoded somehow in the `.pcm` or in the AST and doesn't get converted to the install directory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890:115,hotfix,hotfixes,115,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890,5,"['hotfix', 'install', 'patch', 'release']","['hotfixes', 'install', 'patch', 'release']"

Deployability,"A `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` build option has been added so that it is now possible to customize the installation; directory of PyROOT & friends rather than forcing users/packagers to install PyROOT along the C++ libraries (which in turn makes it necessary to have a non-standard PYTHONPATH set otherwise ROOT.py is not found). At least as a first step, we limit the new feature to the case of new PyROOT,; non-Windows platforms and single-python builds. Python modules are now installed in `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, which for backward-compatibility defaults to the same value as `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` when not set explicitly at cmake configuration time. Note that treatment of `libcppyy.so` and `libcppyy_backend.so` is special: these libraries are needed by both python modules (namely, by cppyy) and C++ libraries (e.g. by `TPython`), so if `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` is different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` we install these files in `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` but also add symlinks to them in `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`. The cmake code that adds the symlinks is ugly but I could not make it work in any other way. Many thanks to @amadio for all the help getting this working.

Deployability,"After a debugging session with @bellenot , we have found out that `CXXRecordDecl` created for a `std::unique_ptr` on Windows will say that `RD->hasMoveConstructor()` is `false`, which imho is astonishing. We could surely introduce a small patch to cover the `unique_ptr` use case for Windows, but that will never scale to all classes that have a deleted copy constructor. Since this is blocking an experiment framework from moving forward, the support for Windows is not crucial, so in the latest commit I decided to remove the change on Windows builds. @vgvassilev The change is taken from cppyy's patches, but as you also suggested it's not trivial to just take all the code verbatim.

Deployability,"After reviewing the implementation of `RPageSinkBuf` and starting to prototype parallel RNTuple writing, I would like to propose moving the code related to descriptor building and serialization into a new class. The main observation here is that ""wrapping"" `RPageSink`s do not need that functionality, only the ""final"" sink that actually writes to files or DAOS. For now, I named the class `RPagePersistentSink`, but that's of course up for debate. Other options include ""final"" (even though that is ambiguous in the context of a class hierarchy) and ""serializing"". The first two commits may be useful independent of the rest of the series; the one to ""Avoid calling `PageSink::UpdateSchema` from `RPageSinkBuf`"" depends on moving the `Commit` implementations first (which access `fOpenColumnRanges` and `fOpenPageRanges`. *If* we decide that we want to introduce an intermediate class, we need to carefully benchmark with buffered writes disabled (ie without `RPageSinkBuf`) because there will now be two `virtual` function calls for every `Commit`; with `RPageSinkBuf` we avoid the duplicate serialization.

Deployability,"After updating to `clang-14.0.6-1.module_el8.7.0+1198+0c3eb6e2.x86_64`, many tests started failing when compiling ROOT with Clang (134 tests in my configuration). The reason seems to be that Clang is now built with [`GCC_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rh/gcc-toolset-12/root/usr`](https://git.centos.org/rpms/clang/c/4e0495208f843a286dc0d06d9abdc3433a66983a) to detect and use `libstdc++` from GCC 12. Even if that was not the case, https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/35aaf548237a4f213ba9d95de53b33c5ce1eadce in Clang 15 will have a similar effect for people building the compiler from source. According to our own documentation, ROOT does not guarantee [""compatibility with compilers shipped with `devtoolsets` on CentOS or Red Hat""](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/#caveats) which right now only leaves building with the system-default GCC 8.5 to get a fully working installation of ROOT.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11601:147,configurat,configuration,147,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11601,3,"['configurat', 'install']","['configuration', 'install', 'installation']"

Deployability,"After upgrading ROOT to 6.30, one of our applications also started giving us the error mentioned in this thread; ```; Fatal in <operator new>: with std::align_val_t is not implemented yet; ```; A little research led me to this: https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/aborting-with-std-align-val-t-is-not-implemented-yet-rhel-9-2/55989. If I understand correctly, this is the situation:. - `TMapFile` requires linking with libNew; - libNew is broken with -std=c++17 or higher (missing `operator new` overload); - ROOT 6.30 requires C++17; - Hence `TMapFile` (and actually all of `libNew`) is currently unusable in ROOT 6.30. There are no workarounds. Please elaborate if I am missing something. This is a bit of an issue. You do realize that EPEL 9 provides just such a broken version (ROOT 6.30.02 with -std=c++17). Hence, on RHEL 9/Alma 9 etc. (i.e. the current go-to version of Linux at many labs), anyone who needs to use `TMapFile` (or `libNew`) must downgrade to ROOT 6.28 and, possibly, compile by hand with -std=c++14. Additionally, on the latest version of macOS, Sonoma, only ROOT 6.30+ is supported. Hence, any code that uses `TMapFile` is inevitably broken at this time on the current version of macOS. The only ""workaround"" would be to downgrade (i.e. reinstall) the OS.; ; If I might make a suggestion: I would mention, or better: highlight, such regressions in the [release notes](https://root.cern/doc/v630/release-notes.html#release-6.3004) of a new version. Or better yet, not consider a new release ready until such significant regressions are resolved.

Deployability,"Apply [D41416](https://reviews.llvm.org/D41416) to reduce template specialization deserializations. This patch decreases the memory footprint of root startup by approx 17%. We deserialize 2 times less record types. See details [here](https://www.diffchecker.com/L2m1FE76). We cannot land D41416 in clang's trunk because in essence it replaces a liner algorithm with a quadratic one. We see the compilation time being approx 2 times slower clearly in one of the Google modules builds with approx 1000 modules with a lot of lazy specializations. While I am working on a better version of this patch, land it in our codebase because we do not have such extreme usage scenarios (yet?).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1526:105,patch,patch,105,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1526,2,['patch'],['patch']

This behavior is controlled by defining the `xxx_force_checkout=ON` CMake variable. Therefore, this PR also adds `roottest_force_checkout=ON` for the new CI.

It needs some change (for example `RPageSourceFile` needs to work with a `TMemFile`, ie we need a `RRawFileTFile` that wraps a `TFile` pointer), but then it mostly runs through. The only problem is that this code doesn't consider merging into a ntuple that already exists in the output file. As a result, all pages will be there but the meta data will only have the cluster(s) from the last merge. What we probably need is the `RPageSinkFile` for the destination to load an existing `RNTuple` anchor and append to it...

Since it does just refer to TGraph, I naturally assumed that it would support all DrawOptions of TGraph both for RooAbsData and RooAbsReal, which turned out not to be the case, which is the whole reason for the MR.; Now at least RooAbsReal supports ""P/E"" instead of just ""L/E"", which is already a step forward, but RooAbsData still only supports ""P/E"" I think since I didn't mess with that. It might be useful to add this fact to the respective documentation lines of ""DrawOption"".; But since this was not documented so far at all, the old documentation doesn't become invalidated by this patch.; What might be useful though is to add the lines; MarkerStyle(Int_t style) | Select the ROOT marker style, default is 21; MarkerColor(Int_t color) | Select the ROOT marker color, default is black; MarkerSize(Double_t size) | Select the ROOT marker size; from the RooAbsData documentation table of plotOn also to RooAbsReal, since for the draw option ""P"", they are now supported there.

Deployability,"As measured, there is an improvement if the expansion of `R__ASSERT()` is out of the inlined code path due to slighly more compact code.; Additionally, the `R__ASSERT(count > 0)` has been removed, given that `ClusterSize_t::ValueType` is an unsigned integral type. This was seen during the evaluation of the relative overhead of RField's post-read callbacks, which for reference I provide below. Two different tests were carried out: _(i)_ 4 fields of type `std::uint32_t`; and _(ii)_ 2 fields of type `std::uint32_t` + 2 fields of a user-defined struct, where:; - BASE refers to the current `master` with `RFieldBase::Read()` slightly changed to not support read callbacks.; - [1] refers to the current `master` + the changes in this PR; - [2] refers to the current `master` where `RFieldBase::InvokeReadCallbacks()` is also outlined by moving it to RField.cxx.

Deployability,"Assuming that `page_size` is a power of 2, the calculation of the base address of the page can be simplified and avoid a division. According to POSIX, either `MS_SYNC` or `MS_ASYNC` must be specified when calling `msync()`. Failure to include one of these flags will cause `msync()` to fail on some systems. When `msync()` returns -1, the pointer is only considered invalid when errno is set to `ENOMEM`. In principle, the other possible values for errno won't happen, but if they do, that should be considered an error, hence the assert condition needed an update. `EBUSY` shouldn't happen since we do not add `MS_INVALIDATE` to flags, and `EINVAL` shouldn't happen because we always pass a multiple of the page size to msync(). `EFAULT` is only used in Linux 2.4.18 and earlier instead of `ENOMEM`.

Deployability,"At a fundamental level the problem is that `RDataFrame` has some homegrown logic to figure out the type of a branch/leaf that is sensible to changes in behavior of `TTree::GetBranch` or `TTree::GetLeaf`. The problem RDataFrame has with this patch is that in the following repro, in which a `TClonesArray` branch is added to a `TTree`, behavior of `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` has changed: before this patch, it would return a nullptr (while `tree.GetBranch(""clonesarray"")` would return the branch; after this patch `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` returns a valid `TLeaf`, so RDataFrame thinks the type of the branch is `leaf->GetTypeName()`, which is `Int_t` for this branch containing `TClonesArray`. I don't think this change in behavior is intentional given that the PR is supposed to fix retrieval of leaves by their full name, not change the behavior of retrieval of leaves with no dot in their names?. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <TClonesArray.h>; #include <TH1D.h>. int main(); {; TClonesArray arr(""TH1D"", 3);; for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {; auto *h = static_cast<TH1D *>(arr.ConstructedAt(i));; h->SetBins(25, 0, 10);; h->Fill(i);; }; TTree t(""t"", ""t"");; t.Branch(""arr"", &arr);; t.Fill();. auto l = t.GetLeaf(""arr"");; if (l == nullptr) {; std::cout << ""leaf is null"" << std::endl; // this is what happens before this PR; return 0;; }. // this prints ""Int_t"", and it is what happens with this PR; std::cout << ""leaf has type name "" << l->GetTypeName() << std::endl;; return 0;; }; ```. P.S.; note that both before and after this patch, `TTree::GetListOfLeaves` does not report `""arr""` as a leaf:. ```; root [4] for (auto e : *t->GetListOfLeaves()) std::cout << e->GetName() << std::endl;; arr_; arr.TH1; arr.TArrayD; ```. P.P.S. it seems the problem is that with this patch `tree->GetLeaf(""arr"")` returns leaf called `""arr_""`:. ```cpp; ~/S/d/getleaf_problem root -l df_readwritetclonesarray.root ; root [0] ; Attaching file df_readwritetclonesarray.root ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615:241,patch,patch,241,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615,3,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"At the moment, `push` workflows pass `--base_ref master` to `build_root.py`. This means that they may actually pick up a later commit (= the current commit on the branch) at the time the job actually starts to run.

Unfortunately, fixing this isn't as easy as replacing; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/db6ff452b032b23251970046fd1febe066e4fa4d/.github/workflows/root-ci.yml#L456-L465; to pass `--base_ref ${{ github.sha }}` because `build_root.py` calls `git clone --branch {branch} --single-branch {repository}`.

Deployability,"Befor we switched JSROOT to the local instances of the JS libraries, we could use jupyter with all features right after sourcing `thisroot.*`. Due to the switch, the path to the JS libraries was broken, which is now fixed by this PR. This makes `root --notebook` redundant in this case. Still to be added is the correct behaviour when ROOT is installed. I'll line out here how it should be done:. 1. We should abandon the `.rootnb` folder in `HOME` and use the default `.jupyter` folder.; 2. There, we have to add our config to the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file, which is basically nothing else than `c.NotebookApp.extra_static_paths.append('/path/to/root/js')`.; 3. I think we should just get rid of the custom css things, which would be made default if installed into `.jupyter`.; 4. Install the ROOT kernel in `/usr/share/jupyter/kernels/root`, such as all other kernels. I would go first with this PR, which only improves the current behaviour. Next I'll have a look into a proper installation of our jupyter related files, but I'll make another PR for that. **Edit:** I've fixed the installation to a prefix.

This fixes #8450 as a side-effect. This PR also adds a test and improves the related docs. Rationale for the change in behavior of `GetColumnNames`: currently, in RDataFrame we have (fairly convoluted) logic to retrieve 3 different lists of branch names given a TTree/TChain:. 1. a user-readable of list of available column names returned by `df.GetColumnNames()`; 2. a larger list of all valid spellings for all column names, used to validate user inputs (this includes all names returned by `df.GetColumnNames()` plus alternative spellings such as `branchname.leafname` when `branchname == leafname`, shorthands for `friendname.branchname` as just `branchname`, etc.; 3. a list of only top-level branches that we use as the list of branches to `Snapshot` by default. Before this patch `df.GetColumnNames()` returned multiple valid spellings for the same friend branch. That can be confusing, so I'd rather (try to) return only one valid spelling for each available branch/leaf. For consistency with `Display` and to not withhold information from users, among the two valid spellings we always show the ""fully qualified friendname.branchname"". Users can still use the shorthand ""branchname"" if it's not ambiguous, as the relevant documentation now points out.; I think this solution is the sweet spot between not being surprising (to users and to RDF developers), being easy to implement without further complicating or completely refactoring the branch-retrieval logic and being somewhat backward-compatible.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8529:12,patch,patch,12,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8529,2,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"Beyond that, I still think you do not understand at all how this would work. You seem to think that it is either letting `BestViableFunction()` do all the work _or_ doing all the work myself. But there are many scenario's where inspecting the set can provide better arguments to `BestViableFunction()`, such as already mentioned: knowing which parameters to keep fixed, which qualifiers to use, which STL containers to target. That alone would be a win before going on the fully reimplement that call. Yes, friends are still an issue, but they're not supported today either yet. Yes, people need to know a name, that is true today, and always will be: nature of dynamic languages like Python. Those operators are a total non-issue, as I'm doing expression-based invocation already in my version of TClingCallFunc (precisely b/c templates and function-style do not mix), so yes, if you still have the same old code there in ROOT then it's totally a problem for PyROOT, but it's already fine for cppyy.
