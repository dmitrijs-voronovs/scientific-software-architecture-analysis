Deployability,"Since it's been a month I thought I'd post an update. Main items:; - In general I'm having to make a lot more changes to the Scala code than I expected due to queries being written in a way that Postgres doesn't like. (This isn't a criticism, more of a heads-up.) Nothing functional, just refactoring.; - The way `Blob` is handled in Slick+Postgres turns out to be a massive pain. I'm not sure if Slick is lazy-loading these fields or I just don't understand how it works under the hood, but the workaround is that the blobs need to be accessed as part of a transaction, which involved some refactoring of downstream processing.; - Semi-related question: is there a reason why the entire contents of the `importsZip` need to be stored in the database? This quickly leads to an enormous METADATA_ENTRY table - possibly because I have call caching turned on, I haven't checked whether this is the cause yet.; - The auto-incremented fields that are `Option[Long]` in the data model can't be handled the same way in Postgres; I haven't decided whether this is simply different database behavior or a bug somewhere. Anyway I found a workaround for that too.; - I may have messed up and branched from `master` in my fork by mistake, and in any case I'm definitely out of sync with your `develop`. Do you have a preferred workflow to bring my branch up to date, i.e. to minimize the mess in the Git history? (Despite using Git daily I'm still not totally sure what ""best practice"" is.).

Deployability,"So I think I'm now clear regarding the options on this thread. One option, and the original one discussed, is a container entrypoint (""Orchestrator"" as @danbills put it). Another option, which is what I originally thought was being discussed, is an always-running sidecar. That entrypoint container would then launch our target container, similar to something like https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/ or https://github.com/delagoya/batch-task-runner. IMHO, the entrypoint/Orchestrator introduces some unnecessary complexity. It works for a simple case, but leaves a lot of configuration as TBD. To implement this properly we'd need to implement a standard task definition for the entrypoint (or Orchestrator) container (simple), but also pass to that container all the necessary docker parameters necessary for implementing the target container (much more difficult). There is also the question of supervision for the target container as the entrypoint/Orchestrator is hiding from batch and Cromwell the actual task's status. Also, the permissions issues I brought up in my comment above apply. I also have some concerns about the implementation of this approach within Cromwell, as I believe (but I'm not certain), this scheme would require some non-trivial changes to the StandardAsyncExecutionActor class as well as the AwsBatchAsyncExecutionActor logic (likely moreso on the later). I haven't investigated, but I also have some concerns over whether this mechanism would require significant rework of the process input/output and return code. It looks like @delagoya may have considered this in the batch-task-runner repo, but I'm not clear on this after the limited time I've had reviewing the repo. So, with that in mind, I spent a bit of time researching the ""always on sidecar"" approach, which I'll reference as ""cromwell agent"" moving forward for clarity.

Deployability,"So far cromwell is working great on our cluster. Thanks a lot for this splendid effort. However there is one issue we run into that other people might run into as well. Our cluster uses NFS as its filesystem backend. This means that if one node completes a job, it might take a while before the files that were created. In other workflows we can set an I/O timeout option: if the file did not appear within 3 minutes, the job failed. How do we do this in cromwell. All the settings I have available is `number-of-requests`, `per` and `number-of-attempts`. Currently we have; ```HOCON; io {; number-of-requests = 10; per = 10 seconds; number-of-attempts = 180; }; ```; This should make sure that failing files are attempted for 180 seconds, but this is not very elegant. There is a `timeout` option in I/O. But this is the timeout for the I/O operation to respond. If the file is not ""visible"" then the I/O operation will respond immediately, and the job will have failed.

Deployability,"So two things are happening here:; * We can't create a new WDL type (without modifying the spec) but we can update the backend implementation in Cromwell to widen the supported values. My comment in the previous PR was making that case.; * We can only widen the supported values as far as the WDL spec allows.; * As of WDL draft-2 and 1.0, the supported width is unspecified; * As of WDL 2.0 it's defined thus: ; * `Float` is a finite 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point number.; * `Int` can be used to hold a signed Integer in the range `[-2^63, 2^63]`. . So I think the best thing we could do is support the data types specified in WDL 2.0. Even though we'd be technically compliant with WDL 1.0 by going wider, I think it's just going to cause us headaches later. I'd suggest starting by defining what we will and won't support by adding these test cases and trying to satisfy them:; * Support for the max value of a finite 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point number; * Disallowing the max value of a finite 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point number + 1; * Support for the min value of a finite 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point number; * Disallowing the min value of a finite 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point number - 1; * Support for the max value of a signed Integer in the range `[-2^63, 2^63]`; * Disallowing the max value of a signed Integer in the range `[-2^63, 2^63]` + 1; * Support for the min value of a signed Integer in the range `[-2^63, 2^63]`; * Disallowing the min value of a signed Integer in the range `[-2^63, 2^63]` - 1.

However, it will only do so in the specific case where the initial test failure happens when checking cache behavior, because that's the only time we have easy access to the id of the associated workflow. My assumption is that this will reduce the likelihood of this error but not eliminate it. . Before going back and making a larger change to pass an object containing all relevant workflow ids through a bunch of different test code, to ensure it can always be part of `CentaurTestException`, I wanted to get some initial feedback. Is this (adding additional workflow id(s) to `CentaurTestException` so that we can easily clear their cache hits from the database in `tryTryAgain`) the right direction to fix this problem? It feels wrong to update the signatures of all these unrelated methods just to populate the exception.

Deployability,"TB in testing so I don’t know if size is the problem. Does the issue persist after restarting the server? I committed a change to the develop branch a few weeks ago that does a better job of cleaning up the copying resources. If the restart solves the problem then you may want to build from the develop branch until the next release is sent out.

Deployability,"TL;DR 👍 post rebase and minor comments. ToL 1: I dislike that one can't `Paths.get(Paths.get(""gs://bucket/path"").toString)`, and one must insert a `.toUri` for this to work. Hopefully this will be updated over in GCS NIO in the future and we can convert all the `.toUri.toString` back to `.toString`. ToL 2: Already discussed with Thibault. I concur that I don't like the proxy classes for long term. I'm picturing a custom cromwell wrapper that externally retries `Path.copy(): Unit`. Right now the proxy `.copy()` themselves are retrying internally while blocking the `Unit`. This custom wrapper should have a different behavior. Possibly a method returning a scala `Future`, even better Akka actors using messages and supervisors!.

Deployability,"TOL and assuming the investigation requested above confirms it would be helpful:. The current blacklisting implementation asks ""did a read from this source bucket result in a 403?"" If the answer is no, Cromwell tries to copy from that source bucket at full blast. However if Cromwell's first attempts to read from that source bucket do in fact result in 403s, there can be a large number of failed copies before blacklisting kicks in. One possibility would be modifying the question to ""what is the status of this source bucket with respect to 403s?"" with valid responses of ""known good"", ""known bad"" and ""I don't know"". . For ""I don't know"" Cromwell could be more cautious in its handling of that source bucket and launch a single ""canary"" copy attempt. Based on the result of that canary attempt Cromwell could choose ""known good"" or ""known bad"" and blacklisting could proceed the same as it does today with fewer copy failures.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4768#issuecomment-475667497:733,canary,canary,733,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4768#issuecomment-475667497,2,['canary'],['canary']

But because it's being called from the main workflow, that still works. It seems to be that you can say ""all file references based off the launching directory work"", or ""no file references based off the launching directory work, you have to evaluate the reference based on the location of the file that made the reference"". Saying ""sometimes it will work, and sometimes it won't. We know you've been depending on this behavior, but we're nuking it anyway""? That, I would say, is rather user unfriendly. 3: All that said, that change, making a called workflow behave significantly differently from the starting workflow, was at least easily dealt with. (I wrote a python script to update the import statements.) But the change that called workflows no longer get passed anything from the JSON file.

Deployability,"Thanks @illusional, I've come to a very similar configuration, albeit for singularity 3.X. I ended up settling on this:. ```; submit-docker = """"""; export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/data/cephfs/punim0751/singularity_cache; module load Singularity/3.0.3-spartan_gcc-6.2.0; IMAGE=/data/cephfs/punim0751/${docker}; singularity build --sandbox $IMAGE docker://${docker} > /dev/null; sbatch -J ${job_name} -D ${cwd} -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr -t ${runtime_minutes} \; ${""-c "" + cpus} \; --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \; --wrap ""singularity exec --userns -B ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} $IMAGE ${job_shell} ${script}""; """"""; ```. Just two things I'd like to discuss. Firstly, because you are pulling the docker image inside the sbatch script, this depends on the cluster you're working on allowing network access for the workers. While that is possible on our local cluster, my discussion with some sysadmins made me realise that this wasn't necessarily commonplace, and even on our cluster they strongly discouraged me from relying too heavily on it. This made me look for a solution that was even more generalizable. This is why I `singularity build` the image before I submit it, using the head node. This ensures that all network-requiring work is done on the head node, where network access is guaranteed. I also make sure to set a cache directory, so we don't download the same docker image multiple times in the case of a scatter job etc. Of course, if you do have network access for your workers and the admins have no issue with you using it, pulling the image from the worker is probably a better option to avoid hogging the head node. The second main difference in my config is that the singularity binary I was using did not have `setuid` permissions, meaning that I had to use the sandbox format, and run the image using `--userns`. This is obviously only required if your sysadmins don't trust `singularity`, but I think it's important to demonstrate a way of runni",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039#issuecomment-461281475:48,configurat,configuration,48,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039#issuecomment-461281475,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"Thanks @rhpvorderman for the suggestions. . We are running wdl pipelines for single cell workloads that have thousands of concurrent tasks working on a dozen files each. Just the filesystem metadata operations alone are an issue for the filesystem, let alone whether the amount of data fetched is small. We were already hitting a wall in job submission speed due to this issue, we've been running cromwell with these changes in production now without issues. Reducing the number of threads would also reduce the task throughput and limit performance. #4900 is not what we need because we dont want to waste time copying when we can just soft-link.

Deployability,"Thanks for pointing out the Cromwell/PAPI v2 beta support for docker image caches, I wasn't aware of this feature. . After reading the documentation at https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/Google/#docker-image-cache-support, I have a few additional questions about how this could help with the problem described in this issue. . It looks like docker image caching needs to be configured at the Cromwell server level with a manifest file indicating the location of images. Are the images listed in the manifest truly global (as indicated in their paths, ie `projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/..`), so they won't incur egress to use them to create VMs in different regions? Can they be made public for use by users in other projects?. For an external user already running their own cromwell instance in a different region who wants to run our pipeline, we'd need to publish an image caching configuration stanza and manifest file along with our workflow, and the administrator of the cromwell server would need to modify their server configuration to point to our manifest file and restart the server -- is that correct? If their cromwell server was already configured with a different image cache manifest, is there a way to add a second manifest, or would they have to edit their own cache manifest to include the entries in ours?. If I'm right in my understanding (please correct me if I'm not) it seems like this solution could help, but is quite cumbersome and requires very savvy external users who are willing to take extra steps to help prevent saddling us with egress charges. It would be great if a cache manifest could be configured at the workflow level -- perhaps in the wdl or the workflow options.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442#issuecomment-887774738:869,pipeline,pipeline,869,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442#issuecomment-887774738,3,"['configurat', 'pipeline']","['configuration', 'pipeline']"

Deployability,"Thanks for reviewing this, so far I don't expect considerable code changes to be made. I have saw that you approved a few other PRs, it could be a good idea to wait for them to get merged before reviewing this one to reduce the diff. > 1. -e is for exclude. There is a papi_v2beta_gcsa.test that should be running under Batch still. I believe the Beta version is a fairly essential test because it checks the configuration Terra uses for auth (though I'm not 100% sure on this one). I have not familiarized myself yet with Centaur which is why I preferred asking. > 2. We use Codecov as an advisory thing, if the human developers think the tests are solid, they're solid. I was thinking that there could be a wrong setup, perhaps running the wrong tests which would explain why code with tests was marked with no coverage, still, I have the impression that the behavior improved since #7418 was merged. > 3. I think I'd need to know more detail about what the test checks for and how it fails. Looking at the comment in StandardAsyncExecutionActor#requestsAbortAndDiesImmediately, it does seem like we may want the false behavior because it's responsible for some finalization activities around the job. Agree, do you have any insights on how can I possibly test this to save some research time?. > 4.. 100 workers seems like a lot? I think our default for PAPI is 3, and we stick to that default in Terra. Is the Batch behavior radically different, motivating 100? I totally agree that the formula could use re-evaluation (or maybe even elimination). Yes, they are quite a lot but we were testing different parameters and found this behavior, still, it seems worth to leave this for another PR. > 5. That seems fine. So long as we have some kind of handling for every case in com.google.cloud.batch.v1.JobStatus.State` we should be good. The execution events are designed to be tied closely to the implementation of the backend with minimal translation or invention of new states.

Deployability,"Thanks so much for the pointer to the hashing and details about adjusting that. You're exactly right that was what was happening. I saw the hash error and saw no new jobs launched, thought it had failed, so must have stopped the tasks before they finished the md5 summing and continued. I ran our analysis both with md5 checksumming and path based hashing, and it does save some time. The md5 based one took 6:43 and path based was 5:55. Doing based on paths works great for us so I'll swap to that as the default in bcbio pipelines. For database storage, are their known deficiencies with file based HSQL over MySQL? Do I have ways to mitigate those through different settings? We're planning to use MySQL in some circumstances but for providing something generally for users the file-based database will be the default and I'd like to make that as good and error free as possible. Is leaving this open for the `null` hash issue worthwhile? I also got some other hash errors on a different run that didn't affect completion but might be influencing re-use and storage that I could raise an issue on, but might be due to file based storage.

Deployability,Thanks to @ruchim both Green (single sample / arrays) workflows are integrated into the Jenkins [tyburn-cromwell-test](https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/tyburn-cromwell-test/) job. This job runs daily at 8 am M-F currently and is governed by the Jenkins [tyburn-master-job](https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/tyburn-master-test/) The code is not checked into develop because of Tyburn history 😡 so all the integrated test code is located on the rm_startingPoint [branch](https://github.com/broadinstitute/tyburn/tree/rm_startingPoint). Hopefully it will be back in develop soon but it probably wont be before my sabbatical is over so this is the current state of things. In the [configure](https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/tyburn-cromwell-test/configure) of the jenkins tyburn-cromwell-test job there is a script section where we invoke the tyburn command we use to run the test. Here you can config values that change shape the test. ```; -Dexecutioners.workflowToInstance.singlesample=1 \; -Dexecutioners.workflowToInstance.arrays=1 \; -Dexecutioners.workflowToInstance.lots_of_inputs=1 \; ```.

Deployability,"Thanks, @vsoch, I will look into the new caching functionality once 3.1.0 is fully released, and I'll open an issue soon. The reason this matters is because if we run a scatter job in Cromwell where we have multiple jobs running the same image, they will all simultaneously try to rebuild the image file, which I imagine will catastrophically fail. But now that I think about it, if the image does need updating this will still cause it to fail. I might have to think about some kind of locking mechanism to use here.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4635#issuecomment-463885163:83,release,released,83,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4635#issuecomment-463885163,1,['release'],['released']
Deployability,"Thanks, this is much better. Given this behavior, it would be good to update the issue summary to match, with something like: `Cromwell File to String conversion uses input name, not localized path name`. Regarding this behavior, the relevant part of the spec that I see says:. > When a WDL author uses a File input in their Command Section, the fully qualified, localized path to the file is substituted into the command string. As I read this, the point is that `File` has special behavior inside a command block. Outside of a command block, it has no special behavior, and therefore when converted to `String` it has the path that was provided as an input. So to me it seems that cromwell's behavior is consistent with the spec.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5785#issuecomment-678343746:70,update,update,70,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5785#issuecomment-678343746,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"That's a cool use of this configuration to work around this issue !. I just want to give some context around it. This rate control was originally put in place to protect Cromwell against excessive load or a very large spike of jobs becoming runnable in a short period of time. Through this mechanism Cromwell can also stop starting new jobs altogether when under too heavy load.; While this achieve the desired effect of rate limiting how many submit requests are being sent to AWS batch in a period of time, I think a medium-term better fix is too implement something similar to the [PipelinesApiRequestManager](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/api/PipelinesApiRequestManager.scala) for the AWS backend.; The reason is that it acts as a coarse level of granularity which might have undesired side-effects:. 1) it is a system wide configuration, meaning in a multi backend Cromwell it might be too constraining for some backends and not enough for others; 2) It also rate limits starting jobs that might actually be call cached and incur 0 requests to AWS Batch, making it too conservative; 3) It only helps rate limiting the number of job creation requests to batch. Once a job is started, it issues status requests to monitor the job which aren't throttled. Not to say that this is a bad workaround, I think it's a *good* workaround, but still a workaround :)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4303#issuecomment-444253181:26,configurat,configuration,26,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4303#issuecomment-444253181,6,"['Pipeline', 'configurat', 'pipeline']","['PipelinesApiRequestManager', 'configuration', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"The `DrsCloudNioFileSystemProvider` was wrapping the retries of the `DrsPathResolver` with another set of `CloudNioRetry` retries. The product of these two retries at the previous configuration values would wait around 35 minutes (~:20 + 10 x ~3:30) to fail for each doomed attempt. That combined with a fairly wide scatter and a typo'd DRS path for `file` in code like . ```; task size {; input {; File file; }. Int file_size = ceil(size(file)); ...; }; ```; would completely block all 10 of the `IoActor`s [NIO threads](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/engine/src/main/scala/cromwell/server/CromwellRootActor.scala#L108). These changes remove the nested retries in the engine and dial back the patience for retries. If we want the retries to be more patient we'll probably have to make other code that is competing for `IoActor` threads more patient as well.

Deployability,"Theory 1:; I've also seen this issue. I've set our `concurrent-job-limit` parameter in the backend to 150 and yet the number of concurrent jobs (including those pending) seems to stay at around 60-65. . Could the other 90 be from tasks that still need to be 'ticked off' as complete?. My suspicion on this is that the `check-alive` parameter in the config is set to `squeue -j ${job_id}`.; On our cluster we have around 3 hours to continue running commands like `scontrol show job` to see the metadata on the job and find logs. This is useful but, `squeue -j ${job_id}` still returns true well and truly after the job has completed/failed. Could you try massively increasing the job limit (to say 10000) and see if that changes anything?. Theory 2:; Your configuration file could need a scale up - it may be that the number of system io requests require increasing:. ```; system {; io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; number-of-attempts = 50; }; ```. Will allow your job to make 1000 requests per second. For some of those batch calling jobs with many vcf inputs, it may be taking some time for the server to set up the task?. Theory 3:; Your duplication-strategy is causing lag.; Can you confirm that in providers.slurm.filesystems that you have hard-link or soft-link as the top priority for the localization and caching settings, over copying?.

Deployability,"There are at least four spots in `WorkflowExecutionActor` where `==` is invoked on `Scope`s. This is not so good as `==` in Scala does a deep equals, and the `Scope` implementations are case classes with compiler-generated `equals` and `hashCode` implementations. These implementations invoke `equals`/`hashCode` on their constructor fields, including `Task` which contains a lot of hairy stuff including ASTs. This is extra bad in `WorkflowExecutionActor` since these `==`s are invoked synchronously with message processing to update the execution store, and all this computation is effectively single-threaded within a workflow. In practice, for a 20K wide scatter this causes the `WorkflowExecutionActor` to spend upwards of 20 minutes from the time work finishes in (mock) JES to actually succeeding the workflow. I _think_ this might be fixed by chasing down all the spots where `==` is used on `Scope`s and replacing that with call FQN + index + attempt comparisons instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1457:528,update,update,528,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1457,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"This is also something we would want for our cluster. Users are not allowed to run docker containers on our HPC (that would give them root access :scream:). So we use cromwell on the command line instead. We modified our cromwell configuration to run with singularity containers instead of docker containers. Setting up a MySQL server somewhere is not easy for the average user. Furthermore we used to set up a MySQL server for all users on the cluster, but that meant they had to share a database user and password (they were all using the same configuration). This caused a lot of issues. . Mostly cromwell is run project based. So the call-caching is only interesting for that particular project. Also using a file-based database will automatically ensure that only people with rights to the share the project is on will have access. This is also of importance in a shared cluster environment. At LUMC we currently implement this by using the HSQLDB in-memory database with a persistence file. This has some disadvantages:; 1. Cromwell needs more memory compared to using a MySQL server; 2. The HSQLDB persistence files are huge, badly compressed (when compression is used). 3 GB is normal. Tarring and zipping will get this down to under <50 mb... ; 3. It is slower than using a MySQL server. I think that SQLite will solve problem 1 and 2. (3 is inherent to using a file-based DB). . Having a database is better than to have nothing at all, which is why many users are pining for SQLite. When looking into it I found the option for the persistence file. Although SQLite will be much better, this does not require any extra effort from the Cromwell developers and can already help out a lot of users.

Deployability,"This is green and actually does appear to work with a couple of mods to the three-step workflow, one to fake the `ps` for deterministic results, another to fix a bug in the wc command. But this seriously needs refactoring:; 1. Proper concurrency handling for store updates. The current code is awful, the mutable stores are just passed around the various concurrently executing actors. Probably the stores should be behind an actor which the CallActor and WorkflowActor would `ask` for queries or updates, and then compose a `pipeTo` with the `Future` response.; 2. While the potential parallelism of the cgrep and wc calls does appear to work as intended, the current test does not assert this.; 3. The call dependency determination only works for member access expressions and is kind of gross.; 4. The connection of inputs to outputs requires member access expressions and uses logic very much like point 3. Also the way outputs are copied to inputs in the symbol store seems clunky and wasteful; if the input expressions could be truly evaluated at call invocation it wouldn't be necessary to create copies of this data.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/20:265,update,updates,265,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/20,2,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"This proposal should give us more flexibility regarding docker tags while keeping the call caching safety on false positive / negative. Docker runtime attributes with docker hashes do not need any additional processing. All logic in this ticket applies to docker runtime attributes with a ""floating"" tag, which will be referred as ""tag"" in this issue. In all cases, if Cromwell fails to retrieve the docker hash for a task, for any reason, the corresponding call(s) will NOT be eligible for call caching, neither read nor write, regardless of the call caching configuration in effect. **When to get the hashes and what to do with them:**. 1. Cromwell will lookup the hashes corresponding to docker tags, for all docker attributes in all tasks in a workflow and its subworkflows, at Materialization time.; If the runtime attribute value can't be determined, the task in question will be ineligible for call caching. The only case when that should be true is if the attribute is an expression with variables depending on previous tasks being run. 2. If the hash lookup succeed, Cromwell will use that hash to perform any call cache read / write according to the call caching configuration in effect. It will also provide that hash, along with the original floating tag, to the backend when the job gets dispatched. 3. Backends will choose wether to use the hash or the floating tag. They will report to the engine which one they used, so that the engine can send this information to the metadata. **How to get the hash:**. 1. How to get the hash depends on the backend. Which means, at this time, that only workflows for which the backend is known statically at workflow submission time will be supported. 2. If the task is expected to run on the **Local Backend**, Cromwell will attempt to find the hash corresponding to the tag on the machine where it's being run.

Deployability,"This pull request will trigger CI to run for the newly added configuration. . ## What does it do?; Specifically, this test builds and deploys a docker development container with sbt and scala to build cromwell. . ## How is it tested?; The user is instructed to bind the source code with ""sbt assembly"" in the `/code` directory in the container after binding the root of this repository to `/code`. Since we cannot have volumes in circle, we instead just test the added code to the container, also located at `/code`. Since the purpose of this container is to be a clean slate with sbt, scala to build cromwell, the primary test that is important is ensuring that `sbt assembly` runs successfully without a hitch. Any other ""docker"" tests for the actual cromwell (not building it) would not belong here, but with Docker containers meant to deploy cromwell proper. # Where does it deploy?; The container will deploy to the `CONTAINER_NAME` defined in the circle environment settings (or in the circle config at `.circleci/config.yml`. By default, it will be tagged with the commit first 10 characters, and then latest, and you can change this behavior by defining `DOCKER_TAG` either in the config or circle environment (I don't see a reason to do this). Note that deploy is ONLY set up to happen on pushes to master (and you can change this to also be develop, if you choose, or to be both and then to deploy to tags `<branch>-<commit>` or something like that. ## Background; This was first done at the repo [vsoch/cromwell](https://github.com/vsoch/cromwell/pull/1) to test since I can't set it up for the broadinstitute.

Deployability,"This sets up a mechanism to:; 1) Collect information about ""load"" from various part of the system; 2) Summarize this information and calculate a global load; 3) Notify parts of the system of changes in the global load. Current implementation is simple:; Only 2 load levels: `NormalLoad` and `HighLoad`; Actors reporting their load are:; - WriteMetadataActor; - JobStoreReadActor; - JobStoreWriteActor; - CallCacheWriteActor; - CallCacheReadActor; - KeyValueReadActor; - KeyValueWriteActor; - IoActor; - JesAPIQueryManagerActor. Additionally free memory is also being monitored and will go to `HighLoad` if going below a certain threshold. Global load == max(all load levels). So if one actor or more say their load is high, the global load will be high, otherwise normal.; The only actor listening to changes on the global load is the job token dispenser. It will stop dispensing tokens when load is high and start again when load is back to normal. At the exception of the IoActor, all the above mentioned actors have a queue in which they store work to be done. Their load is determined by comparing the size of this queue to a threshold.; The IoActor's queue is not easily accessible because hidden in the stream implementation and its size cannot easily be known. However we know when its full because we can't add to it anymore (this is when backpressure messages are sent). When that happens the IO actor reports its load to be `High`. When it hasn't had to backpressure for 10 seconds, the load returns to normal. There are many ways this could be made smarter but it already yields improvements in terms of stability and robustness.

The interplay between restart and caching is possibly not ideal.

However, Cromwell currently does this calculation before checking if jobs were actually running and recoverable, which if they were would make hash calculation unnecessary. .

Not sure why it doesn't show up here, but this permission is required for the Cromwell server to be able to run a pipeline with a Compute SA. BTW `iam.serviceAccountUser` **should** be granted on a per-service-account level, not at the project level (not sure if you've set it up this way, just wanted to confirm).

The main goal is to refactor Batch backend to include [PipelinesApiRequestManager](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/api/PipelinesApiRequestManager.scala) and [PipelinesApiRequestWorker](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/api/PipelinesApiRequestWorker.scala). This also fixes a few missing details from the initial Batch integration (#7177), for example:; 1. Missing metrics are now published.; 2. The job status is queried before deleting it to try preventing the deletion of jobs that are in a final state (PAPI can abort jobs but Batch deletes them instead). I have been trying to split this into multiple smaller PRs, please let me know if you can find any piece that can be submitted independently, previous PRs:. - #7413; - #7394 ; - #7411; - #7410 ; - #7393; - #7421; - #7428. <details>; <summary>Questions (already resolved)</summary>. ## Questions. 1. There is a centaur test included in the Batch suite, still, this seems to invoke a papi test [testCentaurGcpBatch.sh](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/src/ci/bin/testCentaurGcpBatch.sh#L25) (see [papi_v2alpha1_gcsa.test](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/centaur/src/main/resources/standardTestCases/papi_v2alpha1_gcsa.test#L3), the test itself says that batch backend is not used). Could this be related to the false-alarms from codecoverage's bot?; 2. There warnings raised by codecov which seem wrong, for example, the lines mentioned on [GcpBatchGroupedRequests](https",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7412:207,Pipeline,PipelinesApiRequestManager,207,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7412,9,"['Pipeline', 'integrat', 'pipeline']","['PipelinesApiRequestManager', 'PipelinesApiRequestWorker', 'integration', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"We have the same issue; we use an OGE back-end that implements hard limits on resource utilization which will terminate jobs that exceed these limits without allowing them to create an rc file. Currently we are running local mode cromwell instances with a workaround of putting a time-limit on the cromwell task of 48 hours, but this is extremely wasteful of our back end resources (cromwell itself consumes a large amount of memory on our cluster nodes). Our current workarounds involve putting a soft-limit on each job, attempting to trap SIGUSR1 in advance of the job being killed by the queue manager, at which point they create an rc file with a non-zero error code, but there is no guarantee that we can catch every instance of this. . Ideally we would like for cromwell to query running jobs at a user configurable interval (optionally never, but not as often as the file system is pinged for rc files so as not to burden the scheduler) against its list of jobs that are both not finished, and running and at minimum trigger the equivalent error state of a non-zero rc file return code. .

For both situations, the following statements will be true:. - When one of these events happens we will determine if the job is retryable (see below for criteria); - If the job is not retryable it will be failed; - If the job is retryable; -- An event will be sent to the metadata service; -- The retry will be logged; -- The attempt number shall be incremented ; -- The job will be attempted again.

Deployability,"We would like to handle certain JES VM errors in a manner which allows for some automatic retries prior to failing the job. There will be two categories, each handled slightly differently from the other:. Preemption for preemptible VMs (i.e. Error 14); JES error codes other than preemption which we believe to be transient (e.g. Error 13); For both situations, the following statements will be true:. When one of these events happens we will determine if the job is retryable (see below for criteria); If the job is not retryable it will be failed; If the job is retryable; -- An event will be sent to the metadata service; -- The retry will be logged; -- The attempt number shall be incremented; -- The job will be attempted again; In terms of visibility to the end user, preemption shall be handled exactly as it is now.

In the logs for the task, embedded into the standard error from the operations, I get the following signature:. ```; time=""2018-03-07T14:17:55+01:00"" level=error msg=""error waiting for container: read tcp 192.168.99.1:56961->192.168.99.101:2376: read: operation timed out""; ```. And the `rc` file is marked with `-1`. I cannot continue on this return code, because the task is still running on the container and continuing assumes that the operation is finished. My local configuration file looks like this:. ```; include required(classpath(""application"")). ## keep always the workflow logs; workflow-options.workflow-log-temporary: false. backend.providers.Local.config {; ## limit the number of jobs; concurrent-job-limit = 10; filesystems.local {; ## do not allow copy (huge files); ## prefer hard-links; localization: [""hard-link"", ""soft-link""]; caching.duplication-strategy: [""hard-link"", ""soft-link""]; }; }; ```. And the cromwell command is (using a `brew` installed wrapper):. ```bash; JAVA_OPTS=""-Dconfig.file=local.conf"" cromwell run --inputs inputs.json --metadata-output metadata-output.json workflow.wdl; ```. This error is happening for different workflows and tasks, so it is very difficult to account for it. In addition, a long-run workflow stops for this and requires a retry of the whole pipeline in my system, so it is really a problem when trying to run a time-consuming workflow that requires re-start for non-real failures.

Rebooting Cromwell fixes the problem.

Yesterday 6/15 I discovered that the JVM has a DNS cache with an infinite TTL [3]. Lowering this to a reasonable value allowed my test scenario to work without restarting the JVM, which it didn't before. Here is my theory:; 1. A Docker repo starts taking on water and engineers scramble to fix it; 2. They make infrastructure changes that change DNS records.; 3. Cromwell's retained DNS record breaks the ability to communicate with the repo indefinitely, even after the outage is resolved.; 4. Restarting Cromwell clears the cache.

It is also very broadly popular. > Could we replace HSQL with SQLite so that we can aren't maintaining two embedded database implementations?. Replacing HSQL with SQLite and making SQLite default has multiple advantages:; - HSQL uses a lot of memory for the in-memory database. SQLite is probably more efficient (testing required); - With SQLite a file-based database could be enabled by default (in `<<CROMWELL_ROOT>>/cromwell-db.sqlite`) which would enable call-caching by default for people using it from the command line with the run command.; - If the filebased database is enabled by default, there is no need for most users to get into the details of getting a proper database server running. However HSQL has the advantage that it is very well supported by slick and other java/scala practice (HSQL is itself written in Java) and that it requires minimal code to get it working.

The significant changes since the completed pull request for the SLURM configuration have been; 1. addition of `script-epilogue = """"` to eliminate the sync behavior after completing tasks. Sync caused some jobs to wait beyond their runtime limits for the sync to complete. ; 2. `concurrent-job-limit` to limit number of jobs submitted to scheduler. The HMS staff will kill all jobs if you submit lots (many hundreds?) of jobs that complete too quickly (<1min) because this creates a bottleneck at the scheduler. `concurrent-job-limit` obviates the need to substantially rewrite the workflow, and in my case contention with other users usually limits the number of compute nodes available more than `concurrent-job-limit`. . #1499 was a problem during pipeline development, and as a result I use very generous runtime limits for all jobs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1750#issuecomment-328217401:106,configurat,configuration,106,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1750#issuecomment-328217401,2,"['configurat', 'pipeline']","['configuration', 'pipeline']"

Deployability,"Yes, that's a valid alternative approach @notestaff. The tradeoff here is that by using the environment variables, no additional permissions are required for the process running Cromwell. By using an S3 bucket, we gain the ability of unlimited output size, but also increase the amount of configuration and permissions required to successfully run Cromwell. I think a good enhancement would be to add the ability to pass these things through S3 and let the user decide which mechanism and tradeoffs they would like. This said, removing the need for AWS_CROMWELL_OUTPUTS_GZ doesn't actually solve the 8k limit issue. In the testing for haplotype caller, some of the commands **themselves** are larger than 8k, even without considering environment variables. So, regardless of the environment variable compression, some solution is still needed for command text compression. I plan to file a couple PRs on the ECS Agent repo to get the conversation started with ECS and AWS Batch service teams on the limit and the mechanism being used to pass data between the services.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4216#issuecomment-427590325:289,configurat,configuration,289,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4216#issuecomment-427590325,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"[Per @mbookman]; This pull request is an initial update to address:. CROM-6718: FR: Add flag for minimizing chance of GCP cross-region network egress charges being incurred. This PR specifically focuses on the risks of egress charges incurred due to call caching. The framing of the approach here, which is a bit broader than originally noted in CROM-6718, is:; Make call caching location-aware, prioritizing copies that minimize egress charges.; Add a workflow option enabling control of what egress charges can be incurred for call cache copying.; The new workflow option would be:. call_cache_egress: [none, continental, global]. where the values affect whether call cache copies can incur egress charges:; none: only within-region copies are allowed, which generate no egress charges; continental: within content copies are allowed; within-content copies have reduced costs, such as $0.01 / GB in the US; global: copies across all regions are allowed. Cross-content egress charges can be much higher (ranging from $0.08 / GB up to $0.23 / GB). ### CURRENT STATUS OF PR:; These first few commits are a WIP/request for feedback. I would love discussion on what the best approach would be. The idea for this initial approach is to raise an exception right before copying cached outputs if the bucket locations would cause an egress charge (depending on workflow option). The CallCacheJobActor continue attempting to copy outputs until it finds one that doesn't cause an egress charge (depending on workflow option), or until it determines cache miss. . If the above approach is reasonable then I would need coding advice on:; 1) How do I properly use GcsBatchCommandBuilder.locationCommand (or something similar) in the CacheHitCopyingActor?; 2) How do I properly get the WorkflowOption CallCacheEgress in the CacheHitCopyingActor?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6324:49,update,update,49,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6324,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"[The ticket](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/DDO-2190) has a ton more info and I talked with @aednichols about this--the short version is:; - Whatever is doing the HTTP request to Cromwell (Akka?) does not set the Host header ([per MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host)) if it has been customized beforehand; - We've accidentally been doing that by copying the _request's_ headers that came into CromIAM, which obviously include the Host header correlating to CromIAM itself; - Thus CromIAM sends requests to Cromwell with an incorrect Host header; - This hasn't mattered before because Cromwell's Layer 4 load balancer doesn't care and Cromwell's Apache proxy didn't actually need to do host-based routing because it just forwards everything to one app, Cromwell; - This suddenly matters a lot now because BEEs use an Nginx controller for ingress instead of a GCP Layer 4 load balancer, and _it_ needs to use host-based routing; - TL;DR: CromIAM is proxying to Cromwell wrong-ish and it very much does not work in BEEs. Solution: strip out the Host header just like CromIAM already does for Timeout-Access, and everything is happy. The impact to live environments should be zero because they clearly didn't care about the header before. If this fails anywhere, Argo sees the failure immediately like it did for BEEs, and it sees it in a way that any deployment or promotion would be halted because CromIAM would fail to come online from Argo's perspective.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6803:1394,deploy,deployment,1394,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6803,1,['deploy'],['deployment']

One of our Integration Tests was failing due to a python dependency issue described [here](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/3113). Long story short, using an older version of `requests` is a workaround to an issue that exists in the python `docker` package. Until that package gets updated, our script will fail due to the docker library passing an invalid argument to the requests library. . This fix forces the github runner that is running the HoricromtalDeadlock test to downgrade its `requests` package, resolving the issue. This change will not affect anything other than that one test. .

I was under the impression through the comment from @kshakir [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1499#issuecomment-328880929):. > - Currently the mechanism for ""checking if a job is done""-- in tests and main code-- is to look for rc files; > - On restart if the rc file is missing, there's a single extra check to the scheduler to see if the job is alive, by running a external command line process per job. However, when I restart a Cromwell-39 server, it calls the `check-alive` block before it checks for the RC file. It is calling the correct `squeue -j ${jobid}` (as discussed in the [doc: Slurm config](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/SLURM/).
