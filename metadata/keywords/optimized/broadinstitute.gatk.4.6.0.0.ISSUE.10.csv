Integrability,"@magicDGS I think the context for this issue is the Pathogen sequence detection tools, which are Spark tools. `CountingReadFilter` isn't inherently reducible, and shouldn't be used in a Spark tool. Also, I can't say love the idea of using a filter as a control flow mechanism; but I don't have a better idea (maybe a separate tool as @mwalker174 mentioned above ?). One other note. As things currently stand, wrapping a WellFormedReadFilter in a counting filter (which we currently do for walkers) wouldn't give summary counts at the granular level, because WellFormedReadFilter is composed from non-CountingRead filters. Wrapping it yields a single, outer level summary/count.

The GATK supercategory map ""truth"" should be defined by GATK.; - I'm reluctant to make the GATK `getSuperCategoryMap` public, because I don't think it can have any kind of useful contract. Its tied to the GATK doc templates and doc process, which we need to be able to change freely.

We can then copy that on to the docker image, and pip-install it from the copy.

Integrability,"@mbabadi commented on [Thu May 18 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/1064). At the moment, the maximum copy number in gCNV is set by the dimension provided transition matrices. One needs to work with copy number states up to 10 ~ 20 in order to capture high copy number states seen in certain regions. It is desirable to limit the number of states, however, to designate a special state that represents _all copy number states at and above CN_max_. This can be achieved by adjusting the emission probability to integrate over all higher copy number states. There are other challenges too (e.g. calculating copy number posteriors from such states).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3001:538,integrat,integrate,538,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3001,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Integrability,"@meganshand There is a warning in the docs for `ReadCoordinateComparator` that it should not be used for bam file output that needs to match the ordering of `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` exactly, since it sorts all unmapped reads after all mapped reads. `ReadCoordinateComparator` is a comparator for `GATKRead`, and that interface does not allow unmapped reads to have a position. Ie., even if an unmapped `SAMRecord` is assigned the position of its mapped mate, calling `getContig()`/`getStart()` on the unmapped read via the `GATKRead` interface will return null/0. This was done mainly for consistency reasons and to simplify client code. Whenever we need bam file order for reads in GATK4, we operate on SAMRecords directly and use either the `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` from htsjdk or the `HeaderlessSAMRecordCoordinateComparator` (for headerless Spark reads) that produces the same ordering. I recommend addressing this for this tool via `presorted = false` for now, since the GATK3 version has it set to false as well with the comment: ""**we don't want to assume that reads will be written in order by the manager because in deep, deep pileups it won't work**"". This suggests that even if you were to change the comparator used by this tool to behave like `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator`, you'd still have ordering issues in deep coverage areas. It's worthwhile, though, to open a separate ticket to explore whether `ReadCoordinateComparator` could be changed to exactly match bam file order. Eg., perhaps we could add `getAssignedContig()`, `getAssignedStart()`, etc. methods to `GATKRead` to expose the positions that unmapped reads with mapped mates get assigned for sorting purposes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1853#issuecomment-224668518:324,interface,interface,324,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1853#issuecomment-224668518,2,['interface'],['interface']

At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker).

Integrability,"@samuelklee The module can now save and load everything, including the state of the optimizer. This allows to making interesting inference pipelines. Here's a decent strategy for obtaining the global optimum (it works flawlessly on simulated data every time):. - In the first pass, one disables annealing and obtains the variational parameters in a thermal state. The temperature needs to be _high enough_ to allow most/all local minima to merge, though, not too high to allow copy numbers to travel too far away from baseline copy numbers. If this occurs, one must anneal very slowly in the next stage (see below). The results are checkpointed once converged. - In the second pass, one makes another call to the CLI tool, this time w/ annealing enabled (starting from the same temperature) and starting from the checkpointed thermal results (model params, posteriors, adam(ax) state). The annealing rate must be slow enough to prevent thermal fluctuations from getting quenched (i.e. the evolution must be quasi-isothermal). One must look for a steady and linear rise of ELBO, such that when the annealing protocol ends, SNR quickly drops to values below 1. In both runs, the learning rate must be very small (in the rate 0.01-0.05) such that we wouldn't have to worry about controlling stochastic noise. Adam(ax) quickly adjusts its moment estimates and compensates for the small learning rate, so this doesn't increase the training time significantly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020:1107,protocol,protocol,1107,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

Integrability,"@samuelklee: @LeeTL1220 and I just had a discussion about the writer aspect of this branch, and we agreed on the following:. 1. Lee will introduce a new header type to encapsulate the information that's currently passed in individually to the `writeHeader()` method in `AnnotatedIntervalWriter`. This makes the interface cleaner and more future-proof, since the signature will just become `writeHeader(AnnotatedIntervalHeader)`. 2. Lee will start writing out 3 additional structured header lines (as comment lines) to every header, declaring the names of the chrom, start, and stop columns. These will not be respected on input yet (he will still be relying on a config file to get the names of these 3 columns), but it's the first step in the direction of storing all necessary schema information in the header of each file, rather than separately from each file. 3. Lee will file a github issue to eventually use these 3 header lines on input, when they are present, to get the names of the chrom/start/stop columns (possibly still with a fallback to a separate config file if they aren't, but that is a point we can debate in a future PR).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4276#issuecomment-369709447:311,interface,interface,311,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4276#issuecomment-369709447,1,['interface'],['interface']

You need to use a CSI index for references that large but we don't support writing those. (Reading them is weird, I think we can read BAM csi indexes but not VCF ones). . It might be possible to work around this issue by setting `--create-output-variant-index false`, although downstream gatk tools would need an index if you're sharding them. Otherwise I recommend splitting your chromosomes into two separate parts and calling on the split chromosomes.

Integrability,"@stefandiederich, I think this is a problem with how your BED file is being interpreted. In general, with GATK, it's best to use 1-based coordinates intervals, e.g. that of a [Picard-style interval_list](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/1319/collected-faqs-about-interval-lists). BED is 0-based. See https://www.biostars.org/p/84686/ for a clear illustration of the differences. . If provided a BED file, i.e. an intervals list with `.bed` extension, GATK will convert it to the expected 1-based format. So, if `chr2 29430911 29430911` is 0-based BED, then conversion to 1-based would yield `chr2 29430912 29430911`, making the stop less than the start as the error message says. . It seems though that your intervals are actually already 1-based, not 0-based (which the BED format implies).

Integrability,"@t-ogasawara @frank-y-liu @gspowley @paolonarvaez @droazen @lbergelson please comment on the following proposal. The proposal is that we would spin off native PairHMM as a separate project/repo on github and host AVX code there and have alternative implementations extend that project/repo (by creating repos that depend on the AVX one). . In other words, now we have 1 repo, broadinstitute/gatk. After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one). The avx and ppc repos will have their own build systems and unit tests against the new interface.

Integrability,"@tomwhite On the GATK side, I think the steps are:; 1. Rev our Hadoop-BAM dependency once https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/pull/49 is in.; 2. Take one of our existing test inputs and create a copy of it sorted by query name using the hellbender tool `SortSam`. I think a good file to use would be `src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/BQSR/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.ch20.1m-1m1k.NA12878.noMD.noBQSR.bam`, as that file hasn't had either MD or BQSR run on it, and it's the primary input in the `ReadsPipelineSparkIntegrationTest`.; 3. Before making any actual changes to MarkDuplicatesSpark, write a new integration test proving that MarkDuplicatesSpark can read in the queryname-sorted bam above, and produces the same result as when run on the coordinate-sorted version of the bam. The output in both cases when running with `--shardedOutput false` should be a coordinate-sorted bam.; 4. Now the potentially tricky part: in `MarkDuplicatesSpark`, we want to detect queryname-sorted reads using the `SAMFileHeader` SO attribute (`SAMFileHeader.getSortOrder()`), and if we have them, avoid performing the first `groupByKey()` operation in `MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.transformReads()`, instead relying on the natural ordering of the reads to create the `PairedEnds` objects.; 5.

One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?).

I've already done this in a branch.; 2) Change GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy tools to accept paths.; 3) If an index is present for each count path, create a FeatureDataSource, merge the requested -L/-XL intervals, and query to perform the subset. We will also need to stream the SAM header metadata. It should not require much code to extract all this to a temporary IndexedSimpleCountCollection class. (Caveat: for now, this will work with the current gCNV convention of providing bins via -L/-XL. Technically, it will also work with the more conventional use of -L/-XL to denote contiguous regions, but we may have to perform checks that bins are not duplicated in adjacent shards if they overlap both, since querying a FeatureDataSource will return any bins that overlap the interval---rather than only those that are completely contained within it.); 4) Index read-count TSVs in the gCNV WGS pipeline after collection and modify the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and GermlineCNVCaller tasks to take read-count paths and indices, if necessary. These changes could be confined in the gCNV WGS WDL for now. I think that should do the trick. If this is high priority, I can implement now.

Depending on the source it would appear that each arena will allocate either 64MB or 128MB of virtual memory (i.e. address space). So it would probably also be fine to set this limit a bit higher. Secondly, while there's lots of discussion online that setting this doesn't negatively impact Java code running on the JVM, it is possible that native code invoked using JNI could see a modest reduction in performance _if_ a) it's highly multithreaded and b) it's doing lots of heap allocations.

Integrability,"A few points:; 1. When we wrote the Java interface, the 'agreement' was that the sample names would be unique and consistent within the VCF headers. Hence, the assert statement in the Java code.; 1. Having said that, the sample name in the VCF header is ignored completely if checks are disabled (which are disabled by default). This includes the assert statement and a couple of other checks in the importer code. The sample name is taken from the name to reader map provided in the constructor call. This map is created from the tab delimited file.; 1. Would it be possible to provide a simple test case to replicate the bug? I couldn't replicate it. Here is what I did.; 1. Three VCF files - t0.vcf.gz, t1.vcf.gz, t0_dup.vcf.gz. t0 and t0_dup are identical except for the GT field in one location.

One possible solution is that we might want to only create evidence intervals around the proposed breakpoints of the interval, based on adding some amount of slop around each breakpoint (since these inputs are from read-depth based CNV callers that won't be able to identify the breakpoint with single-nucleotide precision). It might take some analysis of the input parameters to figure out the right parameters for this type of approach, which we could do in a subsequent task if you want.

Integrability,"A quick look at the code results in the following finding:. The error message : `""SA-BWT inconsistency: seq_len is not the same.""` is generated in function `bwt_restore_sa()` defined in `bwt.c`, and resulted in an `abort()` call.; `bwt_restore_sa()` itself was called in `bwa_idx_load_bwt()` defined in `bwa.c`, when trying to restore the suffix array from a file with extension "".sa"". This function call is issued when bwa mem (in its main) tries to load the reference information. This happens before input are read. Because of the `abort()` call, letting the `BwaMem` class handle the error is difficult, so I would propose two possible solutions:; 1. changing the behavior of `BwaIndex` class, so that it eagerly loads the reference, and throws an `Java.lang.IOException` when this error is encountered. Of course this must lead to code duplication, i.e. copying a large part of index loading code from bwa itself and walk around`abort()`ing.; 2. ask @lh3 to change the behavior so that it will not `abort()` any more, but return a null pointer.

Integrability,"A quick patch to help out the Variants team, which is struggling with a problematic callset. Note that a similar regularization to the effective number per component probably should have been applied to solve the issue in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6425. I'm not sure if the lack of this regularization will still lead to convergence issues, but I would hope that the fix that was implemented instead (treating vanishing components as a special case and skipping computation) suffices. As discussed there, we may also want to eventually remove the idiosyncratic finalize step; it’s likely this is the source of issues here, since the correct Bayesian M step is already regularized by the prior. The covariance regularization term added here is standard (c.f. e.g. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e1e6d09bcc2eaeba98f7e737aac2ac782f0e5f1/sklearn/mixture/_gaussian_mixture.py#L154), but it may result in non-negligible changes to VQSLODs. As just discussed with the Variants team, we can probably use the WARP validation to convince ourselves that results are functionally equivalent. I updated the exact-match tests without much close examination (by simply forcing IntegrationTestSpec.assertEqualTextFiles to overwrite the old expected files), so someone may want to sanity check them.

In addition, they have some suggestions for features for DiagnoseTargets. I've recapitulated their post below:. ---. This is a GATK3 issue, but I hope that GATK4 will incorporate the following suggestion. And while we are on the subject, what is the roadmap for FindCoveredIntervals, DiagnoseTargets, and DepthOfCoverage (or something even more awesome) in GATK4?. A common pattern is to use `FindCoveredIntervals --uncovered` to create an interval list that serves as input to `DiagnoseTargets`. On a good day, FindCoveredIntervals --uncovered might create an interval list file that is empty, i.e., all the tested intervals were covered well enough by the given criteria.

If you want to run whole genome, use -T DepthOfCoverage instead.; ```; and exit with a non-zero return code. It is certainly possible to trap the empty interval list and skip DiagnoseTargets, but it I think it would be better if DiagnoseTargets emitted the warning but then quit with empty output and a zero rc.

Integrability,"A user on the GATK Forum submitted a request to make the INFO field easier to manipulate through creating a table. At the GATK Office Hours meeting 11/8, we discussed the two ideas and favored the first idea to make a new tool, similar to VariantsToTable, that would unpack the INFO field. This request was created from a contribution made by Shahryar Alavi on October 30, 2020 19:54 UTC. Link: [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360073983291-VariantsToTable-not-extracting-INFO-sub-fields-#community\_comment\_360013343072](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360073983291-VariantsToTable-not-extracting-INFO-sub-fields-#community_comment_360013343072). \--. But MAF output is somewhat different from VCF; and I think the VCF output format is better for germline variant annotation. With Funcotator we get an integrated (and minuter) ""variant calling - annotation"" workflow. But the problem is ""vertical bar"" separated INFOs are not easy for downstream text processing. I have two suggestions for the GATK Team:. You may want to develop a new tool (like VariantsToTable) to separate each ""sub-info"" in the FUNCOTATION INFO, and put them into separate columns with corresponding headers when creating the tab-delimited table. Or add a feature to Funcotator to create multiple INFOs with FUNCOTATION prefix in their IDs; e.g. #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION\\\_Gencode\\\_34\\\_hugoSymbol,...> ; ; #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION\\\_Gencode\\\_34\\\_ncbiBuild,...>. instead of. #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION,...,Description=""Funcotation fields are: Gencode\\\_34\\\_hugoSymbol|Gencode\\\_34\\\_ncbiBuild|..."">.

Integrability,"Actually, I guess the global random generator is never reset in production code. This is probably fine and will result in overall deterministic behavior, but you can imagine instances in which changing the behavior or order of successive modules that use the generator could lead to debugging headaches. In CNV code (notably, the MCMC/sampling utilities and KernelSegmenter), classes either instantiate or reset private generators when appropriate or their methods take a generator as a parameter.

Integrability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630. In fact, I think the original idea was that Lee's validation would be the first to go into CARROT. Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Integrability,"Adding in the option for using a compressed representation of our reference data. The flag use_compressed_references needs to be passed into ingest and also export, and doing so causes us to use a different internal schema for the ref_ranges table that can save ~40% on space. On the VCF path, the packed data is expanded while we populate the prepare tables before extract. On the VDS path, the packed data is expanded while we extract from the tables to create the Avro files. I updated integration tests to take use_compressed_refs as an option, and saw what I needed. Integrations tests for the VCF and VDS paths go to completion and fail, but in the expected way. AssertIdenticalOutputs, the important part, passes. AssertTableSizesAreExpected fails because the ref_ranges table is so much smaller (255884464 vs 431805033 expected) and AssertCostIsTrackedAndExpected fails because the PrepareRangesCallsetTask.GvsPrepareRanges.BigQuery Query Scanned is similarly smaller (340787200 vs 515899392). Given the nature of the change and the fact that it is an optional flag that defaults to zero, updating the integration tests to cover this path did not seem sound at this time.

Integrability,"Adds a new ReadWalker tool, `RealignSoftClippedReads`, that realigns soft-clipped fragments using BWA. This tool is motivated by a specific artifact produced by Illumina DRAGEN v3.7.8 in which reads containing small indels are erroneously soft-clipped, often within mobile element contexts (LINE, SINE, ALU, SVA, etc). This is particularly problematic for mobile element insertion callers such as [Scramble](https://github.com/GeneDx/scramble) that rely on soft-clips for identifying potential insertion sites but do not perform a local assembly. In some cases, these soft-clipped reads are aligned to the incorrect region (confirmed by BLAT query and comparison to BWA alignments).

Integrability,"After experimenting with this a bit, I think using failOnVersionConflict is too inflexible. Currently, we're silently picking up newer versions of dependencies because we're relying on Gradle's default resolution strategy. But if we switch to using failOnVersionConflict, we'll have to resolve each conflict manually, and then we'll have the opposite problem: we'll silently remain pinned to older versions. I think what we really want is to fix the ""silent"" part, so that we have a mechanism that notifies us when we've introduced a change that results in a change to transitive dependency resolution, and gives us a record of which commits caused the change, without necessarily requiring us to manually pin the dependency to a particular version. I propose that we add a file to the repo containing the output of the ""dependencies"" task, and also add a Gradle task that compares that file with the current ""dependencies"" output. Anytime dependencies change, the task/build will fail, and the file diff will tell us what transitive dependencies changed. We can then choose how to resolve the change; either by force resolution, or by just updating the file. The file would have to be updated every time our explicit dependencies change, but the file history would give us a record of which commits changed transitive dependencies.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2592#issuecomment-300280478:147,depend,dependencies,147,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2592#issuecomment-300280478,9,['depend'],"['dependencies', 'dependency']"

We still need some way to stub, because there are places deep in the code that call RefApiSource.getInstance(). We could have a getDataflowInstance() and a getSparkInstance() - the former would normally return the code formerly known as RefApiSource, except if tests set up the mock. getSparkInstance can return always the same thing apparently since you didn't see a need for a mock - but this way if we need it later, at least the code follows the same pattern.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086:40,wrap,wrapping,40,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086,6,"['depend', 'interface', 'rout', 'wrap']","['depending', 'interface', 'route', 'wrapping']"

If that tools are treated in a different way, then it requires even more work - Barclay does not use the omitFromCommandLine at all, and that means that GATK should extend the bash-completion to take it into account.; * If a tool can bash-complete but it does not show in the online help pages (the main source for help, taking into account that in the CLI is a bit messy when the parameter space grows), then it will be really difficult to really understand how the tool work. Even if it shows the parameters with tab-tab, the only way of checking what the meaning of each of them is look at the CLI help.

Integrability,"As determined by @davidadamsphd , the `Copyable` interface idea won't work:. The recommendation from the Dataflow team was to make a narrow API and do the copying part of the API. I started down this route, and I think it might be doable for things like the walker interface. The idea is to make a Copyable interface and have our interfaces extend that. . However, we have unsafe code already in the engine. I tried to make this SafeDoFn approach, however it became clear quickly that we'd have a combinatorial explosion of classes because we don't just have `DoFn<GATKRead,POut>`, but also `<Iterable<GATKRead>,POut>`, and many others. So, this approach will not work for the engine. I then tried to make a general purpose solution (using coders to write to bytes and then recreate a new class). This doesn't work for a few reasons, most critical is that the coder registry isn't Serializable, so that can't be passed down deep enough to get this to work. While working on this, I chatted with someone on the Dataflow team who is working on the verification on the direct runner. He has a PR out and likely going to get it approved soon. So, for the engine, we could always test using the direct runner and know for sure there are not issues (once we can use his code). However, there are two downsides:. 1) We will need to wait for a cut of the SDK (which looking at their previous clip is likely ~ two weeks away). . 2) I don't know if we want the direct runner test as our general purpose solution. Can we expect Comp Bios to always test with the direct runner first?

Integrability,"Base qualities of two (`#`) are handled specially by BWA and our tools and are typically used to indicate adapter sequence. See reply to jhess in <https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/comment/35120#Comment_35120>:. > That's correct, Q2 bases are considered to be special and left untouched by BQSR. Currently, there is no easy way to convert base qualities to two. The only instances I am aware of is (i) for SamToFastq, which then unaligns the reads and (ii) MergeBamAlignment, which isn't necessarily a part of everyone's workflow. Also, MergeBamAlignment's `CLIP_ADAPTERS` softclips XT tagged sequence, which then becomes fair game for our assembly-based callers. MarkIlluminaAdapters uses aligned reads to mark those with 3' adapter sequence with the XT tag. The XT tag values note the start of the 3' adapter sequence in the read. During MergeBamAlignment, one must especially request that this XT tag is retained in the merged output. Because our assembly-based callers throw out CIGAR strings from the aligner when reassembling reads, so as to use soft-clipped sequence that may contain true variants we wish to resolve, adapter sequence can be incorporated into the graph. This is not an issue for libraries with low levels of adapter read through and for germline calling as we prune nodes in the graph that have less than two reads supporting it. . However, for somatic cases and for libraries where there is considerable adapter read through, the current solution is to hard-clip adapter sequences out of reads or to toss these reads altogether so as not to increase the extent of spurious calls. The issue with hard-clipping is that our reads become malformed due to a mismatch in CIGAR string and sequence length. These the GATK engine filters. So the solution is to either correct the CIGAR strings or to go back and re-align the clipped reads or again to toss the reads. It would be great not to have to throw out reads that include some adapter sequence in somatic wor",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3540:106,adapter,adapter,106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3540,3,['adapter'],['adapter']

Also note that I've retained original sklearn comments throughout the implementation and have also commented on mathematical expressions where it might be helpful.; - [x] Unit tests. There's already test data (generated using Pyro) checked in and the results match the sklearn implementation to high precision, I just need to write numerical checks. There are also already unit tests for static utility methods. Future work:; - [ ] Expanding unit tests to cover more of the interface.

Integrability,Bug on 4.0.0.0 reported on forum -- please advise how to proceed @droazen @lbergelson. ---. Ok now things are getting more interesting. Disabling intelflaters seems to solve the problem. But why?. Same flaters work with standalone picard as well and they don't have any issues. Compression level does not change anything. Is this a memory allocation error? I don't think so because it does not segfault. The error message says filename not found. . I am wondering if this has anything to do with meltdown patches. Both of my systems (Ubuntu and macOS) are patched against meltdown bug. And Intel flaters are causing this issue. But this won't explain why standalone picard is still working fine with them. The only explanation that I have is the difference between HTSJDK and GKL versions between standalone picard 2.17.2 and embedded picard 2.17.2 in gatk. The latest HTSJDK update for standalone picard mentions 2.13.1 version but the one in gatk 4.0 is 2.13.2 I believe. I don't have the info about GKL version used in them. .

They **should** degrade to java implementations automatically though. . IBM has a fork that works on power8 which reimplements some of the optimizations for PairHMM, so it's definitely possible to implement the various native optimizations for other architectures although not a small project. .

Integrability,"By modifying the test I was able to isolate the error in the `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils` package, which is strange because the PR did not modify the javadoc for any class in that package. The integration test runs `com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute` and asserts that the output code is zero, which does not yield a useful error message. In order to produce something more meaningful I hacked the test to output the entire `stdout` and `stderr` as follows:. ```; final StringWriter out = new StringWriter();; final PrintWriter err = new PrintWriter(out);. final int result = com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute(""program"", err, err, err, ""doclet"",docArgList.toArray(new String[] {}));; err.flush(); // probably not needed; String message = out.toString(); // message contains the entire stdout and stderr of the call to execute; Assert.assertEquals(result, 0, message);; ```.

Integrability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum.

Integrability,"Closes #7884. The bug was caused by two position-only checks that should have been contig+position checks. I added a minimal regression test that uses a 2-record snippet of the test data discussed in the first post of the issue. Also discussed there is expected behavior that this fix does not induce. It seems the expectation is that a QUAL = 0 variant block should be turned into a GQ0 reference block. However, I wonder if this is not actually representative of the current (pre-fix) behavior of the tool. For example, if the test data is run only over chr13 using master, the position is not dropped (since then the position-only checks are valid). In that case, we do not see a GQ0 reference block; we instead see a GQ40 reference block, since the original record had GQ61. With the fix, we reproduce this reference block. So although we do not induce the expected GQ0 behavior, I would say the bug is fixed. Whether or not we should issue an additional fix to induce the expected GQ0 behavior is another question entirely. I'm not completely sure what the expected behavior should be from the tool or code documentation alone. Someone more familiar with this tool (@droazen perhaps you can suggest?) may have to chime in. They should probably also check that the contig+position checks are all that need to be added to address the original bug; I'm not 100% sure about behavior there either, but at least all other integration tests seem to still pass.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8028:1421,integrat,integration,1421,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8028,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"Copying in some discussion about my initial, incorrect, effort in PR #2547:. David Roazen:; As discussed in person, we fully support the mission of making this class less stateful (and particularly making it so that `isVcCoveredByDeletion()` does not modify state, which was the original ticket), but we're concerned that this method `calculateOutputAlleleSubset()` was intended to be stateful, and to accumulate deletions across calls. It's also not well covered by tests, so this change could easily break the method. Can you think about this issue and reply here once you've looked into it, davidbenjamin ? Also at-mentioning ronlevine to solicit his comments, since he appears to have added `upstreamDeletionsLoc` to this class in the first place. Ron Levine; droazen Is correct. It was intended to maintain state for upstream deletions. Make sure the upstream spanning deletion does not span shard barriers, then there will be problems with the book keeping.

For example, using this SRA sample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR12324251 and mapping the reads against these references using minimap2: https://s3.amazonaws.com/zymo-files/BioPool/ZymoBIOMICS.STD.refseq.v2.zip, and then observing the alignments that appear at position 97201 on the main E.

Applying the above filters to these alignments reports 871 alignments. However, GATK HaplotypeCaller reports only 743 valid alignments (before variant calling).

I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349:931,integrat,integrating,931,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Integrability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome).

Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet.

Integrability,"First of all, thank you so much for your hard work! I am excited to explore GATK 4.0.0.0.; I would like to report minor issues in setting up optional dependencies for GATK4. First, `gatkcondaenv.yml` defines `gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip` location as; `build/gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip`; The path doesn't seem to work seamlessly with the release archive, though the path makes sense in the root directory of source repo. Unzipping the package file locates both files in the same directory and, to me, it is natural to create the conda environment in the directory. Second, it would be more convenient to include `install_R_packages.R` in the release like gatkcondaenv.yml for python dependencies. Also, I had an issue running `install_R_packages.R` for fresh compiled R-3.2.5. The way `install_R_packages.R` install `optparse` prevents its dependency (the getopt package) from being automatically installed, because (I guess) repos argument is set to NULL. I think the helper script needs to install the getopt package as well.; ```; optparseUrl=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/optparse/optparse_1.3.2.tar.gz""; if (!(""optparse"" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {; install.packages(optparseUrl, repos=NULL, type=""source""); }; ```. Finally, it would be convenient to depend on a R version available in conda, so that R dependency can be a part of the gatk conda environment. I wasn't able to get the recommended R-3.2.5 from conda.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209:150,depend,dependencies,150,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209,5,['depend'],"['depend', 'dependencies', 'dependency']"

Integrability,"Fixes a bug that I inadvertently introduced long ago in #5408. A method there originally assumed that the intervals to be filtered coincide with the annotated intervals when filtering on annotations, but this assumption can be violated when e.g. using `-XL` to further exclude intervals. This breaks the annotation-based filtering and will result in incorrectly retained/dropped intervals. Unfortunately, the integration test cases were not quite complete enough to catch this. Fortunately, for typical data and parameters, the number of affected intervals is typically a very small percentage, especially in human (e.g., the default GC filters of [0.1, 0.9] affect <0.1% of 250bp bins); I only caught this when running on malaria data, since GC filtering has more impact there. I would also expect count-based filters to mitigate some of the effects (e.g., a bin with extreme GC that was erroneously retained when filtering on annotations might later be filtered because it has poor coverage). Downstream results are also all correct---they're just given for a slightly different set of intervals than would be expected. This bug would affect users that made use of the `blacklist_intervals_for_filter_intervals` option in the gCNV WDLs, but my feeling is this functionality is not used that frequently. @droazen I think this is a relatively minor bug, but it might be good to mention it in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046:409,integrat,integration,409,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Because I have a tool that adds read groups with the possibility of splitting in a similar way as `SplitReads` I would like to integrate these parameters in the same tool and I can't with the current implementation. I propose to change the `SplitReads` names to a camel case format different from Picard and pointing out that they are related with splitting.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2383:133,integrat,integrate,133,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2383,2,['integrat'],['integrate']

Integrability,GATK exposes Picard tools thru its command line interface. The usage syntax is different between these two tool kits and so picard code examples in javadocs don't make that much sense when displayed in GATK's own docs. For now code examples embeded in the Picard repo should stick to picard syntax as a matter of principle. So the solution is to transform those snippets on-the-fly when we generate the gatk-docs. . The is a good opportunity to do so in ```GATKHelpDocWorkUnitHandler``` by overloading the ```getDescription(DocWorkUnit)``` so that any occurrence of a picard.jar example is translated into gatk's version:; ```. <pre>java -jar picard.jar toolName \; ARG1=VAL1 \; ARG2=VAL2 ; </pre>; ```. to this:. ```; <pre>gatk toolName \; -ARG1 VAL1 \; --ARG2 VAL2; </pre>; ```.

This is a richer and more flexible approach to working with reads data. It allows you to keep your genomics data in a common BAM file format on Google Cloud Storage and work with it efficiently from your computation pipelines, using standard bioinformatics tools. We have already launched our own open source implementation of this protocol, which you can use to access your reads data. Many popular tools such as samtools and htslib have been updated by the community to support htsget. Documentation is provided here.

To save time and effort, we created Variant Transforms, an open source tool for directly importing VCF data into BigQuery. Variant Transforms and its documentation are published here.

Integrability,"Hello - in GATK3 we wrote a variety of custom VariantAnnotation classes, and created a GATK3 fork / custom JAR with those classes. We run VariantAnnotator using that. I am hoping you might comment on whether this plan seems reasonable:. I am going to try to implement this in our DISCVRseq package, which is a standalone package that depends on GATK4. I am currently expecting that I would need to be a separate tool, like ""VariantAnnotationExtended"" in our code. My tool can make an instance of VariantAnnotatorEngine, passing whatever annotationList I see fit. It seems like I will either be able to use GATKTool.makeVariantAnnotations() as-is, or override it to search custom classpaths (not currently clear if that's needed). In the end, my new tool should be able to function like core GATK4 VariantAnnotator, picking up your core annotations and whatever new ones I make. The latter is useful so I dont need to execute two annotation commands if I want to use a combination of annotations. .

Integrability,"Hello @freeseek. It should be noted that you might be somewhat confused about what the -SO arguments do in the tools:; `-SORT_ORDER ""unsorted""` which has the help description `""The order in which the merged reads should be output. Default value: coordinate. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate, unknown}.""` For MergeBamAlignment that argument doesn't change how the input sort order is treated but rather is used to determine whether the tool will resort your reads before outputting them. Currently it looks like MergeBamAlignment requires queryname sorted inputs: `""Original SAM or BAM file of unmapped reads, which must be in queryname order. Reads MUST be unmapped.""` and will crash with the unhelpful message you encountered. It may be possible to loosen this restriction to queryname-grouped inputs (since it really primarily needs the mates adjacent to each other but not necessarily in readname order). The place to have this discussion would be here https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard since this tool is a picard tool that is called into by GATK and any changes would need to be approved by the maintainers of that repo..

Integrability,Hello @lindenb. . I think I found what is going on here and its a bug on our part that we didn't provide a better error for this issue. In the bed file you uploaded this is the offending interval:; `GL000223.1 178912 180554`; Unfortunately this is the length of that interval in the hg37 decoy sequence dictionary is as follows:; `@SQ SN:GL000223.1 LN:180455`; So it seems the issue here is that something got mangled and you are requesting a bad interval. It turns out we were using a codepath that failed to check that the interval was valid when specified as a bed file and active region padding code was using the correct interval based on the dictionary. This should be an easy fix on your end. I am making a branch that should trigger a better check and error message.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960:766,message,message,766,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960,1,['message'],['message']

Given the fact I'm providing the same file as the BAITS_INTERVALS and TARGETS_INTERVALS, I'd expect the PCT_OFF_BAIT and PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET to be the same, but then I [read here](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7442/collecthsmetrics) that the ON_BAIT_BASES and ON_TARGET_BASES may actually differ due to the fact one relies on the NEAR_DISTANCE argument (that only applies on the ON_BAIT_BASES) and other depends on some read filters (MINIMUM_BASE_QUALITY and MINIMUM_MAPPING_QUALITY that may apply to ON_TARGET_BASES, didn't find any documention on that). Indeed, I observed the described differences in the ON_BAIT_BASES/ON_TARGET_BASES metrics:. > ON_BAIT_BASES 1733719583; ON_TARGET_BASES 1274990601. which was reflected in the PCT_SELECTED_BASES (Fraction of bases from reads passing the filters located on or near a baited region):; > PCT_SELECTED_BASES 0.690911. Then, for the PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET (Fraction of aligned bases that were filtered out because they did not align over a target base.) I got:; >PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET 0.731878. which doesn't make sense to be so high. Shouldn't this value be close to the result of (`1-PCT_SELECTED_BASES`) , given that the BAITS and TARGETS intervals file is the same ?.

This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not).

I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs.

Integrability,"Hi @Nehir291, please refer to the SVAnnotate tool documentation for definitions of each annotation: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/21905053774363-SVAnnotate. For translocations, PREDICTED_LOF is assigned if a breakpoint falls at any point in the transcript, so an intronic breakpoint would still be annotated as PREDICTED_LOF for any impacted genes. This is because only part of the gene exists on each chromosome after the translocation, which is likely to result in a truncated transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. . Perhaps in some cases this definition is overly permissive, such as if only the UTR or one shorter exon is removed by the translocation - those cases could be worth revisiting. . I hope this helps explain the behavior you are seeing. If this does not fully explain all the PREDICTED_LOF annotations you are observing, please share the CTX breakpoints, the annotations, the SVAnnotate version, and the GTF used so we can investigate further.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147:530,mediat,mediated,530,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147,1,['mediat'],['mediated']
Integrability,"Hi @Vzzarr ,. Thank you for reporting this. I've never heard of this happening before, but I suspect the difference is that you are using maven and we've only ever used gradle. @magicDGS @LeeTL1220 You both build downstream projects, have you ever seen this?. From what I can tell `com.github.fommil.netlib.all` is a POM only dependency, but it's not annotated as such in our generated POM. Gradle resolves it correctly, and then resolves it's transitive dependencies correctly, but maven seems to resolve it differently. . I've reproduced the issue locally, and it seems like it can be fixed by changing this line in our build file:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/62e339fb9150db19f80d4b48aed8d47608461690/build.gradle#L220. to specify the exact dependencies we want instead of using the all artifact. I'll open a pull request with that. There's an additional catch though, you're using the latest release to maven central, which is actually a very old version. We haven't been able to release newer versions to central because they depend on a snapshot of a fork of a google library that isn't released to central. We publish these to our artifactory server which can be resolved like any other maven repository. Would you be able to work with an artifactory dependency? If you can you can A) use the newer and better gatk, B) I won't have to backport this change on top of beta.2 . We're going to fix the problem of not being in central eventually ( certainly before 4.0 release... ) but until then resolving from our artifactory is probably the best bet.

Integrability,"Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. . After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. . If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. . David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

There's a [recent patch](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/f7dea3c08b126c56b851c4d381cfdb5513e0584f) which makes it so that should happen much less but it's not in any currently released version. Are you able to build the current master branch of gatk and repeat your test with that version? I suspect it will clarify what's going on.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8232#issuecomment-1452177739:40,message,message,40,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8232#issuecomment-1452177739,1,['message'],['message']
Integrability,"Hi @droazen , thanks for your quick response! Depending on what you mean for ""multiple tools,"" I'd say just Mutect2. I say this because we are running this as part of a cwl workflow, so Mutect2 is running on its own instance (virtual machine) with that specified docker image. All of the surrounding tools have produced the expected outputs when queried except for Mutect2. That's a good point about the release version, I think we happen to be considering upgrading, but have to be picky as to when given the size and scope of our operation :) Also, your suggestion of using the official GATK might help, as I am not sure I can rule out subtle `apt update` changes even within the same version of ubuntu over time.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7269#issuecomment-847248241:46,Depend,Depending,46,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7269#issuecomment-847248241,1,['Depend'],['Depending']

Integrability,"Hi @hh1985 . Memory tuning is pretty tricky and can depend on a lot of things. How is your cluster configured? ; Are you using YARN? Are you running in client or cluster mode? . I'm assuming you're running with YARN. Mesos should also work but I don't have any experience configuring it. . BQSR should run safely with 4g of memory per core. (It should really work with much less I think, but 4 should definitely be sufficient.) There are a few different parameters that can help you adjust the memory ratios.; A good tuning might be something like; ; ```; --num-executors 5 ; --executor-cores 8 ; --executor-memory 32g ; ```. if you're not running with gatk-launch you'll need to set; ```; --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=600; ```; Without setting a higher than default yarn memory overhead like this we see consistent crashes, it's included in the settings gatk-launch applies already. That should run 5 separate executors with 8 cores each and give each one 32g, so 4g / core. . If you're running in cluster mode you'll have to carve out some memory and cores for the driver. You can set the driver settings with ; ```; --driver-cores 2; --driver-memory 4g; ``` ; or something along those lines. The driver doesn't need much memory or computer for BQSR. In general we've had better luck using the entire cluster for one job and running jobs in sequence rather than trying to run two jobs simultaneously using a subset of the cluster.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3465#issuecomment-324064738:52,depend,depend,52,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3465#issuecomment-324064738,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that.

Its an oversight in our logging that causes that error message and it should not mean that your execution of SplitNCigarReads was invalid.

Integrability,"Hi Christina (@cristinaluengoagullo ),. The GenomicsDBImport in version 4.0.0.0 has a few bugs that you may or may not encounter, but I'd recommend you run GATK 4.0.1.0 or later. That's admittedly a very cryptic error message. We're working on doing a better job wrapping the GenomicsDB errors into readable GATK User Errors. In the meantime, I have a few ideas. Do you have any unusual annotations in that GVCF? The Vidmap takes information from the VCF header annotation descriptions to figure out how to store annotation values after they're parsed. It's complaining that something is wrong with the type of one of your annotations, so my guess is that there's an annotation that's not described correctly in the header. Can you send the gdbworkspace-gatk/vidmap.json file? A snippet of the input GVCF (ideally with the header) would be good too.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4514#issuecomment-371831740:218,message,message,218,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4514#issuecomment-371831740,2,"['message', 'wrap']","['message', 'wrapping']"

Integrability,"Hi Marissa - I think we're all in agreement that we'd like to find a way to make Intel-TF the default, but whether or not we can have CNNScoreVariants require AVX to run is less clear. Naturally, we'd prefer to not have to provide a custom TF distribution for a fallback, but there are 3 cases where we may not have a choice: user with old hardware, Travis/CI testing, and GCE. We may need to provide a fallback environment for those (I'll try to get resolution on that). If it turns out we do, I'm actually not suggesting the fallback be automatic (3 in your list), just that we have a graceful failure mode and an instructive error message. . In the meantime, there is still the issue that this PR fails to even build on Travis. It looks like it produces so much output building the Docker image that it exceeds the allowable Travis build log size. That will need to be resolved, and we'll also need to understand the impact of this change on the size of our Docker image, which is already large, and continues to be a challenge for us.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-429451059:634,message,message,634,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-429451059,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:36,integrat,integrate,36,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,2,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integrate', 'interfaces']"

Integrability,"Hmm, looks like we lose events 1 and 3 with CollectReadCounts at 250bp using analogous ModelSegments parameters. However, I experimented with tweaking the segmentation to work on the copy ratios (rather than the log2 copy ratios), which seems to recover them. Although one of the goals of having evaluations backed by SV truth sets is to tune such parameters/methods, I'm beginning to think that SV integration might benefit from using the CNV tools in a more customized pipeline---especially if maximizing sensitivity at resolutions of ~100bp jointly with breakpoint evidence is the goal. For example, you might imagine a tool that directly uses CNV backend code to collect coverage over regions specified by `-L`, builds a PoN, denoises, and segments on the fly.

I realize you have a lot of existing example that dont need this capability.

I have one or two other lab-specific walkers that would benefit from using the iteration pattern of MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, but also need some ability to retain the FeatureInput->VariantContext link. I believe GATK3 retained this. It would be nice to at least make this a capability available to all MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart walkers.

Integrability,"I did, but then I rethought it and decided that I think it's too fragile to do it that way: You have to guarantee that all classes that might want to be registered are loaded and initialized before you instantiate the SparkConf. The problem is that it varies among JVM implementations exactly when that (class loading and initialization) happens. Some JVMs do the whole mess, chasing all references down from main recursively at the beginning, others are as lazy as possible and initialize only when actually traversing a reference for the first time. We could use that technique to ""inject"" a set of registrations into the GATKRegistrator from each main class. But since it's unreliable to do it in arbitrary classes, it seemed more straightforward to just let the normal object oriented method of overrides handle the problem, since it will need to be done only by direct subclasses, anyway.

So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:679,message,message,679,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"I don't think that hiding/disable arguments would work in every case: sometimes, an argument shouldn't be exposed but still available to set programmatically, or maybe just reduce visibility making it `@Hidden` and/or `@Advance`. What is the problem of making an interface for the top-level argument to the GATK? Changing the interface or the `CommadnLineProgram` has the same effect, but the API user can still behave the same as before. It is much more extensible and downstream-friendly. What's about making the `CLPConfigurationArgumentCollection` an interface always returning defaults to be able to change it in a proper way? The cycle of development of a new argument will be: 1) add a new method to the interface with a default returning what will be expected from the previous behaviour, 2) add and return by the argument in the GATK implementation, 3) use the getter in the CLP for perform the operation. This only adds the first point, and operating in 3 classes instead of 3. For API user it is really easy to maintain the previous behavior when upgrading the dependency by just using their own implementation of the class, or include the top-level new arguments by using the GATK implementation. It is much more flexible and extensible (I always think about GATK also as a library). In addition, I think that this approach is also important for evolving GATK. For example, if a new top-level argument is tagged as experimental (still not supported but requested in Barclay), removing it would allow to keep the interface (no version bump) the same and final users can still operate with the experimental argument. The same applies to the `GATKTool` base class (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341), and for downstream projects the aim should be to be able to extend safely the `CommandLineProgram` directly to implement their own toolkit using the powerful GATK framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003:263,interface,interface,263,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003,6,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependency', 'interface']"

Integrability,"I found some edge cases when implemented a new walker based on GATKTool that should be considered in the base class to avoid some mistakes by developers. They should either being correctly handled or documented as not-applicable for some walkers:. - [ ] If a tool/walker overrides getPluginDescriptors to remove the `GATKReadFilterPluginDescriptor`, the method `makeReadFilter` will not return a filter with the `getDefaultReadFilters`. This is important for implementing tools where the user shouldn't be able to override the filters. I suggest to either handle the case where the plugin cannot be detected and return a filter with only defaults, or to specify in the documentation that `makeReadFilter` should be overriden in that case. - [ ] Transformer methods for reads (`makePreReadFilterTransformer`and `makePostReadFilterTransformer`) only have effect in `ReadWalker`(and extensions). I think that the `ReadsContext` should have a method to set pre/post transformers, and call this methods to integrate with every extension of `GATKTool`. Otherwise, it should be documented that it has no effect in most of the cases. @droazen - could you give me some way to proceed here?

Integrability,"I have to deal with this component recently and I found the design rather awkward.... In general between GATK and htsjdk we don't seem to have a proper support for managing and querying Supplementary alignment information from read alignment records:. 1. Querying: implemented in htsjdk consists in forging artificial SAMRecords that contain only the alignment info in the SA tag element... It seems to me that it makes more sense to create class to hold this information alone (e.g. ReadAlignmentInfo or ReadAlignment); SATagBuilder already has defined a private inner class with that in mind ""SARead"" so why not flesh it out and make it public. 2. Writing: currently SATagBuilder gets attached to a read, parsing its current SA attribute content into SARead instances. It provides the possibility adding additional SAM record one by one or clearing the list. ... then it actually updates the SA attribute on the original read when a method (setTag) is explicitly called.; I don't see the need to attach the SATag Builder to a read... it could perfectly be free standing; the same builder could be re-apply to several reads for that matter and I don't see any gain in hiding the read SA tag setting process,... even if typically this builder output would go to the ""SA"" tag, perhaps at some point we would like to also write SA coordinate list somewhere else, some other tag name or perhaps an error message... why impose this single purpose limitation?; I suggest to drop the notion of a builder for a more general custom ReadAlignmentInfo (or whatever name) list. Such list could be making reference to a dictionary to validate its elements, prevent duplicates, keep the primary SA in the first position... etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324:1401,message,message,1401,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324,1,['message'],['message']

The following are total times as reported by Gradle for serial runs of the VQSR integration tests:. With 1000 base lookahead:; 1m40s; 1m29s; 1m29s; 1m25s. With 100,000 base lookahead:; 1m29s; 1m17s; 1m16s; 1m18s. Back to 1000 base lookahead again:; 1m36s; 1m26s; 1m26s; 1m29s.

Integrability,"I terms of comparing implementations in this particular instance, the entire BAM file is also being scanned, so there is no additional limitation in using Parquet. In general, though, there are some additional complications for typical Hadoop data sets due to their distributed nature.

A few of them:; - Data set partitioning in the style of Hive, where you split your data set into a directory hierarchy that's based on the values of one of the columns. This is like building an index, and should be done on cols that feature in lot of predicates. In the quince repo that we're using for ingest, we are partitioning the data based on genome locus. This makes it easy to access the data only from the locus of interest.; - Parquet supports predicate pushdown and column stats on its row chunks, so the more you homogenize the data (e.g., by sorting), the more likely it is you can skip large blocks of data.; - The parquet file format supports the concept of indexing (though I don't think it is implemented yet in any of the packages that read/write it); - For particular applications, you can also use a different storage backend like HBase or Kudu that allow very rapid point/range queries at scale. I believe GEL is planning on trying out HBase for some of their applications; - The Hammerbacher lab and the ADAM folks are also working on tools for BAM file indexing and visualization that scales on Hadoop.

Integrability,"I think @davidbenjamin is correct, that class does not produce unphased likelihoods but phased one. That is per se not a problem if they are handled appropriatelly down stream. . For example i think the Exact AF calculator does handle them as phased likelihoods. However many if not most of other usages may be wrong, for example the VCF output itself. The spec doesnt say whether the PL are phased or unphased or whether it would depend on whether the GT is phased or unphased itself. . It seems that we have been rather careless all this time as to how we were using those likelihood and we shall revise that. . In practice it only makes a difference with low signal/noise ratio data... perhaps this is the source or a source of bias against het calls if that has been observed in the past. My suggestion is to rename the likelihood emitting methods adding Phased to them and a new Unphased method set delegating on the former applying the corresponding coefficient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235682878:431,depend,depend,431,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235682878,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"I think changes in 4.2.4.1 are exposing an issue, but I think @eriqande is right that the issue isn't with GenomicsDB. The change was that previously GATK wasn't correctly passing the `--max-alternate-allele` argument to GenomicsDB, but now that it is doing so it makes it more likely that some sites don't contain fields like PL (dependent on number of possible genotypes). It looks like the AF calculation used to ignore sites if they didn't have likelihoods, but has now been updated slightly to also allow sites with GQ or sites where any alleles are called+nonref+not symbolic. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/caa48f98c8207b688db6ee35fead3eafb7219e38/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/GenotypeUtils.java#L139-L141. Possibly that condition needs to be tweaked? @ldgauthier might be the best person to ask. As for this working with previous versions, that is only because the `--max-alternate-alleles` wasn't being passed to GenomicsDB correctly. if you want to revert to that behavior you can set `--max-alternate-alleles` to `50` (which is what GenomicsDB defaults to).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941:331,depend,dependent,331,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"I think it's best not to co-opt existing formats for storing *variant calls* and *mutations* if we want to store generic annotations. Furthermore, many of the drawbacks of VCF (e.g, wasted space from repeated tags/unused fields) are really not worth dealing with if our data is strictly tabular and well structured. I think if we can settle on a format internally that satisfies all of our needs, then it'd probably a *very small* amount of effort on the part of external developers to write adapters to consume it. After all, we are only talking about metadata (hopefully in a standardized but suitably flexible format, e.g. SAM/VCF-style header) + tabular data. It may also be that there is a format out there that already fits the bill, in which case we just need to do some more research and discussion.

Integrability,"I tried to do it, and I'm afraid that it won't be trivial as I expected: because it is a facade, there is not accesibility to `Logger.setLogLevel()` and this is required to set the verbosity level in the command line. After explore a bit the code, it seems that [`LoggingUtils`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/LoggingUtils.java) is the only place where a concrete implementation should be used. My suggestion is to move this class to a package that could be excluded by the backend user (because it contains methods to change the logging of log4j, I suggest `org.apache.logging.log4j`), which implements a simple interface/abstract class `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.LoggingUtils` to set the log level (LoggingUtils.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`. The default implementation (that could be used by final users callid`super.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`) could setup the htsjdk and the java.util.logger.Logger. This implementation requires to change the `CommandLineProgram` to have a setter for the `LoggingUtils` to use, that could be set in `Main` (as in my PR for improve the extensibility of this class). The only pronblem is that it requires to be initialize with a simple implementation class of `LoggingUtils`, which should use the default. I think that this design does not break the behaviour of GATK, but introduce more complexity in the code. If you think that this is worthy, I could implement it today. @lbergelson, I'm not able to run Spark tools in a cluster yet, neither in gcloud dataproc, sorry.

(As a contributing developer to a documentation auto-generator --the GATKDocs-- I can tell you that is not necessarily trivial and adds even more moving parts.) This also generates additional complexity for third-party developers of wrappers (such as Galaxy). Finally, it can be a source of confusion for users who are trying to look up an argument called ""-dont-Trim-whatever"" since presumably it's only going to be listed under T (-Trim-whatever) and not under D in the alphabetical list.

Integrability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now.

As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace.

Naively, one could make this scale as |L| + |XL| by querying each variant in the input vcf against L and then against XL. For reasons @cmnbroad points out this is not a great solution, but it seems like because (i) L and XL are ordered and (ii) each L overlaps with only a sparse subset of XL and vice versa that this quadratic scaling is not necessary.

Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call).

Integrability,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to replicate GATK3 behavior in GATK4. The GATK4 VariantWalker iterates all variants from VCF(s), calling apply() once per variant. If the input VCFs has duplicates at a given location, apply() is called multiple times for the same locus. In GATK3, VariantEval iterates each locus, and generates a list of variants at that site. I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to do this in GATK4. One solution is to override traverse(), and add some kind of groupingBy step, for example:. StreamSupport.stream(getSpliteratorForDrivingVariants(), false); .filter(variantfilter); .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> new SimpleInterval(x))); .values(); .forEach(variantList -> {; final SimpleInterval variantInterval = new SimpleInterval(variantList.get(0));; apply(variantList,; new ReadsContext(reads, variantInterval, readFilter),; new ReferenceContext(reference, variantInterval),; new FeatureContext(features, variantInterval));. progressMeter.update(variantInterval);; });. This will get me the right end result (like of variants per site); however, it's not clear to me if this is the most efficient route, and I'm not sure if it's aware of the sorted input. Because the input data are sorted, I could iterate, track the previous location and maintain a list of track variants per site. Each time we hit a new location I call apply() with that list. Are the places in GATK4 that already do this type of per-locus grouping?.

Integrability,"I'm using GATK4 as a framework to implement my own tools, and it will be nice to have a way of perform integration tests using `IntegrationTestSpec`. Nevertheless, it requires the extension of the `CommandLineProgramTest` to run the command, and thus it is extending `BaseTest`. The issues that this infrastructure generates when trying to use this test classes are the following:; - `BaseTest` loading of `GenomeLocParser` is annotated with `@BeforeClass`, which throws an error because the reference genome (hg19MiniReference) is not present in the repository.; - `CommandLineProgramTest` is using `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main` for running the commands, but for custom tools the instanceMain with a different list of packages. Although this could be solved by extending the class by another abstract class. I propose (and I can implemented if you agree) the following:; - `CommandLineProgramTest` not implementing `BaseTest`.; - `CommandLineProgramTest` as a real abstract class without implementations of `getTestDataDir()` or `runCommandLine()`; - Abstract `GATKCommandLineProgramTest` extending both `CommandLineProgramTest` and `BaseTest`, sited in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.test` and used in all integrations tests in this repository and the protected repository.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2033:103,integrat,integration,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2033,3,"['Integrat', 'integrat']","['IntegrationTestSpec', 'integration', 'integrations']"

Note also that we needlessly select the worst scoring variants here, which leads to the bad behavior as well as a misleading log message. There is also some residual funkiness from the fact that we require the specification of the number of training variants in order to construct a GMM from a serialized model, which is a result of further funkiness from the fact that we require the size of the array of responsibilities to be initialized using this number. Unfortunately, I don't think there's an easy fix, since we don't actually pass either the correct positive/negative training labels (in the recal table generated by the original run) or the necessary information to reconstruct them otherwise (e.g., we could repeat the VQSLOD calculations, given the original training subset sites and VQSLOD cutoffs used to originally derive the negative labels) to these subsequent runs. (Unless we actually want to pass those things, which seems messy.). Note also that the `POSITIVE_TRAIN_SITE` label is still applied to sites that get dropped because of standard deviation thresholding and are hence not used to train the positive GMM, which seems slightly inconsistent (since the `NEGATIVE_TRAIN_SITE`",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7630:930,message,message,930,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7630,1,['message'],['message']

Then ask the CNV team to prototype an example tool or two that use `PythonScriptExecutor` to call into a Python machine-learning library, and do an assessment of maintainability, etc. `PythonScriptExecutor` will come with an attached set of conditions for its use, intended to address the most serious issues raised by the engine and support teams with having Python code in the GATK. We should document these conditions in the docs for `PythonScriptExecutor` when it's implemented:. 1. All tools that use `PythonScriptExecutor` must have a Java-based front-end, with standard GATK (barclay-based) arguments. We put a lot of development effort into our arg parser and into striving for user-interface consistency across tools, and cannot afford to duplicate this effort in Python. Geraldine (CC'd) and the rest of the support team can back me up on this one!. 2. An honest effort should be made to minimize the amount of code written in Python -- as much of each tool's work as possible should be done in Java. In particular, reading/writing final inputs and outputs should happen in Java. This is important for a number of reasons, including the engine team's goal of ensuring universal GCS support, consistent Google authentication handling, etc. Again, we really don't want to have to duplicate that work in Python, or for the tools that call into Python to be inconsistent with the rest of the toolkit. 3.

Users pass in a configuration table (see tool documentation for an example) specifying one or more stratification groups classified by SVTYPE, SVLEN range, and reference context(s). The latter are specified as a set of interval lists using `--context-name` and `--context-intervals` arguments. All variants are matched with their respective group which is annotated in the `STRAT` INFO field.

Integrability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Integrability,"In the previous version of GATK, a multi-sample pileup (already stratified by sample) was handled with a different class to be more efficient while performing operations by sample or re-splitting.

Instead of using a `List<PileupElement>` internally, `ReadPileup` could have an `ElementTracker` field, that could implement splitting, sorting by position and other operations to improve the efficiency. This may solve issues like https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2245.

Does such a thing exist for GCS as well? If not, would it be easy to implement?

Integrability,"Investigating.

When we include both dependencies, gradles bumps everything to protobuf 3.x and this seems to break the Hadoop libraries. I can reproduce the problem on master without even adding a gcs dependency, just by adding a protobuf 3.x dependency. ```; $ git diff build.gradle; + compile 'com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.0.0-beta-2'; $ ./gradlew clean test --tests '*ReadsSparkSourceUnitTest.testReadFromFileAndHDFS'; Gradle suite > Gradle test > org.broadinstitute.hellbender.engine.spark.datasources.ReadsSparkSourceUnitTest.testReadFromFileAndHDFS FAILED; org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError): Could not initialize class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos; ```. The problem does not reproduce (at least not for this particular test) if I use an earlier version of the protobuf jar (3.0.0-beta-1). I just tried the whole test suite and it passed.

Integrability,"Is this the only `CommandLineException` which should be an `UserException`? If not, how is going to work the development of new exceptions in Barclay. For instance, in https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/pull/11 there is a new exception that I made for values out of range, which extends `BadArgumentValue`. I agree that this errors should be decoupled from the ones that are not, but in this case I think that this is already implemented:. * `UserException` are handled in the `mainEntry()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the user's side regarding some specifications in the tools/framework.; * `CommandLineException` are handled in `parseArgs()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the command line from the user side while parsing. I expect that any command line error that is not `CommandLineParserInternalException ` or `ShouldNeverReachHereException` comes from the user's side. The contract in Barclay says that are `CommandLineException` are _""Exceptions thrown by CommandLineParser implementations.""_, and I think that if other parts of the code (outside arg parsing) is throwing this exception is a bug that does not come from the user. I guess that this is the problematic part.; * Any other `Exception` is thrown in `Main.handleNonUserException()`, which may be caused by non-user exceptions. I propose that `CommandLineException` is handled as currently to separate ""errors that are the user's fault regarding input and/or assumptions"" (`UserException`), ""errors that are the user's fault while providing parameters to the command line"" (`CommandLineException`) and ""errors that are not the user's fault"" (other `Exception`s). Actually, this is reasonable because the exit status is different for any kind of errors in the current `Main`. The only problem that I see with this approach is the silently failing of a ""bug"" in tools/engine code, which can be rethrow easily in `CommandLineProgram.instanceMain`` as following:. ```java; public Object instanceMain(final Strin",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161:906,contract,contract,906,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161,1,['contract'],['contract']

And okay, I understand that an aligner could represent this as a G->T subsitution, but what about the same thing but with 2D followed by 2I? That strikes me as a much better cigar than calling it a DNP. In general, a bad cigar should mean either that the aligner is bad (in which case why are we filtering isolated reads and not just rejecting the entire BAM?) or the read is malformed.

Every time I had this message, this was due to bcftools which can change some float values to an integer representation : (e.g : before bcftools : MQ=31.0; after bcftools : MQ=31). .

Integrability,"It was a feature which we would have loved, but alas this isn't the case. We also relied on ```-ct``` to get percent of bases depending on their coverage (ex. 20x) which has now been dropped in GATK 4+ versions.

When compared to DepthOfCoverage - ; - It uses multithreading (albeit only for deflation, so no performance gains when going beyond 4 threads).; - It gives coverage for exome within 5 minutes, and even faster when we don't need the per base coverage output.; - Per base coverage output can be skipped using ```-x``` the output of this matches closely to output from DepthOfCoverage. Do keep in mind, DepthOfCoverage also supports this skipping when using the parameter ```--omitDepthOutputAtEachBase``` which saves massively on I/O and cuts processing time from 50 minutes per sample to 40 minutes per sample. If you do decide to give it a try, we have some tips and suggestions - ; - The tool generates multiple output files. If looking for total coverage, check the last line of file ```output.mosdepth.summary.txt```; - If looking for percent of bases covered at target read depth, this information is present in file ```output.mosdepth.region.dist.txt```. If your target read depth is 20x, you can search this file with ```grep -P ""total\t20\t""``` and the third column should be the percentage (with only one decimal); - By using ```-d4``` switch, they claim the above percentage granularity increases to 4 decimal points.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071:126,depend,depending,126,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"Just got an update by email from the GP team indicating that their perspective is that these are valid index files. It seems that this issue lives in a liminal space where Mutect2 is crashing due to reasons that are not a GATK bug, but also not due to any formal problem in the GP pipeline either. Still, I'm running Broad-built software on recently sequenced Broad-provided genetic data, so it seems a little odd that these aren't playing well together. Trying to think of a solution so that other people in this situation aren't left confused by the error message, is this error specific enough that an additional statement could be added to the error message, e.g., ""This error may be triggered by CRAM indexes produced by older implementations of `htsjdk`, in which case reindexing with an updated `htsjdk` may resolve this problem.""?

Integrability,"Looking at the stack trace, the error takes place in a low-level BAM input reading component in a dependency library.... It seems that is trying to read as a number portions of the contig name for a read record in the input... which makes very little sense.... . My guess is that either it is a bug entirely contained in that library (is the name seqdoop?), say it does not tolerate those contig names, or that the user managed to input a bam file that isn't formatted correctly on those records.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3357#issuecomment-317817540:98,depend,dependency,98,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3357#issuecomment-317817540,1,['depend'],['dependency']
Integrability,"Looks like all packages *except* ggplot2 were successfully installed. The following lines in the R script are responsible for installing 3 of the packages:. ```; dependencies = c(""ggplot2"",""gplots"",""gsalib""); repos <- c(""http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu"",; ""https://cran.mtu.edu"",; ""http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/""); missing <- which(!(dependencies %in% rownames(installed.packages()))); try <- 1; while(length(missing)!=0 & try <= length(repos)) {; install.packages(dependencies[missing], repos = repos[try], clean = TRUE); missing <- which(!(dependencies %in% rownames(installed.packages()))); try <- try + 1; }; ```. I guess this is supposed to ensure that the installs don't fail due to intermittent connection errors, etc., but each repo is only hit once and it's possible for the loop to exit with dependencies still missing. Could this have happened when the current base image was built and pushed? @jamesemery did you push this image?. Also, I learned that *reshape2* (as opposed to reshape) is actually a dependency of ggplot2 that is automatically installed along with ggplot2. So the original removal of reshape from the `install.packages` list was fine. However, the import statement that is removed in this PR fails whether or not ggplot2 successfully installs, and is extraneous in any case. This is all consistent with the fact that the users from the forum post only get an error message about reshape and not ggplot2. Note that they are using broadinstitute/gatk:4.0.4.0, in which ggplot2 is successfully installed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406028261:162,depend,dependencies,162,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406028261,7,"['depend', 'message']","['dependencies', 'dependency', 'message']"

Integrability,"Looks like the problem occurs when the cram dictionary is ""compatible"" with the reference dictionary according to our validation routines, but the reference dictionary does not contain all contigs from the cram dictionary. We are going to make our dictionary validation stricter to prevent this (https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/issues/802). We should also patch htsjdk to throw a nicer error than `NullPointerException` in this case -- ie., insert a check after `CRAMIterator` line 158 that throws a `RuntimeException` with a nice ""contig from cram header not found in reference"" message if refs == null.

Integrability,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:1348,message,messages,1348,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"Nice that HTSJDK is moving forward to version 3. The points that I would like to address are similar to yours, with some inclussions. * Regarding NIO support, I would go to remove completely `File` support. If API users need to use the `File` abstraction, they should convert to a `java.nio.Path` using the `toPath` method.; * In addition, I would like that HTTP/S and FTP is handled also with NIO. For HTTP/S, I am working in a simple `FileSystemProvider` that should be good enough for using in combination with HTSJDK ([jsr203-http](https://github.com/magicDGS/jsr203-http)), and I can speed up the development there for needs in HTSJDK; for FTP, maybe [ftp-fs](https://github.com/robtimus/ftp-fs) can be used or a simple implementation can be derived from the HTTP/S implementation (without credentials). This will remove the special handling of HTTP/S and FTP paths in HTSJDK in favor of a consistent and pluggable manner.; * Interfaces for the data types are great, and maybe it will be good to have codec interfaces for both encoding and decoding. For example, I am missing encoders in tribble (an attempt in https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/822 for writing support).; * For VCF, I would like to have a less diploid-centric interface and design, or at least a way of configure the catching of genotype-related attributes. Currently there are methods for homozygotes/heterozygotes that aren't really useful for triploids or even VCFs without variation (for example, in Pool-Seq data).; * Modular design for artifacts: thus, a project with only SAM/BAM requirements will require only `htsjdk-sam`, and if they also want CRAM support, `htsjdk-cram`. See https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/issues/896 for more info about it.; * Common license for all HTSJDK, or at least for each module. This will be good for taking into account legal concerns when including the library, because now there is a mixture depending on the files that are used. This is what is coming to my mind now.

Integrability,"Not bad, but why can't the BAM be split as multiple objects in the same bucket where the directory is the name of the BAM. I was having this discussion with Dion at the following thread:. https://github.com/googlegenomics/utils-java/issues/62#issuecomment-220444203. You can have a folder in the GS location be the name of the BAM, and even sort them like a distributed B-tree. This way you can even simultaneously process reads as new data is streaming in from the GS location. Since the Google disk IOPS are as follows, based on the following link:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#type_comparison. | Read | Write |; | --- | --- |; | 3000 IOPS | 0 IOPS |; | 2250 IOPS | 3750 IOPS |; | 1500 IOPS | 7500 IOPS |; | 750 IOPS | 11250 IOPS |; | 0 IOPS | 15000 IOPS |. So it all depends on perspective of what folks prefer, which in this case means that we can minimize the 6 min component. Then comes the 1.5 min portion of HDFS, which can occur in parallel and could also be memory-mapped and/or SSD accessed. So there are still ways to improve the access and processing time, but it depends on how fast - or instantaneous - folks want to have the results processed and returned back.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1755#issuecomment-235130868:798,depend,depends,798,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1755#issuecomment-235130868,2,['depend'],['depends']

Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately. Here is the list of packages that get pulled in by the R install: ```autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils bsdmainutils build-essential; bzip2-doc cdbs cpp cpp-5 debhelper dh-strip-nondeterminism dh-translations; dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-5 gcc gcc-5 gettext gettext-base gfortran; gfortran-5 groff-base ifupdown intltool intltool-debian iproute2; isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libalgorithm-diff-perl; libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libarchive-zip-perl; libasan2 libasprintf-dev libasprintf0v5 libatm1 libatomic1; libauthen-sasl-perl libblas-common libblas-dev libblas3 libbz2-dev; libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libcroco3 libcurl3; libdns-export162 libdpkg-perl libencode-locale-perl libfakeroot; libfile-basedir-perl libfile-desktopentry-perl libfile-fcntllock-perl; libfile-listing-perl libfile-mimeinfo-perl libfile-stripnon",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954:90,depend,dependencies,90,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954,5,['depend'],"['depend', 'dependencies']"

Integrability,"OK, I think things are looking good! Updated a bunch of things, including the following:. - conda 23.1.0 -> 23.10.0; in the base Docker, also disabled conda auto-updating and set the solver to the much faster libmamba (NOTE: before this PR went in, this change was actually made in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610); - python 3.6.10 -> 3.10.13; - pymc 3.1 -> 5.10.0; - theano 1.0.4 -> pytensor 2.18.1; - added pytorch 2.1.0; - removed tensorflow 1.15.0 and other CNN dependencies; - added libblas-dev to the base Docker; I think MKL versions of all packages are being used, but we should verify!. These and other packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) are all pretty much at the latest available versions for python 3.10. I've also bumped version numbers for our internal python packages. I also made all of the changes to the gCNV code to accommodate any changes introduced by PyMC/Pytensor. For the most part, these were minor renamings of `theano`/`tt`/etc. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors).

Integrability,"OK. I found a potential solution. For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2. This means that we have only one GKL for both GATK 3 and 4, at the expense of having to keep to config files, `log4j.properties` and `log4j2.xml`, in sync (which they probably should have been anyway, thought they weren't).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413:89,depend,dependencies,89,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413,1,['depend'],['dependencies']

Since `GenotypeGVCFs` is a RodWalker and does not use input reads (BAM file), the shard size is `1,000,000`. ; This might be more than a thread safety bug (which is easy to fix, by making `GenotypingEngine.calculateOutputAlleleSubset() ` `synchronized`). What worries me is If the cache of upstream deletions spans intervals, this code will not work since the processing is asynchronous.

Integrability,"Originally by @vruano in Classic GATK Pivotal. Improve the read threading process in order to minimize loss of information without affecting the accuracy of calls. . Here I list a few details and ideas to take in consideration:. A. Currently (unless recover of dangling heads is active) we start threading at the first unique kmer of the read (sequence). There are at least two unsound aspect to this approach:. A.1 Since we are generating those vertices as we thread the resulting graph and edge weights may be different depending of the sequence (read) threading order. . A.2 We are throwing away information located at the beginning of the read before the first unique (and existing) k-mer in each sequence is found. This is partly fixed by the approach taken when we recover dangling heads yet it seems to have other problems downstream when selecting or pruning haplotypes:. ```; https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67601310; ```. B. Low support chain pruning might not be longer needed. Now we have a newer approach to select best haplotypes that can handle complex graph we might well not need to prune low supported hap early as they seemly they won't be selected if the are not amongst the best haplotypes. . B.1 Now that still would produce a considerable number of unlikely haplotypes that would cause a CPU burden. That can be changed by imposing another kinds of limit, For example we include all haplotypes with scores (likelihoods) that are Q0 - Q40 or we include haplotypes until the sum of their likelihoods is larger than the 99.99% probability mass. . B.2 This could provide a downstream solution to the problem caused by ranging heads recovery (explained above in A.2). B.3 If pruning is to be maintained, it makes more sense to do it at the very end after all dangling ends hav been recovered and the edges supports are finalized. Of course I assuming here that dangling end recovery does the sensible think of updating those supports are the graphs is modified. C.

AR traversal comes out with different active region boundaries because the engine used takes as a parameter the ploidy.

Integrability,"Our R dependency is primarily for producing plots. It could be possible to create plots using javascript instead. Javascript plots have several potential advantages but also several major downsides. The biggest and most obvious drawback is that we don't have any code to produce them yet, and they are likely harder to generate and experiment with than R scripts. . The advantage would be that we could avoid requiring an R installation to run hellbender scripts, we could potentially also include interactive plotting or other neat tricks to make the plots more useful. I see 2 possible routes to replacing Rscripts with javascript. The first would be for tools that require graphs to perform some html generation and produce html reports with embedded javascript. The user could then open these in their browser and view the plots ( much like how our test suite report and jacoco is done). . A different option would be to use javascript plotting libraries directly within the jvm to generate SVG. Java 8 has a new javascript engine which is supposed to be reasonably fast and offers access to java objects from within it. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a full DOM like a browser does, so most existing javascript libraries will fall over. It seems like it would take a lot of hacking to get something like d3 to run directly on the jvm.

Integrability,"Overall, this looks fine, just a few minor comments. Two broader questions/issues:; - Does the test data exercise all of the code paths and edge cases?; - In general, putting the majority of testing in integration tests instead of unit tests is bad pattern. It have several bad consequences (1) it becomes less clear which cases are being tested (2) it's slower than just running unit tests and (3) it makes it unhelpful to (perhaps someday) move to a testing framework that only runs tests relevant to the code directly affected (because all integration tests must be run).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1013#issuecomment-149599490:202,integrat,integration,202,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1013#issuecomment-149599490,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"R addresses two phasing bugs, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 identified a bug in the phasing algorithm which caused the wrong phase information to be output for scenarios where the first variant in a phase set is homozygous variant and it is followed by het variants in opposite phase. Without this change the het variants were incorrectly placed on the same phase strand because the phase set was tied to the hom var variant, and the algorithm assumed that each het variant could be put in the same phase strand as it because it was on all haplotypes. I've modified the algorithm to keep track, for variants that occur on all haplotypes, of which of the haplotypes have already been used for phasing an upstream ""comp"" variant so that further downstream variants can be checked against the remaining set. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845 showed an example of phase sets being disrupted by the presence of an alternate haplotype that supported an additional, uncalled, variant in the region. In this case there was an alternate haplotype supported by two reads that supported a SNP downstream of two pairs of SNPs in alternate phase. The presence of an additional haplotype causes the phasing algorithm to break the phase sets in the region. I've modified the algorithm to only use haplotypes that support the alternate alleles present in called variants in phasing by modifying the number that we pass as `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.constructPhaseSetMapping()`'s `totalAvailableHaplotypes` parameter. In my opinion this ; fix produces output that is still correct and is much easier to understand (since it only depends on sites that are visible in the output VCF), but if anyone objects to this change please let me know. .

Integrability,"Ran into this when trying to create a PoN with 100 samples x 100 bp bins = 1.27 * max int elements. This currently causes issues when truncating outliers, at which point all elements are loaded into an array so that Percentiles can be naively computed, resulting in a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException`. Solutions include: 1) simply throwing a message and failing early if the counts matrix is too large (perhaps recommend scattering by contig, see #4728), 2) changing the outlier truncation procedure to be more robust. I'm not sure how important outlier truncation is to the SVD, as it remains to be evaluated, but for now we should be able to get around this with no code changes by simply disabling it (i.e., setting the relevant truncation percentile to 0). Note that file I/O takes about an hour for this case. Also note that this is probably on the extreme end of what we should expect to support on a single machine with all counts in memory, as the SVD is probably sufficiently good with 100 samples and 100 bp is on the order of the read length. #4728 will get around this and also make downstream tasks complete faster in parallel, at the very small expense of reducing a few global parameters to per-contig parameters in the modeling step.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4734:348,message,message,348,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4734,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"Rationale for engine changes:; This tool opens a large number of feature files (TSVs, not VariantContexts) and iterates over them simultaneously. No querying, just a single pass through each.; Issue 1: When a feature file lives in the cloud, it takes unacceptably long (several seconds, typically) to initialize it. A few seconds doesn't seem like a long time, but when there are large numbers of feature files to open, it adds up. This is caused by a large number of codecs (mostly the vcf-processing codecs) opening and reading the first few bytes of the file in the canDecode method. To avoid this I've reversed the order in which we test each codec, checking first if it produces the correct subtype of Feature, and only then calling canDecode. If you don't know what specific subtype you need, you can just ask for any Feature by passing Feature.class. It's much faster that way.; Issue 2: Each open feature source soaks up a huge amount of memory. That's because text-based feature reading is optimized for VCFs, which can have enormously long lines. So huge buffers are allocated. The problem is compounded for cloud-based feature files for which we allocate a large cloud prefetch buffer. (Though that feature can be turned off, which helps a little.) But the biggest memory hog is the TabixReader, which always reads in the index, regardless of whether it's used or not. Tabix indices are very large. To avoid this, I've created a smaller, simpler FeatureReader subclass called a TextFeatureReader that loads the index only when necessary. The revisions allow the new tool to run using an order of magnitude less memory. Faster, too.; Issue 3: The code in FeatureDataSource that creates a FeatureReader is brittle, and tests for various subclasses. To allow use of the new TextFeatureReader, I added a FeatureReaderFactory interface that allows one to ask the codec for an appropriate FeatureReader.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770:1832,interface,interface,1832,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"Resolves issue #1370 by exposing the setting for Spark logging level with a separate CLI argument (`--spark-verbosity`). Also stifles overly-verbose executor INFO-level logging by setting the default to WARN. This was much cleaner to implement than just applying the existing `--verbosity` to the Spark context for a few reasons. First, Spark's `INFO` level is far too verbose, but most GATK tools provide useful INFO messages. This gives the user the ability to tune them separately. Also, Spark offers more levels through log4j, and mapping from htsjdk logging levels with a bunch of `if` statements didn't seem ideal. Verbose logging only seems to be a problem with when running `/gatk/gatk` inside the GATK docker (eg PathSeq log files easily in 100's of MB). Strangely, however, I found there was no verbose logging if I cloned GATK inside the docker and rebuilt from source with `gradlew buildAll`. Since I can't pinpoint the cause, I haven't included tests for this, but I don't expect test coverage to drop. Note that Spark generates some INFO logging when the context is initialized.

Integrability,"See the ScatterIntervals and related tasks in the gCNV WDLs at the link above. The idea is to performs multiple runs of gCNV in shards of >10,000 intervals each across the exome. These shards can be specified by passing the set of intervals for each shard via the -L argument to GermlineCNVCaller. The gCNV model is independently fit in each shard, using the global depth and contig-level ploidy parameters determined across the whole exome in the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy step. The shards are then stitched together in the PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls step. I believe we typically run shards of 10,000 intervals for cohorts of 100-200 samples using n1-standard-8 machines, which have 30GB of memory (although looking at some recent runs, I think we've used as few as 5,000 intervals per shard).

Integrability,"Some factors to consider in making this decision:. -Operations on zero-length intervals are error-prone due to lack of understanding/consensus about expected results (eg., should a query on a zero-length interval return records that abut it on either side?). -We need to determine how a query involving a zero-length interval is supposed to behave in the GA4GH API, as this does not seem to be clearly defined in the API documentation (eg., http://ga4gh.org/documentation/api/v0.5.1/ga4gh_api.html#/schema/%2FUsers%2Fkeenan%2FDropbox%2Fgit-checkouts%2Fschemas%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Favro%2Ftarget%2Fall.avpr/org.ga4gh.GASearchReadsRequest). The representation is 0-based closed-open (like BED), which means zero-length intervals are possible, but their behavior appears undefined. -None of our current query interfaces (tribble/samtools) support computing overlap with zero-length intervals (although they don't throw an error when given such an interval -- they just never return any records for such queries). -It seems unlikely that we'll be moving anytime soon to representing insertions using zero-length intervals, given that the VCF spec requires insertions to be represented in terms of the preceding reference base.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/317:812,interface,interfaces,812,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/317,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"Some questions before this is code reviewed in detail:. 1) A number of query methods in GoogleGenomicsReadAdapter adapter; throw if the corresponding field is not present in the underlying read. For some; of these there are guard methods you can call to avoid this (see for example; the changes in ReadUtils.java), but for some of the others I'm not sure how to; usefully query the state without already knowing the answer, ie.:. -isSupplementaryAlignment; -isSecondaryAlignment,; -failsVendorQualityCheck; -isDuplicate; -mateIsReverseStrand. To have fidelity with SAMRecord.getSAMString , we need to be able to query these; (as does ReadUtils.getFlags, which has a similar problem, but I changed that to; use guard methods to prevent throwing). In a couple of cases I had to change; the Read adapter to not throw. We need to figure out if this kind; of change is ok. or what the alternative is. 2) This is incidental to this PR, but there are a few inconsistencies between how; GenomicsConverter.makeSAMRecord and ReadUtils compute derived state values, ie. flags.; I can work around these in the getSAMString tests (I'm using Read->SAMRecord; conversions to validate the tests), but the underlying format conversions; are inconsistent. Should we align them ?. For example, GenomicsConverter sets the firstInPair flag on the SAMRecord if readNumber==0,; even if numberOfReads==1, whereas the ReadUtils/GoogleReadAdapter requires readNumber==0; and numberOfReads==2. Likewise the unmapped flag is determined differently: Genomics converter: (http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html):; final boolean unmapped = (read.getAlignment() == null || ; read.getAlignment().getPosition() == null || ; read.getAlignment().getPosition().getPosition() == null);; ReadUtils:; private boolean positionIsUnmapped( final Position position ) {; return position == null ||; position.getReferenceName() == null || position.getReferenceName().equals(SAMRecord.NO_ALIGNMENT_REFERENCE_NAME) ||; ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/871:114,adapter,adapter,114,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/871,2,['adapter'],['adapter']

Two options might be: 1) distribute native libraries for supported architectures with gatk or 2) make sure gatk docker images include the native libraries and are set to use them.

Integrability,"Still not sure why the tests failed randomly! all XHMM-related tests use their own RNG with fixed seeds and there are no RNG calls in any parallel streams. Therefore, the randomly generated test data must be identical and fully deterministic across all runs. However, it did not appear to be the case! some test runs triggered a bug in HMMPostProcessor (see below) and some runs didn't. I removed a few unnecessary RNGs and the issue is not reproducible anymore. In particular, both XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator had their own RNG but then again, if the tests are run in a deterministic order, it shouldn't matter. The good news is the bug in HMMPostProcessor is fixed; the bad news is, I still don't know why the tests were not deterministic. I bet the failing issue is (magically!) fixed as a result of pulling out the RNG from XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator. If it occurs again, I'll investigate more. - fixed a bug in HMMPostProcessor that required all samples to be queried in the given list of genotyping segments every time (origin of the failing tests: sometimes the randomly generated genotyping segments contained fewer samples than all samples available for genotyping); - got rid of the unnecessary RNG in XHMMModel to make it stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - also made XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - truncated the target list used in XHMM integration tests (cuts down the test time by a factor of 10)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140:1455,integrat,integration,1455,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"Summary of changes:. - Fixed a minor issue in sampling error estimation that could lead to NaN (as a result of division by zero). - Introduced separate _internal_ and _external_ admixing rates. The _internal_ admixing rate is to be used internally by discrete RV posterior update routines (""callers"") as a safety measure to stabilize self-consistency loops. For example, consider the mean-field treatment of two coupled Markov chains: the mean-field decoupling of the two chains yields two independent Markov chains with effective emission, transition, and prior probabilities, all of which must be self-consistency determined. The internal admixing rate would be used to admix the old and new self-consistent fields across the two chains in order to dampen oscillations and improve convergence properties. Once internal convergence is achieved, the converged posteriors must be saved to a workspace in order to be consumed by the continuous sub-model. The new internally converged posteriors will be admixed with the old internally converged posteriors from the previous epoch with the _external_ admixing rate. - Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling. In the first (""warm-up"") stage, discrete variables are marginalized out, yielding an effective continuous-only model. The warm-up stage calculates continuous posteriors based on the marginalized model. Once convergence is achieved, continuous and discrete variables are decoupled for the second (""main"") stage. The second stage starts with a discrete calling step (crucial), using continuous posteriors from the warm-up stage as the starting point. The motivation behind the two-stage inference strategy is to avoid getting trapped in spurious local minima that are potentially introduced by mean-field decoupling of discrete and continuous RVs. Note that mean-field decoupling has a tendency to stabilize local minima, most of which will disappear or turn into saddle points once correlations are taken into account.
